The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"it burns, and is awful for sensitive and dry skin"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The gel peel was easy to apply and because it is such a deep color you can't really miss in applying an even coat.
That being said, I first applied the chemical and waited 9 minutes, but nothing happened. I mean no itch or warming sensation at all.
I do not have super sensitive skin, but my skin is sensitive. I waited 48 hours, but nothing peeled or changed at all. I put on a second time to give it a second chance, but there was still no change. I bought it because of all the hype from the reviews, but this product is just hype. The price I paid for it and the seller I bought it from were the only positive things I can say about the product.
I am a white male at the age of 46.
Just to make sure anyone understands that I truly tested this product. The area I tried the product on was my face and the other was my private area to try and get rid of hyper pigmentation. I left it on my private area for 45 minutes to just make sure that the product is a waste of time.
People are buying this product for two main reasons. First, the cheap price that makes it inexpensive to buy and the other being all the high rated reviews saying that this product works so good."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been a long journey for me to give you this review. Like you, I wanted so badly for this product to work, and bought it expecting results. First few times I used it I did as directed, left on for 10 mins and did once a week. Did not notice any change any of those times, so I started using it twice a week and still didnt see results. SO I upped my usage to every other day, and left on for 2 mins longer than it says to, and finally started to see a clearer complexion overall. Like you, I saw the bad reviews on here and so I ended up buying another directly from their website (cheaper on there too!) and used it for the first time last night. WOW, it was like night and day. It burnt the crap out of my face properly like an acid peel is intended to, and I woke up with phenomenal results. Such good results that I had to put in my review, its only 7:40 a.m. Do not buy this inferior product, go directly to the website. You are wasting your time if you buy from here. Pretty sure all the people seeing results with this product are all experiencing the placebo effect."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m very familiar with aha products… the directions say to leave on no more than 10 minutes. Normally I have difficulty waiting the full 10 minutes because I have sensitive skin. I can leave this product on overnight (and have) with zero tingling, as well as zero benefit. Very disappointing. Will have to go out of my way calling customer support to return. Not happy"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I tried this product out because I thought it would help me with my acne and it had amazing reviews. The first time I tried it was fine, but then the second time I tried it there was EXTREME discomfort. It was the worst pain I have ever felt on my face, and I couldn't leave it on for more than a minute because I was in so much pain.

I am so lucky because it did not give me a chemical burn, but NO ONE should buy this product! There are too many chemicals for the average face. After I took it off, I researched more about it and there are a lot of people who have been in my situation, or had it WAY worse. Anyways, save your money. Just because social media says its good, it isn't.

I ALSO tried to get a refund on the product, and they said I can't. So that is also very fun..."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I never really considered myself someone with particularly delicate skin. I'd say my skin type is ""normal"", with a slightly oilier t-zone than cheek area. For context, I'm 35, white, female. I was hoping for a brightening peel that would pep up my dull, winter-weary skin. This took off my whole winter-weary face. I experienced light tingling during use but nothing significant, washed it off, it wasn't until an hour later that my skin started to get red and puffy accompanied by a severe burning sensation. I tried washing my face again and applying face oil but nothing helped. My face was raw and red for 2-3 days, followed by ungodly peeling (luckily no sustained scarring). I have other products from this line and have tried other peels from other brands; this is the only time I've had such a painful, alarming reaction. Seems to work for a lot of people, but my experience was pretty horrendous."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is just not for me, unfortunately. I have oily, acne prone skin, with little sensitivity to pretty much any skincare product but this product I had such a sensitivity to, sadly. The first time I used this, everything was fine, no reaction, left on for 10 minutes, an hour later my face was itchy. I thought nothing of it, but I did notice that the cystic acne on the side of my face was noticeably worse. The second time I used this, the itching was immediate and intense! I washed it off as soon as I could, and could not be more mortified. Thankfully, nothing happened to my skin, but who knows what would have happened had I not washed it off immediately. Right now, I think I’ll just stick to personal microdermabrasion and vitamin a.
Don’t let this review scare you, because I know so many people who like this product, but be cautious of what you could be allergic to!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm 42 and actively treating sun damage accumulated during my 20s. I've been using 10% AHA (Paula's Choice) on a weekly basis, for about a year now, to help with uneven texture and dry, rough patches - with noticeable results. I was ready for something stronger. I bought this and left it on for 10 minutes the first time since 30% AHA seemed serious, but didn't notice any results. The second time I left it on for 20 minutes, but still no difference in my skin. The third time I left it on for 45 minutes before rinsing it off in the shower. I felt nothing. My skin did not feel any softer as I rinsed the product off. I regularly use other products by The Ordinary that I purchased from Sephora (Buffet, Granactive Retinol, HA Moisturizer, Rosehip Oil Serum) and those have been game changers for me. This should have been much stronger. Complete waste of $$$."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so excited to try this peel. I don't have abnormally sensitive skin and get enzyme facials once a month without issues. I tried this on Sunday evening, left it on for 8 minutes - did not experience any tingling or any discomfort, was careful when I washed it off and applied a good moisturizer afterwards. Monday my skin felt a little dry, so I used a heavier cream during the day (one that I use often). When I woke up Tuesday morning, I had a rash all around my lower face kind of like a beard! It's super itchy and irritated still. I'm putting fresh aloe vera pulp on it hoping that it will calm it down and promote healing...guess I should have done a patch test before smearing it all over my face."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"It really sucked to see that my order had finally shipped, just to check the mail and it was damaged! I was really excited to use this product as I have seen so many good reviews on tiktok! I was originally suppose to receive the product 6/4, but did not receive it until 6/15. Which tells me it is a high demand and probably great product! Only I won’t get a chance to find out."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not for everyone - I started using this about two weeks ago. Following the instructions strictly, I have used it 3 times. I felt slight irritation but that's very common with this product. Result - THIS SPOILED MY SKIN. My skin used to be very smooth in texture, after first application I noticed bumps and pimples on my face which wasn't there before. With continuous use, it worsened the perfectly fine skin I had before. It didn't feel just like purging, this product made me break out really bad with acne and cysts. I love other ordinary products I have tried. So I think it's AHA - BHA in general which didn't suit /work for me."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So I have super sensitive skin, and I knew it was a possibility trying this product, HOWEVER I was completely bamboozled when it worked perfectly the first time! It was amazing, didn’t tingle or anything. About a week and a half later I used it again, upon applying it burned the ever living crap out of my face. I don’t know what was different? It has done the same every time I have applied since and I would have to immediate wipe it off. I wish my skin wasn’t so needy so I could use this product to its full potential :/"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This did nothing for my skin. No peeling, no help with discoloration nothing. It didn't matter how long I left it on it was like having deep purple dye on my face. If that's the look your going for do it. But I consider this a waste of coin. Would I buy it again?. That's a big no."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"So I was really excited to try this product out because I've suffered from acne and wanted to use this product to help with the marks and scars left behind, but when I took off the mask, nothing happened. And I don't mean that like I expected for this product to take a layer of my skin off in just application, its just that I felt no tingling, stinging, or any sensation, and when I removed the mask it didn't even leave my face red like my other chemical mask peels. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, or if it's the product itself, but I was really let down."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm thoroughly disappointed with this product. Thus is a review from someone who does not have sensitive skin: I have oily/normal skin. I heard the hype and thought I should check it out.

The last time I had a pimple or breakout was about 6 months ago. I decided to buy this for my black heads, but instead of helping my skin this product gave me a pimple and and skin breakout. I suggest you do not buy this overpriced and skin irritating product."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I saw an ad about this product on IG and I immediately bought it on Amazon, however it doesnt do what it says it does. Been trying this product for almost 2 months now and even though it’s an uncomfortable product to leave on your face because it stings and doesn’t smell nice I kept using it until my acne got worse and my skin looks awful. I’m not sure if this is actually the real product but real or not, it doesn’t work."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"A burning sensation and it was not easy to peel off. I purchased on the recommendation of a dermatologist. Used it once and that’s it. Also, I didn’t see any evidence of dirt or clogged pores pulled off of my skin. However, I did have to wipe it away instead of peeling it off so that could be the reason. Nonetheless it’s in my cabinet taking up space."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The reviews I read about this product, said there’s a tingle , I felt absolutely nothing. It’s a little unsettling, because I also remember a review that said they purchased this product through amazon and also had no tingle or results. So they purchased it through someone else and the product was totally different, and she did feel the tingle and she also seen results. So I’ll give it a few more try’s and if no results, I will be asking for a refund."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to love this product after reading all the reviews but after using it twice, I tried to return. I was unable to as the seller doesn't offer returns. I followed the directions, leaving it on for ten minutes at a time, no more than twice a week. It really burns so it feels like its working but I didn't experience any peeling or flakiness after. There has been no improvement in using this product and it was really a waste for me. I would not recommend."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've ordered this same product from both ulta and sephora but ordered from amazon for faster delivery.
I' am very familiar with how this product is suppose to feel on the skin, the texture of the liquid and color.
I gave the product I received from amazon the benefit of doubt and waited to see if there are any results and none. I felt absolutely nothing on my skin and no changes."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,Have used before and this isn’t even close to the same product. It was pink water instead of red serum. You are supposed to drop it onto your face and smooth it on but this is literally liquid so it runs right off. I even tried putting it on my fingers with even less luck. Very frustrating and obviously not the real thing. I will go back to ordering from Sephora. It is actually cheaper there.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered this product from amazon and tried it a few times with absolutely no burning or tingling and saw zero results. I read so many great reviews and decided to order it directly from sephora. The consistancy and color are not even the same and the product I got from sephora actually tingles and I have seen some good results.so far. Not sure what product amazon is selling but it is definitely not the same.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I wish I paid more attention to all the reviews on here. There was some sort of disclaimer stating that there is not a plastic seal type thing on the bottle. Perhaps that is why the merchandise arrived looking like the pictures. Live and learn right? This is why it’s best for everyone to order from the actual company, or at least purchase from Ulta and Sephora."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"First time I used it, my skin looked great and glowed. Second time I used it, my skin became angry and broke out like I’ve never ever seen even in my teens.
Now my skin is a mess full of cystic acne. This stuff is strong and will bring everything up to the surface. Not sure if it’s worth it. I stopped using it. Skin is healing. Ugh."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only been using this for about a month and have not been impressed so far.

I have had several break-outs and hope it is simply due to the ""purging process"".

Edit as of 7-22....I just used this again and my face broke out with cystic acne within two days.
Do yourself a favor and try the Generation Clay Ultra Violet Brightening Purple Clay Mask if you want a solid alternative."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,So I raced home on my lunch break because I saw my package had been delivered. I was very excited. Until I opened it. The lid was off not at all sealed and there was solution all over the Box I have pictures if I can figure out how to post them. Not impressed and not even sure I will put on my face
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Many people are complaining about this product
I used it beforehand with no problems and was happy but this particular bottle I don’t know if they changed the formula or what but it burned my skin. Red patch everywhere. Unbearable
Too bad I can’t be refunded . Will not be buying again. Don’t trust it any longer"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t notice any difference in my skin after using this product. I leave it on for no more than 10 minutes and wash it off as directed, but my skin looks exactly the same as before I applied the product.
This does sting upon applying it to my face, but it doesn’t last long.
I just feel like this product really fell flat and didn’t live up to its claims.

Save your money on this one."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,Never seen a GlySal combo dark brown. I’m an esthetician in California and work with many professional AHA BHA peels. This is not good. I also have resilient skin and can take higher than 30% glycolic acid. This really burned. Further on my resilient skin a 30% should not flake or peel. Glycolic penetrates beyond the epidermis to work below. This isn’t a worthy product and they don’t allow you to return. Hmm wonder why.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,My skin is a little sensitive but more dry for the most part and I have some discoloration so I was excited to try out this product. But boy was it a big mistake. I couldn’t even leave it on for 2 mins without it intensely burning. I took it off immediately and it has now left my skin very red and splotchy. My face is burning as I type this. This product isn’t for everyone.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used this product twice and cannot see or feel a difference in my skin. I have used peeling solutions before, usually right after your skin is soft and you can see a difference. I don't know if i recieved a defective bottle or what, but there is no difference between using this or putting water on my face.
Not buying again."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BUY. I used it today and it gave me horrible chemical burn, my face stings and is stained bright red. Directions say to use for no more than 10 minutes, this happened after only 3 minutes of use. Not sure if this is the real product or not but it is a complete waste of money."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,It did nothing for me but make a mess it was the messiest thing I’ve ever experienced it was hard to put on without dripping all over the place when it was on it was dripping all over the place it was a mess and it did nothing for me.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have this for a few weeks now and it does nothing for me. I will continue to use and maybe apply more in my skin. I think this is just one of those products where “individual results may vary.” But if you don’t mind spending $13 bucks, try it. I’m really into skincare and you have to experiment to see what works!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Like others said, this is not the real product. Ordered from both amazon and Sephora, very different. While the amazon one is thicker, dark reddish-brown, nearly scentless, and no stinging/tingling sensation, the Sephora one is more liquid, a brighter red, has a certain smell, and stings. I believe the Sephora one is the genuine product and recommend buying from them instead."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m sorry but this was honestly the worst product so far , I only used it twice and my face broke out
So bad in the next two days... haven’t used it since. My face got clearer but the acne had gotten worse after I brought this product"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don;t know if I just got a bad bottle, but this did nothing for me. Many of the reviews (and a few friends) mentioned a burning sensation if you leave it on too long. I do not have that. I left it on for 15 minutes and nothing...I really just wonder if the bottle is bad for some reason..."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing! I have been using this product for over a week, daily, and have seen nothing. The people writing reviews seem to like it but I have seen no change in any way at all. I will keep using it for another week or so and update my review if there are any changes."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,I would put two stars because my sister said it wasn’t bad on her skin but it was terrible on mine. It burned my skin and left red bumps. It itches and just burned for an hour. I do not recommend if you have sensitive skin.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn’t feel any sensation like burning or tingling. The same peeling solution I purchased from Ulta another day I felt the sensation. And the product I ordered from Amazon, after putting on face it’s feel like I’m putting soap, it’s like white structure."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Used this for 4 weeks straight and wasn't seeing any difference so stopped using it.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this product on here because I thought the one my sister had ran out. Ordered it but, turns out she did still have hers. I compared the two and her box was totally different the real one was more of a matte box and was wider, the smell was completely different as well:/"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have ordered this product from amazon before and the consistency of the peel was thicker, and a darker shade of red. My most recent Bottle is a light red, seems watered down, and there is no sensation on my skin from the acids contained in the peel like there was with other bottles."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know if I had an allergic reaction to this, or if it is normal, but my cheeks got very red and bumpy after using this. I gave it 1 star because I think if you have a reaction to a product there should be a way to return it or get a refund. Unfortunate."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The best face mask ever, IF purchased from the right seller. I don’t know what I received but it wasn’t The Ordinary masks that first tingles, cleans and leaves your pores invisible when you wash it off. The consistency was watery too instead of thick."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldn't leave this on for more than 5 seconds. I used as directed and on contact my skin IMMEDIATELY started burning. Like, unbearable burning. I don't have sensitive skin, either.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product was delivered with a broken seal and a strong scent.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,I used this twice (about one week between uses). Made me break out really badly :( or at least made my closed comedones and pimples much more visible and that was very problematic for me as I am a chronic picker and popper. Big setback. Threw it in the trash.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,It was okay but not what I expected based on the advertisements.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a few Ordinary products from Amazon.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,I love The Ordinary products. They are of excellent quality for a low price. But the problem was that I bought one product and received another! I ordered The Ordinary Peeling Solutions AHA 30% + BHA 2% and received Granactive Retinoid 5% in Squalane. I'm very disappointed because they put a wrong sticker in the product box.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,I ordered as Christmas presents because a friend recommended.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product is amazing! The reason I’m giving it a 1 Star is because you can buy this at Ulta for literally 1/3 of the price. I can’t believe I paid triple the price for the same product!
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is not original, it smells like cheap perfume, it paints your face what the original peeling does not.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I think this is a used product. It wasn’t filled. No seal and when I applied it became like a soapy consistency and was goopy , is that normal ? Plus better to buy directly from site or other retailer. I just don’t trust placing this on my face"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,This price is ridiculous I got the original for way less (this is three times what it actually costs) at a reputable make up and skin care store. It makes no sense to pay this much. Already returned.

It doesn’t sit on your face the same, it stains your fingers, you do not feel like working like you could before. They changed something about this product"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The packaging and product is very similar to the Ordinary brand, but the price is double. It has the frosted eye dropper glass bottle and the wine red colored peeling solution. The solution is supposed to exfoliate and make your skin softer and instruction states to leave on for 10 minutes and nothing longer, then rise with luke warm water afterwards.

This is a chemical peel. The ingredients are alphahydroxy acid (AHA) and beta hydroxy acid (BHA), keyword acid so ALWAYS do a spot test on your skin first and have an acide neutralizer and try to protect your sensitive skin like around the eyes and lips with petroleum jelly like vaseline.

The peel wasn't as strong as the one I have used before. It was slightly tingling but not much. I advise avoiding the sun if possible or making sure to apply sunscreen in the applied areas."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I so truly wanted to love this product (like so truly wanted to love Niacinamide 10% + Zinc, Natural Moisturizing Factors, Resveratrol 3% + FA 3% etc) but seems to be a running theme w TO products.

Tacky sticky texture (WHY?), caused immediate irritation with no visible resurfacing of textural irregularities, made skin flushed and irritated. The whole clear dropper vial + burgundy color is cute if you’re a 15yo girl wanting to feel trendy.

But if you’re looking for true reduction in pore congestion, irregular texture and tone... stay away from this product. Try Paula’s Choice BHA Liquid or dive into DIY skincare.

(Rant: Running theme with Deciem/The Ordinary products... Big ambition, poor execution. Flaunt high %s of active ingredients but don’t house them within a base/delivery system that effectively delivers those actives’ effects to the skin. Not a fan of any of their products. Plus dropper Vials need to go... always buy from a brand that uses airless vacuum pump bottles. Try SkinActives)"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying I had successfully used this product before many times with no problem and great results. However after following recommended application instructions this last time it seemed much more harsh. I didn't leave it on for even half as long as I usually did because it was burning my skin so badly. My face was shiny and red for a couple days after washing it off and painfully dry so I had to constantly moisturize until the damage healed. I still have a small patch under my right eye from it months later. It may just be that I had a bad reaction to it, but to me it's not worth the risk of additional skin damage, so I will be leaving facial peels to the professionals from now on."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,I used this product for the very first time a couple of days ago and at first it stung a little so I thought it was because I had water on my face (even though I dried it well) I left it on for like 8 minutes and washed it off. I followed up with my normal face moisturizer. I have combination skin leaning towards it being more oily. So I use a moisturizer for oily skin. It felt all fine and good but I woke up to a bad breakout like I never had before. I thought it was because I was about to be on my period but nooo this product messed my face up. Will never buy again. It may have worked for other but it ruined my face. Careful.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,I used this without testing it and it gave me a really bad rash. The rash was not visible on plain sight but more like internally. My skin did not peel or have a glossier effect afterwards - not sure what to make of this product.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high expectations for this peel, especially since it was my first TO purchase, but haven't seen any drastic improvements in my sensitive, acne-prone skin over the 4 months that i have been using it. For the first 3 months, I used it twice weekly for 10-15 minutes and now I use it once weekly. My skin tingles while the peel is on my face, but it is bearable. Blackheads are still there after I neutralize the peel with warm water, and I haven't noticed lightening of areas with hyperpigmentation nor increased healing of or prevention of acne. I haven't experienced any peeling or dryness. However, my skin does feel smoother after using. I will not repurchase, and will try another brand's peel once I finish this bottle."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the one on the left from Amazon and then I went to Ulta and purchased the same item the one on the right. I read the reviews and was expecting to feel something from the peeling solution. When I tried the purchase from Amazon I did not feel any tingling or notice any real effect on my face. The consistency and color is the same however, when I used the bottle from Ulta I felt the tingle and notice a difference in the am. Im not sure what is going on with the Amazon purchase as I am not a chemist."

(i also found it left my skin dry n had a weird smell idk if thats how it always smells but its just like a really sour berry kind of smell)"

Next day no results. Second day left it on ten minutes. No tingling, next day, no effect. Third day, 20 minutes. Next day nothing. It has been four days since last (20 minute) application. I can;t see any difference.
I gave it two stars because the packaging, branding is very appealing and because it only cost $14.00.
I would be REALLY mad if I had thrown away $60 or $70 or $80. So disappointed"

Still, I don’t know how anyone can stand having this on their skin for longer than 10 seconds. I just can’t, I’ve tried and failed every time.

I’m pleased others can tolerate it though; because the benefits I’ve seen are incredible. It’s not the product’s fault; it’s my skin."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly haven't noticed a difference. The burn is minimal, if noticeable at all. Anything that promises you results only after using it for several weeks is something I would typically suspect. Since this is an at home chemical peel that is supposed to exfoliate and advertises itself as a particularly intense one - I'd expect /something/ after 1-3 uses. I even ignored the warnings and used it every day for a week, hoping it'd do something but no."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,I have oily skin - it's not sensitive - yet this stuff ruined my skin! It made it peel and itch around the mouth/chin area. At first I thought that it was from the retinol so I stopped using that but it kept happening and the day after I had used it. Be careful around your eyes and your mouth ladies!
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I always test new cosmetic treatments by using them only on one half of my face, because my complexion goes through cycles regardless of which treatments I'm using and I can't always be sure that changes are due to the product. After six and a half weeks of twice-weekly use, nobody could guess which side it was. My teen used it too and thought maybe it helped her. On the positive side, it didn't hurt and did no damage."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I came across this in a Buzzfeed article. I've been learning how to take care of my combination skin using more chemical exfoliates rather than abrasive because my skin scars unfortunately well. While this product felt like it was working the first two times (a gentle burning sensation) I haven't really noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. However, I've only been using it about two or three months, twice a week, and not totally consistently."

It’s a shame I had high hopes for this product. 2 stars for scent of the product."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Personally, you have to know how to use this product, it's more for normal skin, but for sensitive and atopic skin like mine it's not the best."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,This product burned the heck out of my face. I only tried it on a small area but it created a red rash that took a week to heal so I knew it would have really made a mess on my whole face so glad I didn't try that. I think my skin is too light and sensitive for this product as I read good reviews on it before buying.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know if I have tolerant skin or what, but I didn't feel any of the tingling or stinging others warn about. After three weeks and using it twice a week I can't say I've seen any results either. I even tried 12 and 15 minutes the last two times instead of just the 10.

I was okay when I initially used this product. However, after long term use of this peel, my skin started reacting very BADLY! The areas I applied the product became very red and inflamed. I had very bad contact dermatitis that lasted for 5 months and doctors told me it almost looked like a chemical burn. I had to do a complete purge of all my skincare products because the bad dermatitis this product gave me wouldnt heal. If you are new to this product, I would just apply it to a small area of your skin and just do a patch test. Everyones skin is different, and Im just the one who reacts terribly to this product."

Tried it for a few weeks, my skin was softer right after, but I have yet to see any difference with pigment changes, or fine line/scars ect, in reality I feel like I'm seeing brown pigment more than when I started, plus my skin is breaking out with little bumps mainly around the jaw line, and then my skin is very dry and flaky around my temples.
Maybe if I had major acne scarring I would see a difference, so it may work better for others who have more problematic skin."

The pimples appeared the day after I used the mask and they appeared in odd places, like around my eyebrows or in places I normally never get pimples. I also got a few cystic pimples too and I almost NEVER get those. I don't think this is any kind of purging since I'm not new to exfoliation and exfoliate regularly.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was extremely excited to use this product as the reviews were great. There was supposed to be NO burning or irritation but the second I put this product on it became unbearable. I thought it burned because it was a new product but after doing lots of research you should've felt no burning. I found that the areas on my face where I felt few to no burning occurring were the following... My nose and chin. The areas where some burning occurred were the following... My forehead and left cheek. And lastly, the areas where lots of burning occurred were the following...My right cheek. As I was inspecting my face I started seeing where the places it burned the most there were pimples and/or scratches. As the bottle reads it says to NOT use on broken skin which in those areas my skin was broken. When I used it yesterday the pain was terrible and I couldn't keep this product on for longer than 1 minute. But this morning when I used it I did small amounts and applied it with my finger. The burning lasted only a few seconds then went away. I keep it on for 5 minutes instead of 10 because I feel as if 10 is a bit accesive. The burning never lasted when I took the product of my face was just red but no further burning. My overall opinion is this seems like it works for many people but for some not so well. It looks like many people have different experiences with this product but mostly they are good so I do recommend this product just not for people with sensitive skin also only keep on for about 5 minutes and apply on places that do not a lot of breakages. As I wish my experience was better I now know that ""The ordinary peeling solution"" Is not right for my skin but maybe yours. If irritation occurs I suggest you try to understand why and if it continues then discontinue use. I am no dermatologist but I believe I have some good feedback for you. Hope you found this helpful have a nice day and stay safe."

This product was hyped up so I gave it a try because I love lots of other products from this brand and it’s so affordable it’s amazing. However, I determined my skin is way too sensitive for this treatment. I attempted it twice to be sure I was using it right and it irritated my skin so much it hurt (bad redness & stinging sensation). I’ve never had that type of reaction with a skincare product.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m not new to chemical peels. I use them occasionally. My skin is oily but still sensitive as I have eczema. I have a lot of very large clogged pores and the appearance of textured skin. I also have uneven skin tone from poor blood circulation (lots of redness) which makes my skin look dull. As for texture/ occasional breakouts from eczema this did absolutely nothing. In terms of brightening my skin tone and giving me better blood circulation, this was a very quick fix! Sad it didn’t do much for large pores and textured skin on my part, but did offer a quicker method for exfoliating/ brightening/ evening my skin tone. So if you’re a little more experienced with chemical peels you might need to try something stronger but if you’re only looking for smaller fixes, this product is great to use if you need a quick fix. Note: it did tingle/ burn within first minute of application but it felt more of an itch for me. But as I mentioned this isn’t my very first chemical peel so it wasn’t the worst I’ve experienced. This is great for those using a chemical peel for the first time :)"

This product worked great, but I haven’t seen many people showing what could happen either. I don’t have sensitive skin and I don’t over exfoliate. I left the peel on for five minutes because it was my first time and it HURT. My skin looked awful the day after the peel and I had to take extra care of my chin area to avoid hyperpigmentation.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only used this once so far. I'll come back and give a better review later. I have very oily skin and lots of sebum and dry patches. All the reviews I read for this product (oily skin) were good so I thought I would try it...I do love the Ordinary! You can leave it on 2-10 min max. I did not feel any tingling while it was on and wore for the full 10 min. While I was rinsing it off with the directed lukewarm water, that's when it stung a tiny bit but not awful. The patch of dry skin around my chin was gone but there was still more texture than I was hoping for. I'm not giving up though, I'm sure it takes more than once to show better results."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My skin is sensitive and somewhat reactive. It is a product with which you have to be very careful, if I think it can help with the appearance of pores and very important that the skin is well, that is, does not have dryness patches, any kind of irritation and of course do not apply with any active product either before or after at least two days.
I had a small dryness patch and apply the product for 8 minutes, the skin in that area became irritated, I had to apply desonide and/or castor oil.I
do not think I will buy the product again, I will try it on the feet since there the skin is much stronger. I'll go on with my mechanical scrubs."

Everyone said it made their skin super soft. I have extremely dry skin that gets rough after a couple days. The first time I tried it, I followed the directions to a T. I washed my face, made sure it was dry, didn't leave it on more then 10 minutes, etc. My skin felt slightly smoother but nothing great. Second time I used it, I exfoliated with a facial scrub and left on for a little more than 10 minutes. Got better results that time but still not as smooth as I expected. I don't know if it gets better the more you use it or if my skin is just too rough and I'm expecting too much from this product."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reading the reviews and ingredients and doing my research, I felt that this product would be great. Upon receipt, it was just as described and a good portion of product. I read the directions and used as stated (the smell is pleasant, but the product is quite runny, very watery). I applied it, left it on for 10-15 mins and washed off; there was skin tightening after my face dried (nothing painful nor unpleasant). The tightness gave the assumption that something was happening, however, after using for a month and some weeks, I saw no visible change to my skin. It may be that I need to use the product longer, but I was unimpressed."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the product. I have moderate eczema and was able to use this without any flare ups, which is nearly miraculous. You’ll definitely see results in regard to brightening and smoothness of skin, even after the first usage. That being said, I was a little annoyed at myself for not just getting it from Sephora, considering it was literally twice(and then some) the cost here. $7.95 vs. $16.
The price gauging is why this product is getting three stars. Will not be buying from this particular seller again."

This wasn’t for me clearly because the first day I applied it..it kinda stung (nothing I couldn’t handle) and when I removed it and put moisturizer I was glowing but I NEVER PEELED! I’ve tried it several times after .. even left it on for 15 minutes and still no peeling. I’m considering using this on a wet face because that may be the only way I’d get a result??

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly I don’t see the hype over this product. It made my skin worse. This product can be dangerous, my friend got chemical burns from it and if you use it and don’t use sunscreen you can ruin your skin. Not to mention it burns when you use it. In my case it made me breakout 2 days after using it. Personally I wouldn’t recommend this and it’s not really worth the money. It leaves your skin looking great!... for two days."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,My skin has some pretty big pores in the TZone and one of this product and it's promoter's claims is that it helps reduce the look of these pores. After using it every other day for a month I have not noticed any difference in my skin's texture or the size of the pores. My skin does feel refreshed and moisturized as heck after and I feel like a total badass warrior maiden painting my face in the blood of my enemies while applying it which is pretty great.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,After reading all the reviews I expected stinging and glowing skin. I got neither sadly. I’ve used AHAs before and have always experienced the stinging. My concern is that I received my package at 8:30pm so that means it was sitting on a UPS truck all day at 150 degrees and I’m not sure how heat affects the product. When I received the package everything is in was extremely hot. I would buy again maybe to make sure that maybe the product was ruined in transit.

One of the best things I have put on my face. Results after the first use! Please follow the directions exactly, and if you have sensitive skin maybe shorten the time.

UPDATE:

Although I still feel like this product is amazing I find that it works the best the first few times it is used and then it seems to lose most efficacy. I don’t know why this is exactly but it doesn’t do much for my skin after, let’s say, 5 times of use."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It works but not as well as I expected. I didn't find that it burned that bad. The first time I used it my skin peeled a little the next day, nothing crazy. After that it didn't peel anymore. It gave my skin a nice glow the day after then it looked a little dry the days following. I felt I had to used a lot of product to counter the effects which made me unhappy."

I've used this product for a few months now - about once a week. It feels really good to put on, slight sting, and it looks cool too!

However, I'm not sure that I'm really seeing much results. I bought this to combat my closed comedones because of the cell turnover. I might try something that has a higher BHA content."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately I can't say much since I only use it once and that's because my skin didn't react well to the product. Well, it turns out that my skin is sensitive and I didn't know it, so it's NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN.

If you order it from here, you will never be certain your product is the real deal and some amazon sellers double the price for a product that may be real or fake.

Definitely one of the most unique masks I’ve worn, but also I am unsure how to feel about it because of the stinging feeling when you put it on. I only left it on for under 10mins as directed, but it was stinging and rather itchy, even when I washed it off. The second time I used the mask however, I steamed my face beforehand, and it was a lot less uncomfortable especially when washed off, but it still stung. I put moisturizer on immediately after and my face felt soft after. I would recommend steaming your face before using this mask to open your pores. I will try using this more to provide more updates, but for now 3/5."

I could be purging though since it's an acid but I stopped using because I could get the same desired results from other serums."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, so I wasn't so sure about this. I felt it was all burn, not much reward. Some people have commented that it does not burn and in most cases that would be true but I always do a very aggressive microdermabrasion first before so it did burn quite a bit. But after, I never saw my skin crack up and peel any so I wasn't sure what was going on. But after about 4 days when I was applying my daily face regimen there was small amounts of skin I finally saw coming off. It was little clumps I was noticing in my creams. At first I thought maybe I had dried up food on my face somewhere but then I remembered I had done this a few days prior. It wasn't a life changing kinda product and the burn was nothing like a TCA peel. But there was also zero recovery time. You never see the skin peel. And honestly, I don't even know if I would have even had that amount of skin peeling without the microdermabrasion first. So I would highly recommend some kinda exfoliater if you don't have a MD tool at home. So you can truly maximize this product. Its a very light weight acid and i tried a patch peice on my hand and didn't feel any burn. So I imagine you wouldn't feel it on your face if you just put it on with the exfoliating first. But when I use acid, I want to feel the burn or else whats the point. This is a good solution if you want a light weight acid peel without a burning sensation. But don't expect huge results. You won't frost or peel significantly enough to combat weinkles and dark spots. It basically will speed up some skin shedding but it doesn't get deep enough for AMAZING results. I think it would be a good option though for summer time because you don't want to do a TCA peel during summer. I like it, it's not a 5 star product, but I think combined with other treatments you can achieve some results that can help."

Shame on me for not actually looking around. I am usually good about this, but failed here. I read some great reviews and just hit Amazon, the price seemed good for what this is reported to do, so I ordered. Don't get me wrong even with the almost triple mark up, it is a great product.

I didn't get the miracle results minutes after use that many report. After rinsing I did notice skin was more ""slippery"" and smooth. It was nice, but not any different than a mud mask. It felt better but looked no different. A couple days later my skin began to peel and I noticed it was looking much better, and now I can fully recommend. I just did my second mask and have high hopes. My background is oily t zone, rough complexion, with anti aging goals.

I hit some sort of mid life crisis (I am 51) several months ago and started experimenting with skin care (pretty much did nothing before). Next to micro needling and retin A, this really makes the cut as a winner (Yes I use sun screen, but you don't notice the effects even though it is most important). I have 1/2 dozen other things that are meh."

I only took away a star because it is twice as expensive on Amazon, than at the store.
I have had mild peels in the past, some at home, some at a dermatologist office. The ones at home produced more irritation than results and I had given up on trying to find the right one for my fair, reactive skin.
I used the Ordinary 30% AHA 2% BHA peel the first evening I got it. The stinging only lasted a few seconds. Left it on for 10 minutes. The color did not bother me but it may bother others. After washing it off, all the little flakes and dullness have disappeared. I mean VISIBLY smoother, more glowing skin, no irritation. I did put on really rich night cream after and voila! Almost a week later my skin still feels incredibly smooth and looks fresh and glowing.
For the record, not a paid review or getting anything as part of a promotion. Just the best peel ever."

That said*, very effecacious product from TO, Deciem at a crazy-reasonable pricepoint ! May make those newer to skin care, tingle toward the end of the 10 mins. DO exercise caution folks and do NOT go over the 10 mins.!!! Having an acid burn can take weeks to months to heal peeps, let alone dual* acid burns; your face is your builboard after all.
This stuff is proof, once again, that your skin does not have to visibly peel to be exfoliated well. Use it when staying in that night; face will be pink from the peel & naked face time may well be needed for the night/overnight.
Do not use the night before homecoming, prom, job interviews, going to a physician, hot date, or if you intend upon sun exposure the next day; an expert says this (I used this accordingly too). Do not apply any acids afterwards and gents, no shaving for you that night, kind of...or else ( youll have very angry skin not suitable for viewing by anyone).

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the bottle poorly tightened with the dropper being oddly angled. Some of the product leaked onto out and the box it came in was beaten up and damaged.

The actual product is pretty syrupy and and a deep red. Doesn’t smell to bad or great. I will tell you THIS STUFF BURNS! I had no adverse reaction other then the burning which I had to endure for the 10 minutes the bottle recommends. After washing it off my skin still had a slight burn to it which wore off after a few minutes.

I could only assume that it was the product doing its job because my skin wasn’t rashy or inflamed afterwards. In fact I was left with smooth and fresh skin after the initial tingly/burning sensation wore off. Skin remained sensitive for the rest of the day and I couldn’t use moisturizer or anything immediately after. I did spray an aloe vera facial spray to soothe my skin.

I only used it once so far as the maximum recommended use is twice a week, but I will update after a few more uses."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"12/18
First time using this peeling solution and purchased it based on reviews here. Very happy with this product! The directions on the box are very clear - it's a 10 minute peel and they emphasize not leaving it on longer than that. The solution is cherry red and somewhat runny - which is why I gave only 4 stars. It's easy enough (but a bit drippy) to apply on fingers then to face. As the directions say it's meant to be used as a masque and then removed. I immediately felt the product working on my skin. My skin isn't that sensitive so left it on the full 10 minutes. For those with more sensitive skin maybe less time would be best to start with or try a patch test as written in the directions. My skin was so soft and smooth afterwards as if I'd had a facial.
The directions say you shouldn't use this more than twice a week - and because it contains an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) and a beta hydroxy acid (BHA) - sunscreen is NECESSARY in your daily facial routine.
The bottle will last a very long time and I will definitely keep using it."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a chemical peel, but not a very strong one unless you leave it on your skin for longer than it says. This pill is very comfortable, and does what it has to do. It makes my skin super soft and radiant! I use it once a week, I leave it on for two minutes over what it says, so I leave it on for 12 minutes. And I leave it on for that time because I have the tolerance for it. After two complete months of using it on a regular basis once a week I really do see a difference. I’ve also purchased this from Ulta after I purchased it from Amazon just because it was out of stock when I needed it from Amazon. It’s a darn good buy."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"People mustve received an old bottle because mine looks exactly like the product if you were to buy it at a sephora or ulta. The tingling sensation is definitely there and builds as you leave it on longer. I definitely see a difference as far as my pores getting smaller and my skin being more hydrated. I also started using organic cold pressed virgin rosehip oil after rinsing off the chemical peel mask...with the being said, I have not peeled like I thought would happen. Could be due to the rosehip oil hydrating my face which I use everyday while only doing the mask 2x a week as directed. This is only the first full week of using it so will update as time goes along but so far so good."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m so confused on if I like this product or not. I can clearly see it helping my sun spots and “mothers marks” but every time I use it, I wake up the next day with the worst cystic acne all around my nose and inner cheek area. By the time it clears up its time to use it again and it happened again where I woke up with terrible bumps. I did this 3 times over the course of 6 weeks and am terrified to keep going but others have said this is a “purge” I truly hope that is the case because the texture of my skin is improving with each use.

P.s. don’t use this more than twice a week if even that."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,My 14 year old daughter talked me into trying this. We both love the way it makes our faces feel and look. We constantly fight over it so I recommend buying 2 if you have a teenager!
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"30% AHA! 2% BHA. I mean that's more than enough. Definitely a quality product, I mean yah its a bit much in the beginning so go easy on application and limit to once a week. This is by no means a solution to a problem for acne. It is basically for people who want a nice acid exfoliant much like how most people exfoliate with a scrub once a week or so. However, unlike a scrub this introduces some great acids meant for rejuvenating toning and turning over the skin. AND the color is purely so you can see what's going on when you're applying it."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Omg AMAZING!!! I had naively tried a high concentration TCA peel and burned small pick scars into my face in 2015. This solution has buffed them out and made them *MUCH* less visible. I kid you not enough to not want to cry anymore about it. I am in my 3rd treatment week in and I’m so confident in this product, counterfeit or not, that I’m applying it on other scars. This has also been working on a burn scar of a similar age.

Great news for anyone looking for balancing out complexion for burn, chemical, and acne scars. ;)

Good luck folks!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well it does help but I bought it for my armpit cause it’s all black for no reason it kinda getting whiter I used it on my face likes it’s supposed to be used but it kinda burned but overall it made my skin feel so fresh so I would definitely recommend ( maybe not for sensitive skin) pretty much 10/10
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff rocks if your face can handle it. The product arrived as advertised and was an authentic product. I had too many breakouts and irritation after using, but I have had similar reactions when using active AHA’s and BHA products. This is not a reflection of this product but more my individual skin conditions. I have started to use this product on my back and butt-it works great there. Also you can use this on your feet (similar to like the baby foot type peel masks that are so popular now days). I recommend if you have experience with AHA’s and other acids."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical about this peel and after some of the online reviews, scared. However, as a novice to skincare and never used a peel before, I can tell you with confidence, don't be scared! Follow the directions and you will be fine. I loved my skin about 3 days after applying the syrum. At first I thought it wasn't doing anything, but then I started feeling the softness in my skin. I can't wait to see how continued use of this product further helps my late-30s skin."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This product really helped my acne by exfoliating my face and getting ride of small bumps on my forehead that seamed to be resilient to other products. I do feel like it could be a little stronger though. Its a little itchy while its on my face but thats how i know its working. My face will be a little red on my cheeks after but only for about an hour. Doesnt cause flaking or drying. I have combination skin, mostly dry but i get oily in t zone."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using this once a week for a few months now, and no changes in regards to acne/blackheads/sebaceous filaments all of which I suffer from but no negative consequences either. It does, however, exfoliate really well. My skin is very oily and flakey on and around the nose but if I apply this for 10 minutes it's buttery smooth for a few days after."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is my holy Grail to deal with hormonal acne. I apply it right at the beginning and just after the end of my period and it keeps my skin clear. It's much better to use this as a preventative treatment rather than do spot treatment. They don't recommend this for inexperienced acid users but I naughtily ignore that. Just build up to using it for the ten minutes (I started from 5 and did one minute increments) and patch test.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have hyperpigmentation in my mature skin. Also now noticeable fine lines. I was looking for an effective, safe and affordable home peel. This is a great one!
The application simple with my fingers. Instructions easy to follow.

I have used it 2 times in 1 week. The following day I did at home derma-plane. The improvement is apparent. I feel encouraged to continue using The Ordinary products daily and the peel weekly as the appearance and texture improve."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fine but doesn’t do miracles. After healing from cystic acne I’m always looking for something to help with my hyper pigmentation. Made my skin feel soft and did not irritate it but did very little to help with discoloration. If you regularly chemically exfoliate your face- do not expect out of this world results from this. Bought this as a Skincare By Hyram recommendation.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually buy this from Sephora, but they were out of stock for quite some time so I got it here. I gave it 4 stars instead of five because you can get this item at Sephore for $8. So the seller here is trying to make a quick buck. You can even buy it from the The Ordinary's website for cheaper than what this seller charges here on Amazon. JUST saying.

Product has always worked amazing for me. No issues there."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have not been good about using this twice a week but have used it about 4 times in the past month. It does sting a little but not too bad. Afterwards it sometimes stings a little still and I put the Ordinary 100% plant derived squalane serum on my face and it feels great. I haven’t noticed a huge difference but I like how soft and clean my skin feels afterwards. Would probably notice more of a difference if I could be better about using it!
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The peeling solution comes in a small dropper bottle, which makes it fun to dispense the red colored peel on you face. I did a wrist test before using on my face, and leave the peel on for 5 minutes before washing and moisturizing my skin. Peel tingles, but not painful.

After using once a week for three week, my winter skin does look brightened. Using a combo of this peel and DRMTLGY microabrasion exfoliating scrub has treated and removed small bumps on my forehead near my hairline. Great product and price"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve used this product one time, for five minutes. I have so far noticed my skin seems more glowy and smooth, and will continue using/updating my review as time goes on! I noticed many reviews trying to say this is a fake product because of color differences and figured I’d throw this in in case anyone was apprehensive to buy it because of those other reviews. This product changes colors because of the Tasmanian pepperberry they use in it. It changes color depending on season."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this thinking it was fairly priced but it turns out you can by it direct from The Ordinary for $7.20 and shipping is free for orders over $25. The product is way worth buying, it leaves your skin soft and minimizes your pores. I don't recommend leaving it on the full 10 mins to start with though in case your skin is sensitive."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"First, I have to say this is great for starling your roommates, as you will look like you did a DIY vampire facial. BUT it is fantastic! Extremely easy to apply and remove and it made my skin look so even and soft. However, you need to make note of the warning label- this product makes you more susceptible to sunburn. So get yourself a good moisturizer with SPF in it!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Definitely stings when you put it on, but it exfoliates super well. My skin feels so good and soft after every use. Do only use it twice a week (keep the days you use it spread out) because it stings a LOT more if you use it frequently. Helps my acne scars heal faster which is super great!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lol I made the mistake of shaving before I used this product and it was super uncomfy haha but overall, I like how exfoliating this is and how it leaves my skin softer the next day.

I’m sure it will work great, it’s just as soon as a put it on a burner quite a bit. It eventually calmed down to more of a tingle.maybe it’s just my skin type lol"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the way this product makes my skin glow. It looks like I had a peel done but no down time which is nice when your constantly on the go. The only down side, it arrived with the lid off and leaked all over the box. So it didn't arrive a full bottle :("
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,It definitely did work like it lightened dark spots but I personally needed a stronger percentage.

I still use it, but leave it on for 5 min."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,it works well at gently exfoliating and i really like it. it hasnt caused me any irritation at all. only downside is that it stains dry patches and pimples red which makes them look worse before they get better.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It just works. Not much I can say. Gets rid if dead skin effectively, just be sure to follow the directions as written to avoid problems. The first couple of times you use the peel you may feel a really weird itching (I know I did) but after the third or fourth session you barely notice."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,This stuff is amazing! Every week I look forward to using this exfoliating mask because I know how much it will help my skin! I have super sensitive skin and this doesn’t irritate it at all! I’ve noticed my hyperpigmentation starting to lighten and my face looks healthier. I still get a few pimples but I think that’s from my poor diet.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I applied the product it itched right away, probably for 2 minutes. I do have sensitive skin so maybe that’s why. Once I washed it off my skin was super soft."

Will update after bottle is empty!
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Some facial peels can really give you a burning sensation. For me this product has the right level of strength. I use it once a week and I can see the difference.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"For me, using this product was always a debate. Personally, this product with burn/almost itch when I had it on my face. Though, now that my skincare routine is a bit better, i feel like the pain died down and it’s easier to use. I also see the skin becoming softer/lighter in terms of scarring."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I purchased this product I read several reviews first, so i thought I would feel a lot more tingling or reaction on my face.

Never, never put it on a wet face!!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,This will not wear your skin down or overwork sensitive skin.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,This product definitely gives your skin a type of glow but it's the sort of shine that you can get with most decent products. I haven't noticed any life-changing results but I still liked it. I leave mine on for way longer than 10 minutes because my skin is the kind that needs to be nearly abused in order to look good.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,I first came across the product through YouTube and decided to try it out and see if it gets rid of hyperpigmentation cause by acne . I've been using it for four weeks now and have been told by others that my face is looking more clearer. I'm strongly thinking of buying another.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Improved the quality of my skin but hasn't had a noticeable affect on blackheads which is why I bought it.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Makes your skin soft and look a little more supple.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I've been doing facial peels for many years at home. Originally I would see my dermatologist about every other month and she would do them. Over time, I developed a long standing relationship with her, became a pharmaceutical rep and she gracefully and kindly ""taught me the ropes"" for performing the peels at home and at my own risk.

With that being said, I've used glycolic peels, TCA peels, natural peels, you name it, I've tried it. This peel by ORDINARY is something all together different in terms of results, process of application, and time. I received my bottle within two days and it was packaged well. I read the directions and proceeded to wash my face with Cetaphil for sensitive skin. I rinsed my face several times using warm to hot water and then a cool water rinse. I patted dry and waited for about 5 minutes before applying the ORDINARY peel. You never want to use a peel when your skin is wet or damp.

Once ready to apply, I used the dropper to suck some product up into the tube and then began lightly squeezing the dropper on my forehead, cheeks, chin and nose. Oddly enough, it does not really drip off your face. I'd say it's a bit thicker than a serum, but obviously thinner than a lotion. Once I thought I had enough product on my face using the dropper, I then spread the product around using a light touch with my fingertips.

After my face was covered completely (and kinda scary looking as it looks like blood), I then set the timer for 12 minutes. The directions say not to leave on the skin for longer than TEN minutes, but I know my skin and I know what it can handle and what it takes for a product such as this to work effectively. During the time the product was on my skin, somewhere around the 7 minute mark, I began to feel a slight tingling and burning sensation, somewhat like a sunburn, but definitely very tolerable. This means that the product is working and performing as it should. Yeah!

After my time was up, I rinsed my face for a good 5 minutes using cool water and making sure to not leave any product residue behind. I then patted dry very lightly and examined my skin in a high powered mirror. I was able to see areas of my skin where I've had previous issues of acne and slight wrinkles really respond to the peel. Yeah, again! I'm happy about this because this does not always happen with other peels. Seeing a response to the product means the product is really WORKING.

I waited about another 5 minutes after patting dry and applied a light moisturizer, Boots No7 Protect and Perfect Intense Advanced Serum, which is sort of part serum, part light lotion and excellent for sensitive skin. About an hour later I again examined my skin and found it to be glowing, a bit pink, soft and even textured. I have JUST FOUND MY NEW BEST FRIEND.

Not even considering price (which by the way is excellent), this will be my once a week go-to peel. It's not messy, it takes hardly any time to do and the results are fantastic. I'd recommend this to friends and others looking for an easy addition to their skin care routine, especially one that visible results are clear. At this time, I have no active acne breakouts, but I've had them on occasion in the recent past, perhaps a couple times a year I'll get one or two pimples. I think using this product regularly will prevent that from happening. I'm thrilled with my experience of the ORDINARY peel!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm 25 with combination, acne prone skin, and very sensitive. I have some fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes, (though I don't use it there) large pores and milia on the sides of my face. This stuff has helped with everything! After using it, my pores look so much cleaner and my skin looks and feels so smooth. My milia, which I haven't been able to get rid of in about a year, is almost completely gone, and the fine lines on my forehead seem much less visable. I'm not sure if this directly helps with fine lines, but it may have just improved the texture overall, so they aren't as noticeable. I was suffering from cystic acne on my chin and haven't had any harsh breakouts since I've been using this. I still get small breakouts occasionally, but its definitely improved from what it was.

Before I purchased this, I watched a few review videos on youtube, and decided to buy it. In one of the videos, a girl mentioned that you probably don't need to apply too much, so I decided to take her advice and only apply a thin layer. Like her, I didn't see any crazy, immediate results, but it did make my skin a bit softer and my pores appeared a little smaller. The burning sensation was pretty bad for the first 2-3 minutes, but not intolerable, so I decided to power through it. (In no way am I recommending this. Everyones skin is different) After a few minutes, it stopped burning completely, so I was able to leave it on for the full 10 minutes. I have pretty sensitive skin, and the burning felt like it does on my scalp when I've bleached my hair in the past.
The second time I used it, I applied a lot more to where it looked almost like the color it does in the bottle. The irritation was still a little harsh, but not as bad as the first time. I assume it was because my skin was already a little used to it. This time I saw much better results immediately! After this, I decided to start using a thick layer each time and the results have been amazing! Now that I'm realizing how much product I'm using, I'm taking it back a little and applying a thin layer again and still seeing great results.
I'm glad I watched videos and took the approach I did, because it allowed me to test it out to see how much my skin can handle and get used to it. Now, it doesn't burn too much, its more of just an itchy, tingling sensation, but I wouldn't recommend using it when your skin is very dry, cracked, or broken. If you do have dry skin, apply it immediately after you've rinsed your face so there's still a little moisture and avoid any areas where your skin is broken.

I only use it once a week, and although it says it should be used as a replacement of an exfoliant, I use a regular scrub at the end of the week, because my skin can get a little flaky, and I figure its safe enough if I'm only using the peel once a week instead of twice."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t think I’ve ever used a skincare product that gave such impressive results so quickly. I used this stuff once and my skin was softer than it had ever been in my life, and I saw a huge visible difference. I now use it twice a week and my skin is incredibly soft and smooth (I had no idea how rough it was before). My pores are visibly smaller and it really rejuvenates my skin each time. There’s also a TON of applications in this bottle. I mean I use a few drops to cover my whole face, and that’s it. It’s a fantastic value for what you are getting, even if you buy it on Amazon where it’s way more expensive than directly from them.

This can be used by anybody, regardless of your skincare routine. Just put it on your face and wash it off 10 mins later, and enjoy your insanely smooth and soft face. I do it in the evening and follow with an overnight moisturizing mask, but you can just use your regular moisturizer.

This product alone made me start using The Ordinary products for everything because of how blown away I was that some weird red liquid made my face feel so good.

**UPDATE**

After using this product regularly for a couple of months, I went two weeks without using it, and I can confirm there is a huge difference between using this product and not using it. My face went back to being rough and feeling like it needed to constantly be exfoliated, and my pores got larger again. I also had some cystic acne that I was used to before I started using the peel every week. It was a nice reminder that this stuff actually does work wonders, and I'm not crazy.

Also, I noticed that it helped a ton in evening out my skin tone. I have some uneven pigmentation on my forehead from years of working in the sun, and as I've gotten older I've noticed that when summer rolls around and I start to pick up a tan, it really shows. This peeling solution really evened out those areas, and they're not nearly as noticeable as before. I think they would be gone within a year if I used this peel weekly."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I did cosmetic dermatology in California for a few years and still do derm from time to time. I've seen what I can do in an office. This peel is the best peel I've run across. I do use a dermal pen. I use retinol as well but.... The biggest most dramatic change came from this peel. I use it twice a week. After I use Elta MD moisture seal with a half a scoop of cosmetica vit C powder. I've seen about 5 years come off my face in the last month. Given it takes 3 to 6 months to see changes I'm very excited about the future and seeing the changes. While watching the news I would randomly ask Alexa how old someone is. At 52 my skin is better than people in late 30s and early 40s. I still have laxity of age but the skin I have has improved so much with this peel. I wish I didn't have to wear a mask at work because the nurses always ask my advice about skin care and I can't show them how great it's looking. I'm looking at my skin and scars at 40x magnification. These changes are real! Do yourself a favor and get this peel!
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First time user here so I probably shouldn’t be writing a review but I’m so impressed and 1 AM and I can’t tell anyone how amazing this is at the moment so here it goes.

Used as the directions said, cleanse face and allow face to dry...the way that was worded was odd so i did that exactly, I let my face air dry and then slathered it on my face and neck. I immediately started feeling a burning sensation on some parts of my cheeks and around my nose area (it wasn’t an aggressive burn though, like it was bearable, i wasn’t in tears or anything and didn’t leave me with burns on my face). I rinsed with luke warm water but more on the cool side, patted my face dry with a clean towel and immediately slathered fresh aloe vera gel on my face to help calm down the irritation, i let that sit on my face for a little and once it dried i also rinsed that off, kind of like a second mask but just to soothe and then i applied a facial oil, i use Squalane!

and my face is GLOWING, RADIANT and SO smoothe! i’m super pleased with my skin right now!! so i definitely see a difference in texture for my first impression

as for dark marks and discoloration, i can’t make a note of that only because that would take a few sessions to really notice a difference but i have a slight discoloration forming around my mouth area that does look more even with my skin tone now! but it wasn’t crazy dark beforehand either but yeah i will continue to use this and recommend it to everyone i know :)"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve only used this product twice, but the way my skin looks after is amazing! A little drying, but honestly that’s to be expected and is mentioned on packaging. Didn’t irritate my skin whatsoever, and will definitely keep using in my rotation!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was using this product consistently for a month. I started at 2x a week, and reduced this to 1x a week. This has been the only product that I've used which worked to lighten hyperpigmentation scars along my jawline and chin area. I suffer from PCOS, and therefore developed scarring over the years, post facial hair removal. This immediately started lightening the scars/dark patches. DO NOT use other exfoliating products with this such as: cleansers with exfoliating beads, exfoliating sponges, or handheld electronic facial exfoliators. Also, I would not use this product within 24-48 hours of using hair removal techniques; rather they be creams or razors. This is what halted my use, after I burned the skin in my smile creases above my lip, after I'd previously *lightly* shaved my moustache (using an eyebrow archer style razor). My skin blistered, and was very irritated. I also burned the area around my hairline, which I'd previously been rubbing. Therefore, take care to ensure you've not rubbed, shaved, or been too abrasive with your skin care routine prior to using this. I would consider my issues user errors, and found the product worked wonders for what I purchased it for: removal of hyperpigmentation along my jawline. I treated the new skin issues IMMEDIATELY with organic ivory shea butter, and they've already resolved, and left no additional scarring. Other than these warnings, I absolutely love this product!! Will be resuming use soon, and continuing to lighten my jawline. With very careful use, this product is sure to help, and I hope this review does also."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,This peel by the ordinary is awesome Once a week on face for 10 minutes does wonders for my skin... My skin is more glowing and clear for such a great price. Give it a try and you won't be sorry
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m super embarrassed to share these pictures, but this product is too good not to share the results!

I have had cystic acne on my face since I was 13. Hormonal changes tended to cause the worst flare ups, but overall I was constantly breaking out. I wore makeup pretty much 24/7 trying to hide it which only made matters worse...

After using this product for 3 months I have now stopped wearing makeup entirely. I am in awe of how healthy my skin looks and feels! My overall complexion has changed dramatically, my pores are significantly smaller and my skin feels so soft!

I used the peel about 2-3 times a week to start. It did sting quite a bit the first few times I used it but it was bearable and never left any major irritation behind. After the first month, I started using it once a week and now I use it about every two weeks and have also started using the face moisturizer and under eye caffeine solution by the same company.

I can’t recommend this product enough! Everyone’s skin is different of course, but I have generally very sensitive skin and this stuff worked wonders for me!

Side note: If you can purchase through Ulta or the company directly, it is WAY cheaper. But if you can only purchase through Amazon for whatever reason, it’s still worth every penny!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m 35 and working with all the potions so I keep getting carded. “Oh you think I’m 27, 28?” I don’t hate it! It took awhile for this to grow on me but once I saw results over the course of 2 weeks, I was impressed and a believer! It helps with minimizing pores, but I use it addition to other products as well. I can’t give all the credit Eva but her participation in my pm routine is one of importance! My face feels a little tight I’m a good way after I apply it but with additional moisturizers, my face feels so clean and fresh! I only use it at night, the sun made my face a little pinker than usual. It wasn’t painful, just annoying and it feels like my face is the color of Bubble Yum, which isn’t uncommon. But it’s fine overnight!

For awhile I didn’t use it because it’s not very viscous and it was hard to apply. I saw a video of someone taking the dropper and swiping it across her forehead, cheeks, chin and neck, working each in sections. Game changer, y’all!

Lastly, it works and it’s affordable- 2 important things I assess. I wish I could do everything Drunk Elephant all day everyday but be real, I, personally, am not that rich. Eva keeps me lookin fresh on a budget."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So this is now I think the 3rd bottle I have bought. For some context I have mild normal acne as well as cystic acne (mostly hormonal). So this means I get mostly blackheads and congestion, a few whiteheads and cysts around my chin mostly. This product is one of the only products that I have used consistently and it continues to work well.

I use this almost every other day (which I know some people will say is too much) but it was worked perfect for me. And I do not have oily skin, I have combination skin and even using this product so frequently it has not caused much dryness (although I use a lot of moisturizer afterwards). As the directions say I use it for about 10 minutes as well and it stings a little bit, but definitely isn't painful in my opinion. Over time I think this has helped my pores shrink and my face look less congested. I would recommend this product to almost anyone no matter what your skin concern is.

In fact, a few weeks ago I ran out of this for a little over a week and found myself getting a lot of pimples. I do not know if not using this product was the direct cause but I definitely think it influenced my breakout because I am back to using this product and no longer have pimples very frequently."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LONG REVIEW AHEAD!!!

I had perfect skin until I went on birth control as an adult. I don’t have sensitive skin however any blemish I get will leave a dark spot no matter if I squeeze it or not. My hormonal acne has been making me feel super self conscious especially when I had great skin prior to Depo.

I’ve tried everything. Vitamin C. Turmeric. Retinol. And nothing has worked better than this.

I’d like to advise however I DO NOT USE THIS AS DIRECTED! I use this every other day because in my opinion my skin is already trash so what do I got to lose besides dark spots? I cleanse with my Clarisonic, dry my face and apply for 10 minutes every other day at night. And not on the same day I use a retinol cream or Vitamin C serum. I use after cleansing and before toner. If you use a spin brush or an exfoliating cleanser this mask is going to BURN. Not unbearable but definitely not comfortable. And definitely patch test before using something this strong.

The first picture in my review was the day before I used it and the second picture is a week later to the day after applying this mask every other day (I don’t advise anyone else to do this so don’t blame the ordinary if you burn your skin off)

I recommend 10000000%"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Im a little astonished as I think this products actually works. Ive tried many lotions & potions and really....not much does much. This works immediately. I can feel it tingling/slightly burning within seconds. I have never left it on for more than 10 mins and I rinse my face thoroughly afterwards. It gets rid of dead skin (it is better than exfoliating by far), my skin does look smoother and not as dry. Now....its not getting rid of the wrinkles, however I am very satisfied with this. I do think my skin looks better."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,So glad I bought this. I am obsessed with acid peels because how healthy it makes your skin look. I have battled tretinoin for over a year and never again. This line of acid products had dramatic results fast! I am team acid. This is my favorite because it works and it is amazing. It is a strong acid peel. But not damaging at all. It's not going to break you out or stress your skin. I used to suffer from random cystic acne breakouts. I did research and thankfully discovered using acid's. This is the best brand and it's so cheap. Compare the ingredients to expensive brands. This stuff will change your life. If you have any type of problematic skin The whole line will clear it up. I have gone from blotchy red random acne on my jaw to beautiful tight and glowing skin. My pores are practically invisible and I have glowing skin for the first time in my life. Thank God for the ordinary. My Ordinary products are : I use the glycolic acid toner and 10% Lactic acid peel every night with the caffeine eye serum and after the lactic has dried I apply Hyaluronic acid and a few nights a week I use glycolic acid peel the other 2 nights I use this awesome AHA peel. But this AHA is the strongest of those. Love it.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to be working and keeping my face looking great
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, this is the holy grail of masks.

I LOVE The Ordinary. I have long used their niacinamide serum and glycolic acid peel. But I really needed something a little less potent, since my skin had become dryer with the medications I am on.

Insert this angel. I added it to my routine (Cetaphil wash, The Ordinary Glycolic Acid Toner and Corsx Snail serum, on a weekly basis). This is the third week and I have noticed a huge diminishing in my uneven skin tone and acne scarring. I look younger and my skin glows after. It doesn’t burn like stronger peels and my skin only slightly reddens after.

I suffered from adult acne for a couple years. Since I started using the routine mentioned above, along with spironolactone, my skin has improved SO much. I often go without makeup now.

You really can’t go wrong with The Ordinary, but this mask in particular is amazing.

Photo is of my face immediately following using the mask."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m a big fan of The Ordinary brand overall and had wanted to try this for awhile. I use it about once every 2 weeks on my face, beck and chest and still have a lot left in the bottle. The consistency is very fluid so be careful not to drip into your eyes or mouth. I typically use a clean makeup brush to spread it all over and set a timer. Either in the shower or sink I use a soft cloth to gently remove it.

I would advise using it for only a few minutes at first and build up to the max 10 min. It’s very strong, but because it doesn’t really burn like some AHA’s it can seem like it’s not doing enough. Definitely wear sunscreen and moisturize well after use.

I had cystic acne for years and then developed mild melasma from birth control. Using this in my routine has really helped to smooth the texture of my skin and make it brighter overall. My other products soak right in and my texture is improved.

Just as a recommendation- if you use a retinol, I would plan to not use it a few nights before doing this peel. Retinol and AHA’s can be over exfoliating to your skin causing severe irritation, redness, burning, peeling and worst case: scarring."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m 41 years old, and have blotchy, uneven skin, hyperpigmentation, and just kind of overall feel like my skin has just gone to heck in the last 5-7 years with aging. I’ve been taking steps over the past several years to start trying to make up for lost time with caring for my skin...which I hadn’t bothered with before I hit my late 30’s.

I can see a REMARKABLE difference after using this product only twice so far! I really didn’t expect a whole lot, but figured I had nothing to lose....and there is absolutely a difference in my skin texture - sooo much smoother!! Hyperpigmentation has faded - and as much as it’s faded after only using this stuff 2 times, I anticipate it will only continue to improve! My skin looks fresher, younger, and the blotchiness is gone. My skin is an even color - just dealing with those hyperpigmentation areas, which are fading out already.

Great stuff - I will continue to buy and there is literally NO WAY on Earth that you can use this stuff and NOT see improvement. You WILL see a difference."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product has lasted me three months so far and I use it at least once a week. If you’ve never had a professional chemical peel, then you should know - this tingles and itches like a professional peel. My skin is red for about 20 minutes after. Sometimes the intensity of it has me hop around from foot to foot and fanning my face. However, it does a great job of increasing brightness. I would recommend using this as a step in a sequence of skincare, not as a stand-alone product. For example, I will use this on a night when I: steam, double cleanse, tone, ionic clean w/nutritive oil, dermaplane, THEN use this peel as a last step before I add my nightly moisturizer/treatment.
It’s a strong product- I would compare it to Drunk Elephants Sukari Baby Facial, for a fraction of the price.
I will buy again. I do believe the product helps primarily with exfoliation. I feel like I’m doing something in between medical peels."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I highly recommend this product if you have sensitive skin and you've thought about chemical peels but are scared of the recovery time or harshness of it! This left me feeling super smooth after the first day or so! I have skin texture, pores/blackheads on my nose and an occasional break out of acne, which this helped with. I use it about every week and a half or two weeks, and will typically start off with a hot shower and facial cleanse and then a bore strip while the pores are open, then I'll use this for the recommended 10 minutes (try less if you are using for the first time to see how sensitive you are.) I do notice redness and ""warmth"" after I use it for about 30 minutes, but use a moisturizer and then Mario Bedescu facial mist as needed for extra moisture. I experience some extra skin roughness the morning after I use it, but the days after are phenomenally smooth and I do see break out resolved and clearer pores! I highly recommend this budget friendly product! (Also it's $9 from The Ordinary's site)"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had moderate to severe acne scaring, crepiness, and discoloration. I've always taken good care of my skin, but bad skin (cystic acne and premature aging) runs in the family. After Accutane my acne has pretty much gone, but my skin looked much older than it should. I started using this at the same time as retinol, vitamin c, and hyroaluric acid. I think they all help, but I can see and feel a dramatic difference immediately after using this. My skin looks and feels pretty much normal now. It definitely seemed abnormal before especially in sunlight. One somewhat negative was that it lightened my skin. I had thought the light parts of my super blotchy skin were the discoloration. Turns out it was the dark spots which makes sense since my skin was lighter as a child. I'll take it though since my scars and crepiness are so much better."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff is amazing. Like... WHY DID I WAIT?? Seriously, everyone should incorporate this into their skin care routine. I use it ~2 times/week and my skin is so much more smooth and bright. I use this in lieu of exfoliating since i never liked the idea of scraping my skin. This works even better imo. Yeah, it kinda hurts, but only for the first 30 seconds. And I find once that's done, you can really wash it off right then. If you use retinol nightly, skip the nights you use this peel and replace with hyaluronic acid instead to keep from traumatizing your skin too much. Also an aloe vera-based moisturizer works wonders for the aftercare. I like Holika Holika's aloe sheet masks or their aloe pack. Anyone can use this, as long as you follow up with soothing moisturizers.

My pores have actually shrunk and my texture is so much better. For like 12 bucks, what do you have to lose?"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've heard many refer to this as the holy grail of face product, some even going as far to say it must be the blood of the blessed Virgin Mary. I'm not sure about all of that, but it does do a lot to remove the dry skin and buildup from your face, smoothing out lines, exfoliating, revealing new fresh layers of skin. Helps a lot with pore blockages and making red marks fade faster. Makes the turnover rate of the skin happen faster. Do not leave on skin for longer than 10 minutes, as it can cause irritation . But your face will look much fresher after a week or two of use !"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm pretty darn impressed with this product! I had purchased this after several reviews and tutorials seen on YouTube and with explanation of it's benefits if it's incorporated into a daily facial routine. It explains how it can help your skin if consistently used either 1-2 times a week depending how sensitive your skin is. It also helps prevent future acne you may be getting. The product is a great consistency, it's a deep rich red, and has an almost fruity soft smell that is not harsh at all. Do not leave it on no longer than 10-12 minutes as they state, and it rinses of easily. My skin in the end has a beautiful glow, my skin is super soft and supple it's amazing how it improves my skin after only 10 minutes. So far I am starting to see some of my pores and scars diminishing. Granted I know it may not fully go away, but they are helping minimize what i have."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product takes some patience but it is WORTH IT. The first time I used it, I left it on for way too long, had terrible peeling and irritation and ended up quitting it for a while. Then I saw a YouTube review of it and tried it again. This time, I started with a thin layer all over my face and neck, leaving it on for exactly five minutes (not more). I used it about every 4-5 days on on those days I didn't use any retinol products. Follow it up right away with a good moisturizer and even the Ordinary Marula Oil. I've found this has really evened out my complexion, helped with adult acne and blackheads, reduced some hyperpigmentation, smoothed my skin and given me a glow I haven't had, well, ever. Recommend searching for some videos on how to use this correctly and then TRY IT! Oh, and the price point is impossible to beat."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,The results weren’t dramatic but unlike most over the counter products they were definitely there. I’ve been using it twice a week for a couple of months and absolutely have seen a difference. I still have faint spots but I’m sure over time they’ll completely fade. I did take a before & after (same lighting & can see an obvious difference) but I’m just too shy to post pictures of myself lol. I’ve even had a couple of my friends give me some positive comments lately which is what even reminded me that it was probably worth it to write a review. If you’re too sketched out to get professional chemical peels or IPL order this stuff instead. It’ll take longer to get results but you will get them and won’t run the risk of a botch job. It does sting/tingle a bit but nothing crazy. Just take the directions seriously and keep it out of reach of kids.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,The picture is from the morning after. Don’t mind my lips as I had micro-needled lightly the night before with my Dr. Pen and had HA and aquaphor slathered on my lips- I did a very superficial micro-needle then used the peeling solution. It gets warm and tingly almost like a light burn but not unbearable; after the peel I used Buffet from The Ordinary then Elemis pillow facial night moisturizer with a small mix of Elemis Superfood glowing moisturizer (I mixed the smallest drop in the pillow facial moisturizer). My skin was so soft and when I woke up I was shocked to already see a difference. I stood in front of a window so sunlight would show my skin and flaws! I use this now at least once a week depending if I’m using my retinoid. Highly suggested!

My acne isn’t as bad as it used to be but I still get some cystic bumps from time to time especially around my period. I also tend to have to exfoliate my skin a lot especially around my forehead. It seems like my skin seems to build up more than most, probably because I suffer from extreme oily skin. I tried this out cuz it seems exfoliating with other products just wasn’t doing the job. This product does not burn, it feels a little “spicy” but mostly just kinda itchy. But it’s tolerable for 10/15 minutes. I began using this along with a derma roller and pure Hyaluronic acid and my skin has seriously improved and it hasn’t even been a month. I had a pretty big crease in my forehead from getting a bad case of sun burn when I was 14, and now at 23 it’s almost completely gone and I can’t be more happy"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve been using this product for about a year now and still continue to see results. The skin on my face and neck are remarkably brighter and smoother when I use it. I’ve gotten spoiled to the results and can definitely notice a difference when I skip it. It’s an incredible value.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is a great alternative to mechanical exfoliators (exfoliating beads or particles) which can cause tears in the skin; however, if you have sensitive skin, I would caution that you test the product on a small area of your skin before applying it all over. Further, I would also suggest that you do not leave the product on for the full 10 mins if your skin is sensitive.

I use this product when I notice that my skin is looking dull. I make sure to moisturize and drink plenty of water following the treatment as it can really dry out the skin. It may leave your skin red after removal, but this should go away within a few minutes. It can also lead to minor breakouts and its cleansing the skin and drawing out bacteria/dirt in your pores so I recommend using this product after any important events!"

Had laser skin resurfacing and other lasers and was on accutane twice for cystic acne. I’m telling you nothing has done as much for me as this peel has. I have been using it for a little over two months. Once a week for ten minutes maximum. After I don’t use anything else on my skin for 24 hours. I then resume nightly retinol cream. I haven’t had a breakout once, and my scars are diminishing. I don’t they they’ll ever go away totally but really are not as noticeable and my skin looks so much better. It is about $5 more than the Ordinary’s website, but with the shipping and the two week wait you need if you order from there this is a much better deal in the end. Also, it does burn and itch a bit when you first put it on, but it’s an acid! Of course it will...."

I haven't been using this long enough to see a change to my texture, but this is the first time since I was 22 (30 now) that I don't have a single pimple/ clogged pore on my face. The max amount of time I handle with a generous layer of is 3 minutes (the darker the color red on your face, the greater the sting in my opinion; a really opaque layer caused hardly any stinging at all [which only feels like stinging pins, in a 2/10 on a pain scale; almost like really broken skin when you put pimple ointment on it]). I only do it once a week, always at night, wear a generous amount of sunscreen and try to shade my face from sun the next day. No post-application sensitive or discomfort. As gentle as a chemical exfoliator can get."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, so when I first tried this product I was pretty sure I’d bought a dud. Put it on and felt no tingles or had any indication it was working whatsoever but as soon as I took it off- brighter, clearer skin revealed. I would say I saw a 60-70% reduction in the skin issues plaguing me before I tried this.
My aesthetician recommends I do regular glycolic peels on my own at home so this is what I do twice a week. I’m pretty sure I could use this more times a week Bc I’m sure my ski. Could handle it but I don’t want to waste product.
For what I paid and the speediness I’d delivery, I’m very happy with this product. In addition I also use glossiers the solution and lots of moisturizers. Sunscreen is just so you don’t add on more damage to your freshly beautified skin 🤗."

It has also lightened a dark mark from a years old acne scar on my cheek. I have pale skin, am in my late 30s and recently the texture of my skin has started looking sort of rough. I have always exfoliated with various scrubs three times a week but they weren't cutting it anymore so I thought I would try a peel. It does sting a little initially but that wears off about three minutes in. I also noticed the pores on my nose that look like little black dots no matter what I use are actually almost undetectable now which is awesome. It takes very little of this solution for each treatment so it is definitely worth the money. My skin looks better than it did after I the one time got a facial. Definitely recommend. Don't forget to use sunscreen EVERY day. Especially if you are using this type of product."

I have a friend whop has some skin trouble, and I just gave her the rest of my bottle because I believe in the stuff so much and wanted her to try it. I bought mine immediately after so I wouldn't have to go long without it. I have a very pale complexion, combination dry oily skin. I have never kept the peel on for more than 10 min, and have not had a problem with burning or stinging after it is removed.
Whenever I feel a breakout coming on I make sure to use this peel to give my skin just the pick me up it need. Definitely will continue to keep buying this item, and hopefully try out more of The Ordinary products in the future!"

It did not disappoint! I've used this product about 3 times so far. I was little worried before my first use, after I bought it I read the label said not suitable for sensitive skin. So I only used a small amount. It felt slightly tightening/warm sensation but very mild. I left it on for 10 min as suggested. It did really well and I had no reaction to it so the next couple of times I used a bit more. I've had no problems with it. I have some rosacea on my cheeks but it didnt bother it which I was surprised. It left my skin super soft and didn't hardly dry my skin like I thought it would. Great product and I'd highly recommend!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this for dark spots. Earlier this yr I had a couple of breakouts that left very dark black marks on my face. I was using a daily serum, but it kept making me get more pimples. Even if I don't pick my pimples I get post inflammatory hyper pigmentation, that takes years to go away if I don't use something to hurry the process. Anyway I got this product on July 5th. I've used it every Thursday and Monday, for 10 min since (today is Aug 27th). I have seen a major improvement. My dark marks are no longer super dark, more like a light light brown color. I still have more than half the bottle left and I use it all over my face. It's def a very gentle peel. I don't get any peeling of flaking. I don't even really feel it stinging, but it works wonders. I'm very satisfied."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Warning: If you have sensitive skin this may not work for you or you'll need to use it for less than 10 minutes and only one or two days a week. I personally LOVE this product and I've got tough skin so I can do this every other day. Basically it's an acid mask so it's thicker than you would expect, and it's beet red so don't be surprised. Anyway this mask appx 3-4 times a week along with my Vitamin C Serum and Glycolic Acid Face Cream (other companies) has made a HUGE difference in my skin (I'm almost 57). My aesthetist can't believe the difference and in fact wrote the products down, and told me not to waste my money on an acid peel or microdermabrasion at their clinic because she can't see where it's going to help more than what I'm already doing!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very pleased with the product: I’m 36 with mild acne on oily skin and didn’t know what exact products to use honestly cuz there’s 9 million choices at the stores. I never tried a peeling solution before. My dermatologist recommended this brand cuz she uses it. I use this Wednesday and Saturday’s for 6-7 minutes. My skin does feel tingly. Then she recommended Vitamin C solution, Trentonin Rx, eye cream, Neutrogena Oily skin moisturizer and AcneZone face wash. To warn you the color of this is blood red: that’s the thing I wish I could change cuz it looks gore-y, but I’m happy with results. Used for 1 month and my face looks smoother and I had 2 enlarged pores on my forehead I thought I’d live with forever (Derm says nothing could really be done in office). The pores have minimized greatly and I think will continue to with more use."

My acne has always been there since I was a teenager and I’m now 34 years old. I finally found the products that my face loves and that’s helping me clear my acne. There is a slight sting at first, but just make sure you don’t keep it on more than 10 minutes and don’t do it more than twice a week. I consider this a lighter peeling product and it doesn’t make your face red or over peel. I didn’t even notice the “shedding of dead skin”. I have recently been doing a face care routine this year and I never knew my face would go through “purging” but after the process for about a month or so. You will see awesome results and clearer skin! Love the ordinary products and make sure you moisturize afterwards."

I discovered this product from a friend's instagram accct and I LOVE IT. Now, I use this product about 2x a week and it exfoliated better than my clairsonic had ever. Because I have sensitive skin, I used this product in small increments leaving it on for 3 min, then 5, then now 10. Be careful though to make sure that the skin is dry before use or it will sting. This product has helped me eradicate decades of acne scars, whiten my skin, and give me more of a glow. Highly recommend!"

Now these are authentic- there are two slightly different formulations the company released to meet country guidelines. These are the North American/Canadian version as seen by the blue mark on the bottle. I read this on the website and ordered a comparison bottle from the company. This one from amazon is the real thing and tingles a bit when on the face. I’ve been using it twice a week for three weeks now along with beauty counter, Elemis cleansers, and other ordinary serums and I am blown away by how my skin is changing! I am getting subtle softness and elasticity back and my skin looks clear and smooth like it did 20 years ago! Very impressed. Ordinary brand has become my new favorite."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, if you have sensitive skin steer so clear of this thing. My dudes I am not even kidding about this one. It will eat straight through your skin and into your SOUL. That being said, for the rest of us this thing is AWESOME. I have dry-normal skin with occasional peeling and this plows straight through the dead stuff. I use it once a week (as directed) and have seen great results after four months of consistent application. Smoother skin and overall less breakouts. Final tip: PILE ON THE SUNSCREEN AFTER YOU USE THIS! If you don't dream of being a wrinkled leather handbag someday please protect your skin after peeling layers off of it. No joke this leaves your skin very sensitive for the days following. Always wear sunscreen, but especially after this one."

I struggle off and on with my skin, and the last few months it’s been really dry which has led to some pesky break outs I couldn’t get under control even after seeing my esthetician 2 times for microdermabrasion. The first time I used this my skin actually felt hydrated and softer. I followed it with aloe and my usual moisturizer. I gave it a week or so before using again. Then I used it 2 nights in a row, both followed again with aloe and moisturizer. My Dry skin is finally subsiding and my break out isnt nearly as bad! I don’t want to over do it, but I truly think my skin needed this stuff to get the dead layers off & am Hoping to continue to have good results."

I've spent so much time and money trying to get rid of blackheads. Using masks and pore strips and peel off masks and everything, but I could never get them out. I finally was doing research and came upon the magic of salicylic acid. I've used this twice and after the second time I could see the blackheads actually start to surface which was super interesting. I'm also using a 20% salicylic acid, so I'm pretty sure it's a combo of the 2, but seriously, my skin is already thanking me. I am 27 and have been struggling with acne for half of my life. This past week I've been comfortable going out with no makeup, and my skin just glows! I can't wait to see the progress once I've been using this longer."

I have dehydrated combo acne prone skin, and am very used to AHA and BHA in my daily skincare routine. I definitely enjoy this mask as a quick exfoliation on the go if I don't have time for my proper routine, but I wouldn't use it any more than 1x a week because it is quite strong. However - one of the best parts of it, and what I consider my favorite part is how the solution is tinted a deep cranberry color. It makes it so simple to make sure you have all traces off your face when you rinse it off - especially with acids of this concentration, if left on it could severely burn your skin.

I'll most definitely repurchase, I enjoy having a peel once a week and it makes my skin so glowing! Really recommend"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall i like this product a lot, it shrinks my pores and makes my skin soft. i’ve seen people use it all over their face but that actually makes me break out. i suggest, if you have sensitive or combo skin, to use it only on the spots where it’s needed. for example i use it on my t zone, chin, and directly next to my nose on both sides where my acne is bad and my pores are the largest. it clears everything up right away. However, i would never use it on my cheeks or forehead because it would do more harm than good. it doesn’t hurt that bad at all and it causes very minimal redness that goes away after about an hour."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff is skin saving if you have scarring and need that extra boost. The first time I used it, I had oil cleansed first like with most masks and because it is a chemical solution, it mixed with the leftover oil and started irritating/itching my skin. I washed it off and tried the next day - without having cleansed or ANYTHING beforehand and it worked perfectly. I do it on Saturday mornings when I have coffee right when I wake up before I do my skincare routine so there is no residue or products on my skin that could irritate it.

I use The Ordinary's Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA, Vitamin C Serum, and the Rosehip Oil and this has been an excellent addition to my routine. Again, read the directions! This isn't any old sheet mask you can slap on after a shower."

The liquid is thick and a reddish color making it easy to apply and showing if you've missed any spots. I left it on 10 minutes as directed and only experienced mild stinging. My skin was very bright afterwards and felt a little firmer. I applied it 2 days ago and haven't had any flaking or peeling, which is a little disappointing since it's a peel, but I plan to use it again in the next few days and to leave it on longer this time. Despite that, I really do feel that the product is ""as advertised."" I've used other at home peels and the quality of this is higher than those. I would say if you're looking for a mile peel, this is a great choice."

I have started my skin journey with a lot of researching and hours of searching for the right products to purchase that will suit my skin and that will fit perfectly in what my skin routine lacks. I came across this and I have to really thank the ordinary for creating a product that comes just as close to getting a professional facial treatment. Yes it does dry out your skin if left on for too long and yes it’s suppose to feel tingly. DO NOT USE LONGER THEN RECOMMENDED. Also use sunscreen while using this product"

I definitely have suffered with acne my entire life into adulthood and this product (I use at least once weekly but not more than twice a week) has cleared my acne, given my skin a glowing appearance and has faded my acne scars. I am always skeptical with these types of products and have yet to find one that actually works but then i found this one. Highly recommend for acne prone skin, but you must use a good moisturizer after (I have always used aveeno calm, which works great after this product!!).

Just make sure you never ever use this product on wet or damp skin, it definitely burns badly and I learned that the hard way!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is doing the job for me. Prepare for a fairly intense tingling / burning when you put it on at first. Oh ya, and be sure to warn anyone who may be around you while you have this mask on as it looks like blood! Ha! I have scared my partner so many times walking out of the bathroom with this on my face. You can have fun with that! :)

This delivers the exfoliation I need. I can tell it works by the slight dryness I get the next day after this mask + very mild flaking that goes away after about 12 hours. It is easy to hide if you keep your skin hydrated. It doesn't look bad by any means. I like to use this product on Sunday nights and by Tuesday I have glowy, ""new"" skin."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’d heard about the Ordinary and bought this peel in a treat yo self moment. I have sensitive skin and patch tested it first without any reaction. I applied it to clean, dry skin and it has a slightly almost burning sensation- like if you rubbed freshly squeezed orange juice on your face as an exfoliant- not painful, but it’s definitely doing something.

I know it’s a you have to try it for yourself, but I think there was a small improvement to the visibility of my pores, especially around my nose. Hopeful for more improvement with more use, though I’ll probably stick to the recommendation of 2x/week only.

If you’re on the fence, it’s a good price, it shouldn’t irritate your skin, and it’s likely you’ll see results!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good peeling acid. I really like that it has a pink/fushia tint so that you know what areas it has been applied to. For a 30% concentration I found that it was rather mild, it does not itch as much as other acids i have used in the past. I think it is a good option for those with more sensitive skin. But it is strong, i would not recommend leaving it on more than the specified 10minutes! It could dry out skin. So far it has not caused redness or peeling on my face. I apply it to dry clean skin, leave on for 10 MINUTES, and rinse with coldwater. Afterwards I apply some vitamin C serun and a moisturizer. I have noticed some fading of old acne spots over the past 2 weeks, so I am quite happy with this purchase."

When I put it on I had fears it was gonna burn because my skin can be sensitive sometimes and I have combination skin part of it being oily and others dry but it wasn’t really painful if anything the same amount of pain as popping a small zit if anything. The only thing I recommend is use a moisturizer after and when you first get it if your skin is sensitive start at 5 mins then go up a min each time till you get to ten min but other than that this stuff is gold!
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I am ALL ABOUT REVIEWS!! PLEASE READ!
I read these reviews before I purchased this, because I wanted to see results. Unfortunately I forgot to take a before picture, but believe me when I tell you that IT REALLY WORKS. A lot of people said that this was a fake product because it was different from the original one and it didn’t “burn” like the “real” product. I also bought the actual product from the ordinary website to compare. THEY ARE THE EXACT SAME!!!! Sometimes it doesn’t burn and sometimes it does. It really depends on the day or if I popped a pimple prior to putting the solution on. THIS IS A REAL PRODUCT!!! And it works wonders!!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Probably the best chemical exfoliating mask out there. A little goes a long ways. Take heed if you have extra sensitive skin as this stuff can burn a little, which bottle says not to leave on for longer than 10 min and no more than twice a week. Leaves my skin glowing, smooth and cuts down on my breakouts."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical of ordering something new, such as a face product, online... However, all the reviews say this is amazing... so after letting it sit in my cart for MONTHS... I finally purchased. I LOVE this! I try to use it every Sunday night, and my skin feels incredible afterwards. I feel like I have a glow, and my skin is beaming the next day. I highly recommend. I actually have two friends who use it now too. I will have to upload a picture because I know I love seeing pictures on reviews! This is a great purchase!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good product buy it and stop spending money on another product that doesn't work. Too bad I won't buy it again because there are no stains
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"almost finished my first bottle. I have combination skin, but more on the oily side. I have adult hormone related acne and my cyctic breakouts turn into hyper pigmentation and I find that chemical exfoliates help to brighten the scarring. I have tried other peels that were stronger and my skin is pretty tough but I like the ability to use this a few times a week and not having that feeling of burning during the process. consistency is thick so its not drippy and messy. if you use a fan brush its easy to apply evenly without a mess or wasting product. I find it better to apply a second coat of it about halfway through. I am already placing another order for my 2nd bottle."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you have bad acne this is greattt for you. You don’t have to use it too often either for it to work. Now I only have to use it when I start to feel a break out. It goes away once I use this.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My skin has been looking awful lately. Clogged/large pores, redness, scarring, bumpy complexion. Gross. I've tried everything - washes, masks, oils, topicals. Nothing helped. Very frustrating.

I bought this on a whim figuring I have nothing to lose. After I bought it - I realized there were different strengths, so I was a little nervous about burns. I tried it for the first time last night. Left it on for almost 10 minutes. (It didn't burn at all.) Rinsed and applied vitamin e as a moisturizer and went to bed.

This morning - my skin looks significantly better. It looks much clearer/smoother across my cheeks and nose. Redness and large pores seem to have reduced. I think I've found my skin saver."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing seemed to work on my skin which is both bumpy in spots and has large pores in others. This product is AMAZING. I've been using once to twice a week for about two months and my pores are smaller, the bumps are smaller, and the texture of my skin is smoother (wish I'd taken a before picture so I can show you the difference). I am seriously so happy because I was desperate and was going to drop a large sum on getting a professional chemical peel but this is an expensive yet very effective way to get the same results! It leaves my face red for about 12-24 hours after but this is a small price to pay for such good results!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes my skin feel great. I try not to use it actually as much as it recommends because I do other things with my face like hanacure masks and all that so I don't want to totally dry out my skin. But the few times I have used it I really like how my complexion feels and looks. I don't know if its all this product or a combination of things I do but it's still nice. It doesn't feel uncomfortable. I think the derma e mask feels a lot more painful than this lol. It didn't stain my skin or anything. I didn't notice any peeling or redness after.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have very oily skin, milia, and a lot of enlarged pores from messing with my face. I've used this twice now and both times I visibly saw the appearance of my pores decrease, and one of my large milia (this sucker was massive) shrank so much that noone believed it was there the next day when I pointed it out. The product didn't tingle and worked fine for my friend's sensitive dry skin. I really like it so far, it does what it says, contains pure ingredients at higher concentrations than most brands, and is such a fraction of the price. Love this and I plan on looking for more products like it from theordinary."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok so I normally do not leave reviews for products but I HAD to for this. If you’re picky about buying products and worried about them not working or breaking you out like I am, then please read this. I am prone to breakouts sometimes, especially during that time of the month. I have some old acne scarring from high school and this has been the only thing that will work for my skin! I use it once a week because I do have very sensitive skin. Overall, I love this product and I highly recommend. Sorry I don’t have pictures!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,So i ordered. This couole weeks ago now i wanted to see bow long it would take to see any difference or is it all talk but i couldnt believe this but my skin is so soft smooth makeup looks better on my face looks less bumpy than it did before like i was covering uo a bunch of pimples. Make sure your face is dry and clean when applying but you feel small amount of tingling after a min or two i like it it lets me know its working ! If your thinking should you buy this trust me you wo t regret it!
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Solution is easy to use and works well
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I put it on for the first time I really didn't know what to expect. Will my face slough off? Will I be left with nothing but a Kruger face? Will it do anything at all? My first time I barely put any on and I left it on for just 4 minutes and WHOA could I feel the difference as soon as it came off. I highly recommend this product. It doesn't come with all of the ""fluff"" that a lot of beauty products come with (e.g. vegan fed sea algae and caffeinated quinoa sprouts for maximum glow!) and it's reasonably priced. I love it! My only advice is to take it easy the first couple of applications."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I suffer from hormonal acne so I didn't think that anything topical would really work for me. However, I would like to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this product. Everytime I use it (about once a week) the days after, my skin is soft, bright and incredibly moisturized.

I use with the Ordinary hyaluronic acid as a serum afterwards, along with a CeraVe moisturizer and I can say that my skin is the best it's ever been. Also the burn is not too much, compared to some other products I've used as a prescription from a dermatologist. I would definetly buy it again."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is amazing. I’ve recommended it to a lot of my friends already. I definitely see a noticeable difference, especially when it comes to the wrinkles on my forehead. My skin feels so soft and smooth after using it. I will admit, it isn’t terribly comfortable while you have it on, but it’s bearable. It stings a bit, and almost kind of itches almost like hair bleach might feel on your scalp. I haven’t experienced any issues with over drying, redness etc. I will absolutely buy this again."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i don't find it to be as strong as it's described. I love it still... I think it's effective and does the job well - and it didn't burn my skin. The price point is also amazing. I went to SEPHORA looking for the product because it's advertised on their site, but one of the associates told me they don't carry it in the store because it's a ""low-end"" product? What that means? Nonetheless I found it here. I am happy now. I only use it once a week. I imagine for virgin skin this product may be too much for first time use."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product has done WONDERS for my skin! I started breaking out a few months back due to severe stress and anxiety. I started forming some cystic acne in places I had never broke out before! Until recently I discovered this gem, I used this twice a week for about 3 weeks straight and saw results within the first week of use! Disclaimer: do not use on popped zits. It will burn and turn into a scar! Only use on non open areas. Other than that it has drastically helped me and my appearance!"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is absolutely amazing. I just used it last night for the 3rd time and I'm absolutely in love. I have issue with closed comedones on my chin and jawline and nothing had seem to help, including other chemical exfoliants. After 3 uses all those little bumps are almost gone! The first 2 times I used it I only left it on for 4 minutes, and the 3rd time I left it on for 5 minutes. I think its really important to slowly work up to the 10 minute duration. I have already ordered 2 other products from The Ordinary website. Their website is about half the price as here, but you have to wait for the items to be delivered."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I saw instant results with this product. My face was visibly smoother and my makeup went on so much better after just one use. I’m really excited to see how my skin looks after a few months of use. My skin tingled a bit at first, when I but the mask on, but after a minute or two of wearing the mask I forgot that it was on and the minutes went by very quickly. I’m 100% sure that I’ll be buying this mask over and over again. Totally love it!"

I saw this from TikTok, used the amt that’s shown in the pic the first few weeks and then really saturated my face with it these past 2 weeks and my skin has never been greater. I use other products like aloe and vitamin e, honey serum, cetaphil moisturizer and almond liquid after and use twice weekly instead of once. This product does not disappoint, I recommend!"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE this peel but it’s too expensive on amazon. Was shocked to see it was almost 2/3 the price I paid for the first one I got on here. Highly recommend it if you have skin that is used to acids/want anti-aging/look refreshed. If you don’t, use/start with over the counter acids because if you use this right away for the 10 minutes indicated, you *WILL* get chemical burns and/or scars on your face!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!! I use this on my keratosis pilaris affected areas during the winter months and bikini area 10 days before a Brazilian. It’s an INCREDIBLE product- just be very careful & educate yourself/acclimate your skin to it first!!!!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this exfoliator. I'm not going to lie it stings a bit but once you rinse this off your skin feels smooth and looks clearer. I am used to using an AHA so I started with twice a week but went down to once a week because my skin was peeling more than I wanted and was starting to get a bit dry (I have oily combo skin so that should tell you how strong this is). It does exactly what it says it will do and I will continue to buy this every time I run out. It's one of the best chemical exfoliators I have used in a while.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This peeling mask is incredible. Does the job of products that are 4-5x as expensive. It does burn for a second when first applying, try to save exfoliating for either a day or two before applying or the day after applying. Don't apply to broken skin! Strangers were literally complimenting my skin for a week afterwards. It minimized my pores, smoothed out the texture of my skin and made it look luminous. It looks a little bit like blood but thats part of the fun. I have recommended this to everyone I know. I would recommend using this no more than once a week and for no longer than 10 mins."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,omg...this product is soooo good!! I had a lot of second thoughts about this exfoliant. And I did my reading and watched videos on it so I was convinced it worked. I am normally not a 5 star rater but on this I will give it all the way. My skin has never been so glowy and smooth in my life. Yes at first it stings a little but it goes away in a couple of seconds. I use this twice a week and leave it on for 10 minutes after I wash my face and I rinse it off then do my skin care routine as usual.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved it, I use it twice a week 10 minutes as it says in the instructions and I'm fascinated. I'll order it again."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It looks a little scary when you put it on, but this is a great light peel for at-home use. I did notice just a little bit of flaking about four days after my first use, but nothing major. That said, it really helps clarify your skin tone. I believe it may even have some effect on minor lines and wrinkles. I've had more intensive peels in the past, and this is a great maintenance version. You will feel some minor tingling when you put it on, but it's definitely not unmanageable. For the price, you really can't beat it. I"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great home peel that lives up to its word. My face is more dewy after using it and the fine lines (especially on my forehead) have decreased. My skin just overall feels so much better after using this. I do follow up after rinsing it off with a light moisturizer. My skin looks so good, i could go out with next to no make up on (i'd have to put mascara on, but i digress.... )
Great product and you don't need to use a lot per use, so totally worth the money!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so skeptical about getting this product because of the reviews. I even thought it was a fake because I felt no tingling. I compared it to YouTube videos to see if the bottle, product or something showed as a fake, I even bought another one straight from their labs to check... turned out it was 100% real. I was relieved!
I'm that 10-20% of the people that don't feel burning or barely any tingling.
I have been using for 2-3 weeks, just 3-4 times and it's a game changer."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been struggling for YEARS with blackheads on and around my nose and hormonal acne on my chin! I finally hit my breaking point the my forehead started breaking out too. I haven't had a breakout like this in my entire life! I never have bad skin. I finally broke down and got this products along with a new face wash and it COMPLETELY cleared my blackheads overnight and improved my acne!
Make sure to read the directions and don't put it on any wounds though, it was a bit itchy and may burn a lot if on compromised skin."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I read several reviews on The Ordinary products and they have excellent reviews. This chemical peel had great reviews on Google and YouTube. I suggest watching a few You Tube videos on how to use to this product before slapping it on your face. My face immediately felt softer after I washed it off. I am only going to use it once a week and back it up with The Ordinary's Hyaluronic Acid for wrinkles and lines around my eyes. I also take a daily dose of Collagen Peptides.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, this rules. I have tried some $$$$ peels and this works better than any of them...AND for a fraction of the price. I noticed a difference after the first use and the benefits only get better the longer you continue to use it. This is powerful stuff so I don't use this any more than once a week - that's more than enough. It lightens or eliminates any sunspots or discoloration on your skin and makes your face feel soooooo smooth. After I rinse this off, there is some redness to my skin (temporary) but also a certain clarity. I can't totally explain it, you just have to experience it for yourself. It just works wonders!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I cannot tell you how much I LOVE this stuff! I saw it on a Buzzfeed post and decided to check it out and now it is the cornerstone of my skin care routine. I've tried tons and tons of products for my face and have been disappointed because I never saw any results. I've seen the fine lines on my forehead reduced and my skin tone is much more even. Ive also recently added the Niacinamide from The Ordinary and my skin is just glowing! If you're thinking about trying any of their products, do it!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have the type of skin where as long as I prevent clogs from forming it will stay clear but once I start getting a little clogged pores they will turn into cystic acne. My skin is very tolerant of acids so for me it did not burn and using this a couple times a week makes my skin incredibly soft and seems to dissolve any minor clogs and improve texture. One of the best products I’ve bought in recent memory I recommend it to all my friends but I believe you can get it cheaper on the company’s website
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is the holy grail. I've used it every sunday because you can't use it more than once a week, but my skin is so clear now it's unbelievable. However, I also use the ordinary toner a few times a week and CeraVe flaming cleanser almost every day. While I don't have any tingling sensation or bad reactions, I do not recommend this for sensitive skin as it's a strong product, especially those who haven't used AHA before. I do encourage people to use this in their routine as it's helped my skin immensely!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, Advanced Exfoliating Peel for Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using this product for about 2 months and I love it! I've struggled with acne since high school, with severe flare ups happening every once in a while when my face gets used to my regular acne treatment products. This was just what I needed to remove all the extra dead skin cells that had been clogging my pores and causing more breakouts. My face reacts badly to abrasive exfoliators and this mask is the perfect chemical exfoliant for sensitive skin. I have already repurchased it! Highly recommend for those with acne prone skin in need of a good exfoliant!"

Zero hydration, it feels like dish soap. And, if I try to later anything with it.. it balls up, gets gooey.. little globs.

Before I started my previous regimen, I had blackheads in my T-zone. Now, they're back with a vengeance. I gave it 3ish weeks to see if my skin would settle down due to it being a new product for my skin, but I've had it.

Ordinary, you are SUBPAR."

It leaves a residue on your skin and after it dries it flakes off. You cant apply your regular moisturizer on top because it starts to flake is sooo nasty and useless. I saw no results what so ever"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked the product UNTIL they decided to up the price, A LOT. Sorry Ordinary, your product is no longer worth the price."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves my skin glossy and with a dry sensation- complete opposite of moisturizing. I’ve waited extended periods of time to apply moisturizer after applying the hyaluronic acid as instructed and the moisturizer ends up peeling off because of the hyaluronic acid. I have even used multiple moisturizers to test the product and I end up with the same peeling results. Very poor experience with this product.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would not recommend this product. I have heard good reviews of this product when ordered from the company itself, but what I received... I was not impressed with. When you rub in the product it suds up like there is soap in it, and it leaves your face very sticky. I love a good hyaluronic acid serum, but this one just isnt going to cut it."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This product may work very well for others, but for me, it caused cystic acne outbreaks. I have fair and sensitive skin, and this product is not my friend. When I initially used the product, I experienced a breakout and attributed it to monthly changes. Yet, as I continued to use the product, the breakouts persisted. I'll be moving on to another hyaluronic acid."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"To sum up my experience with this product: I have learned that HA is a high maintenance acid if you have dry skin or live in a dry climate. I originally bought this product because everywhere I went, I heard all about how HA is soooo hydrating and it plumps up your skin, and as a very dry-skinned girl, I was excited for it. Nobody told me it was gonna be this hard to use. The fact of the matter is, HA molecules bind to water molecules in the air which is what brings the ""hydrating"" effect to your skin. Now this sounds great BUT, if you live in an extremely dry state like me (Arizona), there is not a lot of water molecules in the air for the HA to bind to. Instead, the acid actually pulls water out of your skin to bind to, which has a temporary hydrating effect but ultimately dehydrates the skin more. If you are a dry-skinned girl like me, living in a dry environment, give Hyaluronic Acid a hard pass. Unless you want to be drinking a ton more water everyday and spending every waking minute with your face in a humidifier."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,I've tried many Hyaluronic acids and this one was so so. I was not impressed at all. It's not a bad option if you're looking for a cheaper alternative but don't expect much from this.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After using this product for a couple of weeks I noticed my skin seemed even drier. I did some research and found that while hyaluronic acid can be great for a lot of people, if you live in a dry environment it can actually make your skin drier. This is because if it can't draw moisture from the air to work, it will actually start taking it from your skin (google, there are lots of good blog posts on this). So, I had to stop using this and once I did my skin improved. I do wish the company would be clearer about this potential side effect as I really thought I was doing something great for my skin and didn't understand that I could actually end up with even drier skin than before. I recommend testing in a small area for several days before using all over your face."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This product has a thick gooey consistency. It’s a great price compared to other more expensive products but I don’t like the way it dries on my skin. It doesn’t feel like my skin actually absorbs any of the product but actually just sits on the surface of my skin and dries very sticky. The product pills when you try to put any other product on your face like primer, foundation or moisturizer. I’ve used other HA’s and never had this problem. I’m disappointed because I was excited about the price and all the wonderful reviews. But I will not be purchasing this again.

But if you want to have nice skin all day, don’t buy it. It peels off. I’ve tried it without moisturizer on top, with moisturizer on top. I did a face scrub beforehand. And it still peels. You’ll leave the house thinking you look great and then you’ll look in the mirror 30 minutes later and you’ll have white flakes all over your face."

This serum is sticky as you put it on but when it dries it is not sticky to the touch but it leaves a film on my skin which peels off! Not great as who wants white stuff peeling off their face!?

I twnd to wait at least two months before reviewing a skin care product. I really haven't seen any results. I was using vitamin c serum (not the same brand) before this product for 6 months along with vitchy cream and definitely I noticed big improvement in the fine lines and moisturizing that reflected in general in face radiance. I am using this ordinary product now with a retinol moisturizer and I am definitely going to swing back to Vitamin C serum instead.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These products have changed my life!!! I’ve always like skincare, but was to lazy/cheap to truly invest in good skincare products, or have a daily routine. I read about The Original in some social network, and was intrigued. I just recently turned 30, and my face was begging for some care, so I tried them out. I did not regret it... these products gave life to my skin! After a few weeks, I noticed my skin is brighter, full of color, super soft, and clear. Just check out which routine best fits your skincare needs, and you’re set.

This product in particular helped bring my skin back to life. It was looking a bit ashy, and tended to dry. This product helps lock moisture in, and makes you skin look plump and healthy. It’s not overnight, but you can clearly see the results after a few weeks.

I want to give this a 10-star review, but the truth is that this product is 3x more expensive in Amazon than it is at The Original’s website. On the plus side, you’ll get your products much faster... but I would rather wait a couple more days and pay a third of the price."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s a good product, just not what I was hoping for with 2% Hyaluronic Acid. Love the concept of the ingredients. The frosted bottle gives an upscale feel. However, the dropper is less than expected as the product drips out before you can reach your face. I replaced the dropped with one from my previous product snd it was a little better. The product doesn’t drip or run out if my replacement dropper, but it is stringy for sone reason. The product seems to be drying even though it’s 2% HA. Had high hopes, reasonably priced, love the concept, the product just doesn’t perform well for me. The packaging functionality didn’t work well for me as well. HOWEVER, I am impressed that the seller reached out for feedback ‘before’ I wrote a review. Shared same concerns with them. Their response was thank you only. I shared with them that I will be reviewing products and writing about them on my blog and website, and hope my feedback improves their product as I would like it to be as expected. I will watch this company and look for improvements, if any are made I may buy again. Otherwise I’ll pass."

I’ll continue to use until empty and if I notice drastic changes I’ll update.

You need to wet your face with water and have damp skin in order for the hyaluronic acid to be applied smoothly and nicely without it being overly sticky. You absolutely need to use this with vitamin c and a moisturizer following applying it or it’ll leave you feeling uncomfortable. I love the Ordinary products, but was expecting a better hyaluronic acid. It makes my skin look really nice when used with other products, but I will admit that this isn’t my favorite from their skincare line."

I can’t really tell if it’s working yet but I’ve only been using it for a week. I’ll have to report back after I use it for a longer period of time but wanted to put my initial thoughts out there.

- Stickiness is kind of annoying and not the most pleasant feeling in the morning.
- Haven’t seen any boost in moisture + plumpness on my face (I’m combination skin, but lean on the dryer side if I don’t moisturize properly)
- Works fine under make-up but I don’t wear a lot
- Works well with TO’s Retinol 2% (I use it at night and this in the morning)

So far I’m very meh?! But I’m going to keep trying."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had heard great things about this serum, so decided to try it out (without realising it is only £5.90 on The Ordinary's website). I use it twice a day after cleansing my face and before moisturizing.

This serum definitely makes the skin look plumper, younger, and healthier. It glides onto the skin easily. However, it can feel sticky and as if it hasn't fully absorbed, and sometimes seems to flake off, especially if worn under make-up. Possibly I was using too much. I must admit, it's a good value for money, but I am going to try other serums in the same price range.

I think I would have been more impressed if it hadn't been hailed as a skincare-Godsend by friends and forums."

It doesn't have smell which is good because is less chemicals in it but, perhaps because the hyaluronic acid percentage is around 2%, it's not really effective against age signs. Well I wasn't expecting a miracle but if you hold your hopes on it pass it on.
It's a nice primer before other creams and it maybe does something who knows."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure if the this hyaluronic acid is meant to be less runny/more stick than other HA products. It was more like a concentrated serum. I bought different HA from Deciem directly and it's more liquid than a serum. Also not too sure if it did the magic. My skin felt the same.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,I know this works for a lot if people but it doesn’t for me. It has made my skin really dry and irritated and if anything makes fine lines appear worse. It is probably just a skin type thing and I have sensitive skin so this maybe why it has affected mine this way but I had to stop using it. If it suits your skin it’s a great price and does feel nice on the skin but just didn’t work for my skin.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"So this dries quickly and make's my skin feel very dry. Plus you have to be really careful what you put over the top of it otherwise it will 'bobble' or 'pill.' Which is of course hopeless for make-up. No kind of oil based moisturiser will mix with it. Somebody put in their review they had previously used Eucerin's hyaluronic serum, and that this made a good replacement. Don't be fooled- it doesn't!"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because I ran out of my usual face lotion, since it had hyal. in it. It seems to be doing pretty well. It’s a small bottle though, and runs out pretty quick. It was light weight and the texture was nice. Absorbed fast."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Originally I left a review that this product does not absorb - I was using it incorrectly. When you're wrong, you're wrong! My bad.

What I learned: You BARELY need to use any of this product. Potentially just a drop for my entire face. I thought I would need much more because my skin is on the drier side, but I think my smaller pores don't allow this serum to absorb as quickly as I assumed. Since I was using too much, it wasn't absorbing before it began to dry, if that makes sense.
I waited a while to update my review, and am leaving 4 stars because while it is moisturizing, it is not much different from a lotion or light cream for me. Usually serums make a noticeable difference within a month, and I haven't really seen much change. I also still need to apply my usual moisturizer, etc., which I thought wouldn't be necessary each night after using this serum.
I recommend trying it though, because everyone is different. Just remember a little goes a long way, and use something like a quartz roller to apply it (so you know it isn't being absorbed by your fingers - plus, the sanitary stone application vs using my hands seems to keep my skin happier!)"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve been wanting to try The Ordinary’s version of HA & happened to find this at the low price of $9.00 so I grabbed it. This is moisturizing & applies nicely. It’s a thicker serum. I didn’t need very much to cover my face. There is a stickiness present so I can see if too much is applied a problem could exist in the skin regime so heads up. The bottle this comes in is very unique & fancy. The dropper is nice & is dispenses nicely. I’ve been a CeraVe HA user for years. Honestly this is nothing better than CeraVe. I’m happy I purchased it at a low price. I recommend it but this is nothing special & once I’m done with it I’ll revert back to using CeraVe which comes with facial benefits the Oridnary HA doesn’t offer.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product a lot. I’ve been using it for a year. The one thing I don’t like about it is how sticky it is so maybe if that could be changed I think that would be awesome. Other than that it’s so cheap and it works so well on my skin. The ordinary is one of my favorite brands and I love it so so much this serum is my favorite product ever. I recommend for younger skin and people that don’t wanna pay a lot of money for a serum!!

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first tried this, I attempted to return it because it was sticky. They wouldn't let me return it, so I gave it another try. It's actually very hydrating and after I did some research I learned all the benefits and while it hydrates it also removes dead skin, and helps with aging! I use a couple drops with my evening moisturizer, after I use The Ordinary Glycolic Acid Toning Solution. The two work really well together. The serum goes on sticky, but once it dries, it's no longer sticky. I took this picture of my hands to show the difference. On the right, you can see dead skin and dry hands - on the left, you can see the dead skin is gone and looks hydrated and smooth! It's quite cheaper on Sephora, but I purchased it through Amazon because of free/fast shipping with Prime."

If you're thinking your skin is magically be a shine of beauty in a day or week, no. No product works like that. Its not a moisturizer. Get out of the shower, dry face, put it on, waite til it dries then put on a reitnol moisturizer such as Olay Luminous/ or Regenergist. Give it a few months. I use it in the am only. I originally bought it for my teenage son for his acne. It lessened his acne. Then he stopped using it. He will learn. Great product for the price and NO PERFUMES."

I've been using this as a first step for my skincare and it has helped immensely. My skin is so dry and inflamed 75% of the time, and this has added hydration and ""bounce"" to my skin. The downside is that it has a very sticky consistency and pills like CRAZY. By the time you're done with moisturizer and makeup, you see whitish residue from pilling on your face and de-pilling is messy. It's fine for your night time routine, but cannot incorporate this during the day because of all the pilling."

It does have a bit of a sticky texture but not so much and I have not experienced any pilling. I think it works best when mixed with other products instead of applying it by itself.

I notice it most when I'm wearing makeup oddly. My tinted moisturizer goes on much more smoothly and has a more refined finish. My face is also very soft to the touch now. It feels very drying around my mouth, so I avoid that area. Pretty pleased with it so far."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,The product has a sticky consistency but once applied to your face and patted it does go away.

I have tried several of their products, and the best things I like about them is their affordable prices and quality. This serum is thick but lightweight, and absorbs fairly quickly while leaving a smooth layer on top. I use it every night before bed, and I wake up every morning with my skin feeling super soft, hydrated, and plump. This has been great for combating dry skin in the winter, and to fix my skin barrier after using exfoliating products and other harsher products. Definitely would recommend, it gives you glassy skin that you will love!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not greasy but moisturizing. Worth every penny.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best serum for dry skin no breakout loved it
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff is really great if you have oily or acne prone skin because chances are (if you do), you're not using an adequate moisturizer (it's so hard to find a decent moisturizer when you have acne prone and/or oily skin!!!). I use moisturizer, but the ""moisturizer"" I use in the AM isn't a very good moisturizer and mostly works as an SPF... That's where this stuff comes in. It can plump up and moisturize your skin without making you oily, irritating your skin, or breaking you out. I really love it!

I like to mix a couple drops with my B3 serum and apply it FIRST, before anything else. You only need a little or it will pill up. These days, I usually apply moisturizer/spf and a couple drops of The Ordinary Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% Antioxidant 1 fl oz / 30ml afterwards (the resveratrol helps keep my skin clear).

I usually purchase this on DECIEM's site because I buy other products there too but I purchased it here this time because it was the only thing I was ordering and (as usual) DECIEM was ""experiencing a high volume of orders"" etc and I didn't want to wait a week for it (even when they're not swamped with orders it takes a week).

The price on amazon fluctuates constantly but that day, it was definitely more expensive here on amazon but I had gift credit here and wanted 2 day shipping so it worked out in that case. I think it's $6.95 on DECIEM but when you include shipping (which is over $5 from what i remember) it might not be that much cheaper than amazon (again, the price fluctuates here).

ETA: I started using the O's The Ordinary Buffet 30ml a while ago (love it SO MUCH) and it seems worth mentioning that if you're looking for something with more antioxidants (or ""anti-aging"" properties) than this 2% hyaluronic acid serum Buffet is worth trying. It's got hyaluronic acid too, but it's also got a bunch of peptides and slightly more moisture (of course this also creates more potential to irritate and clog pores but I don't seem to get any problems from these products because they're so stripped down)."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited until I'd been using this two months before posting, as it takes 6-8 weeks for new skin cells to emerge. I see a definite, significant improvement in fine lines, not only on my face, but on my hands, where I also applied it. Do note:

• It is NOT a moisturizer. Reviewers who complained it left their skin dry were obviously not using hydrating products after applying hyaluronic acid. Unless your skin is very oily, use a moisturizer with any hyaluronic acid product.

• As with any topical skincare product, you should try it on a small patch of skin first to see how you react. Mild tingling is normal. If your skin truly burns, you're sensitive or allergic and should discontinue use.

• Tips for use: apply to skin and gently stroke until the product is absorbed. It may feel tacky at first: that's normal. Keep massaging lightly until the tackiness is gone, about 1 minute. Then apply a moisturizer. And give it time: it takes 6-8 weeks to see results because it takes that long for new skin cells to emerge.

I'm about to order my second bottle. Use it correctly and be patient: it does work."

I do wish that it had a pump bottle because I accidentally spilled some tettering it on my bed when doing my nightly routine. At first I had to use 3 drops and now only 2. My skin has responded in ways I hadn't thought of. All of my face is smoother, acne more under control, products go on smoother and I need less of them as well. My skin tone in more even, less reddish pink from current and past acne. I use it first after washing and then my eye balm directly after. I usually wait 5 minutes to apply other products over it. I can also use a lightweight moisturizer like Trader Joe's and not a heavier night cream...nice to only have to deal with one moisturizer. This is a hands down no brainer.

I have noticed my fine lines easing and even disappearing in places, I don’t need a strong moisturizer- just a light daily one with sunscreen. People believe I’m younger than I really am, it has even helped the lines on neck and décolleté. My makeup applies more smoothly, and I need less now than I used to— especially if I use primer, which allows it to last all day. I highly suggest this serum for everyone even in their 20s and older, it works! Thank you, The Ordinary!!"

IF YOUR SKIN IS DRY OR YOU LIVE SOMEWHERE DRY YOU NEED TO APPLY THIS TO A DAMP FACE, OR YOUR SKIN WILL BE A MESS. this is a humectant and it pulls moisture from the air around you, if it’s not humid where you are it will pull it from your skin. When you wet your face; it will retain the moisture **This has completely changed my skin. I have great skin normally and I thought it wouldn’t make a difference. But holy **** was I wrong! My skin looks even better! I normally wash, exfoliate, essence, serum, moisturizer, target concentrates and eye cream. Adding this as my serum has made such a difference in retaining moisture.

The price point is great and the product is now something I can’t do without! People who don’t much about this acid complain about it being sticky. It’s supposed to be. Pat it into your skin instead of rubbing. You don’t need a lot. It works best on a damp face so I always use a mist before applying it. You’ll look a little shiny after applying it but it goes away after you put on your other products. I wait about 5 minutes before applying my other creams over it. I pat on my lotions afterwards too because it’s still a bit sticky. That goes away too though! I do wish the bottle was bigger because you use it morning and night.

I do have combination oily skin, and I work around a lot of grease and in the heat. My face isn't too shiny after working 10 hours after using this when I wake up. I'll continue to use it and buy it again once I get low.

Updated: Tried using the ordinary's natural moisturizing factors + HA with this, and while it didn't pill on me, the moisturizer wasn't suited for my skin type, so I broke out. I have a separate review on that product."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this product! I use this along with the Niacinamide and a moisturizer. It works great! I have been dealing with hormonal acne for 2 years. Nothing worked. But, OMG, I have been using this for about 6 months and my face is completely clear of acne and almost all of the scaring/hyperpigmentation is gone! I began seeing results within a week or 2. Will never go without this in my regimen."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, this is the real deal. Finally a skin care product I can tell works and I now buy regularly. My skin literally drinks this in like a sponge in a puddle of water. A dime-sized drop of this covered my entire face and was immediately absorbed. Works beautifully and easily in my facial regimen."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have oily skin and recently learned that oily skin produces even more oil when skin is dry.

I started looking around at expensive brand facial care and noticed that the hyalurinic acid was a common ingredient. Upon further research I learned that this ingredient is good for all skin types.

This has been a miracle product at a phenomenal price. I use my normal skin care routine, and put on this serum under my moisturizer. I have used it for about two months now and have noticed a difference in breakouts. Additionally, my skin is smoother and seems brighter.

I’m so glad I tried this product before shelling out $100+ on trying a different skin care line!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can definitely tell the difference since I have started using this. I actually need to purchase another bottle. This came recommended to me and I wasn't too sure but ordered it any way. I am stuck now. I deal a lot with dark spots, oily skin, hormonal acne and I must say. My skin is much more even and toned, and I have a bit of a glow. I'm not one sold on makeup and natural face is my go to majority of the time. Now don't get me wrong, I've only been using this for some time, but so far I think I like it."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely wonderful product. Pro tip I learned in beauty school: apply to damp face, so it has water to ""bind"" to. After I wash my face, I don't dry, then spray with some diluted lavender oil water. Then I apply this.

This is my entire Skincare routine, and my skin has really improved. Hyaluronic acid helps healing and as such has helped my hormonal acne I've developed after having a baby and from my birth control. I've noticed a difference in just two weeks.

As for the price, it would be about the same on their website if you include shipping, and it would come slower than via Amazon prime, so I will continue to purchase through Amazon."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve been researching HA and struggling to know what is best. Prices are all over the place for HA. I saw this one and decided to try it. Noticed my face was plumper overnight!! For the price I don’t think I could have found better!!
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like how my skin feels with this. I like to put it on then do a facial steam or spray some rose water onto my face. It does like pill? So I DEFINITELY would not put makeup on over this. Make sure you are moisturizing enough so your skin doesn’t dry out. Also the texture, it’s kinda like water downed glue? Overall I like this product."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this once or twice daily after using a mist on my face and arms and décolletage. Appears to be non-irritating and helps a somewhat with crepey skin.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and performance of this hyaluronic acid 2%. A friend recommended the company to me because I have been looking for good skincare since surgical menopause ravaged my skin. The simple packaging is how the company keeps it's cost so low without compromising any quality whatsoever. In the makeup and skincare industry, a lot of the price jacking is due to the amount the company spends on premium luxury packaging. The fact that I can buy the same quality in a simple and very effective glass dropper bottle means I get more product for every penny spent. 100% worth the cost and I will be faithfully ordering this product for as long as it's available!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this stuff! It’s part of my skincare routine, and it hydrates my face so well without leaving a pasty residue or anything!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I break out from almost every moisturizer I’ve tried. This is the only product I’ve found that keeps me moisturized without breaking out. And it’s unmatched at this price.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical about trying yet another product but I read about this in an article and thought I'd try it gicen the price and I'm glad I did. My skin was dehydrated and needed help. It was rough to touch and looked dry with makeup. I've only used this for about 5 days but so far it has been a gamechanger. My skin is so soft and has a glow. I've spent over $150 on another product that didn't make a difference but this one is amazing. The best part is the price. I would definitely recommend to anyone needing hydration.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I mix it with my Ilibof Olay moisturizer and my face and neck thank me!
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It seems like it made a difference, but if applied by itself, it makes a film that peels. That needs to get washed, because it flakes. Why not using a carrier that IS a moisturizer and this way it would be a powerful moisturizer that does not make a film on the skin?"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great moisturizer. I found out recently it is very important to put a moisturizer over top of it so you dont lose moisture. I think my skin is fairly sensitive. I have not had any issues. I make sure that applied less initially than the recommended 2 drops and then built up slowly. You can layer it with other skin care products, I use it just before my moisturizer which is the last thing I apply."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this serum. I used to use the Neutrogena hydro-boost water gel but found that it was just too expensive. I use this serum after washing my face and before I put on moisturizer. It has done wonders for my skin! I have oily-acne prone skin and I use a salicylic acid wash in the morning and a retinol cream at night, both of which can dry my skin out. Using this along side moisturizer cancels out this effect. I'm already on my third bottle, and would definitely recommend."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hello, I love all of the ordinary products and it shows in my skin, You have a customer for life ❤️"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I spare no expense on my skin, so when I heard about Ordinary hyaluronic acid I thought, why not see if there's a way to save a little money on one product. If it doesn't work, no great loss. After reading the reviews and watching some YouTube videos, I ordered a couple of bottles. Blown away by the results after using this! The hydration is amazing. There's no reason for me to try another brand that costs $60-$90. This is a permanent addition to my skin care routine."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Where do i start! This stuff literally transformed my skin. I have been suffering from serious cystic acne for about 6 weeks now. I've really tried everything to get it to go away with no luck. Anyways i saw this product on a buzzfeed post and decided to order and try it. I got it on Sunday and it's currently Tuesday and i have only 1 remaining pimple left from 5 or 6. The rest of my complexion is smooth and soft. I probably use a little more then suggested on the back, but my skin loves it!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"it's worth it I've been using it for a year and I always buy it here and it arrives perfect, real consistency."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this brand I have tried several others and for the price this is good. It hydrates and seems to help my skin retain moisture. I always put mine on when face is damp or I damped my fingertips and apply it that was I am able to wear it under makeup this way as it is thick. I also us a primer for my make up so I have had no issues using this product during the day. I let it dry in and apply moisturizer and am very happy with purchase and results.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great on my face, I’ve noticed a huge difference since I’ve started to use it. I also use it on my elbows as they tend to get dry quick and I’ve noticed a huge difference! Something I suggest people to do to help with the “sticky” is add a few drops of water to the serum while it’s in your hands and rub together. Seriously works like a charm and on my opinion helps it soak moisture in."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This totally changed my face for the better. Moisturizers alone still left dry, patchy places; adding this was a game-changer, right from the first application. It's a much better value than the high-priced, big name companies, and it works beautifully. I highly recommend it."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of my family members bought this, and I guess it was good. They didn't complain about it."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have T-zone skin so moisturizing can be tricky. I only need a couple of drops of this to make my skin feel perfect! I use the argireline solution, then the hyaluronic acid 2%+b5, then finally the matrixyl 10%+HA. It takes just moments to do all of this, after washing your face of course. It literally only takes a few drops of each of these. This is the best anti-aging line I have found. Great results, very reasonably priced!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value for the cost. The stuff does what all hyaluronic serums do, keeps and adds hydration. And I dont feel like I'm losing any hydration as the day goes either. You only need a couple of drops for the entire face. What I will say is that there is a sticky/tacky feeling as you pat it into the akin, but not uncomfortable and as you layer products or just as you go through the day, the feeling goes away."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently bought the AHA ordinary product as a chemical peel and needed some more moisture to my face after the use, and it has helped me so much!! I use once morning and night, after showering after cleansing my face. Not sticky, and actually can be used as a primer for makeup and allows the makeup to not be super cakey! I love this and will definitely continue using!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this product, and used under my daily moisturizer and sunscreen and at night under my vitamin C and retinol, seems to work for my not young skin. The only thing is the price. The amazon seller was double the price of local stores. Still reasonably priced, but when you can buy it in the store for a little over $6.... My Ulta doesn’t carry in store so here I am."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The bottle came undamaged, and the serum is the same as the one I got from Sephora a couple of months ago, as far as I can tell. It feels super hydrating on my skin and I love to put it on after a shower. Works great!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"48 year old skin. After reading an article by a dermatologist, I've been using this and alternating between Skinceuticals 1% retinol cream and a retinol serum from here on Amazon. I am very pleased with the results. I can see my marionette lines are much less prominent. This looks so much better than having surgery. A very cost effective solution to maintain a beautiful face."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The box it came in was torn up so I was a little skeptical. It does go on tacky, but it soaked into my skin well and didn’t leave a tacky residue of any sort. (The directions do say to use it before your creams to lock it in. Although I don’t all the time and it still doesn’t leave residue.) It’s my understanding that hyaluronic acid draws out moisture from the environment you live in so it might not be as affective in a dry climate-I live in a humid climate."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love The Ordinary. The hyaluronic acid, retinol, and ferulic acid are must haves in my skincare routine. My skin has seen a reduction in fine lines, improved skin tone, and a dewiness I didn't have before. If you are looking to get these products, don't buy off Amazon. You get a better price and bigger bottles through The Ordinary directly. Shipping with them will take one week however."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of my absolute new favorite products! I have dry, dehydrated combination skin. So, getting hydration in the right places can be tricky as I have oily spots elsewhere. This product (which is extremely affordable) allows me to nourish only the necessary locations on my face (like cheeks). This product has allowed me to purchase other cheaper drugstore creams as those products are no longer as necessary for hydrating my face. I give it an A++!"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my 3rd bottle and I've given away 2 as gifts. It's just reliable, glides on and does what it's supposed to. Sometimes, because I'm in Vegas I pat in a little bit of water or mist my face to add a bit of moisture since I'm in a dry climate. It captures moisture from the air so bear in mind before you leave the mirror, after it dries on."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Multi-Depth Hydration Serum for Plumper, Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid as well as all the other products they have!

It has helped the dryness on and around my nose since adding this serum to my routine."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,1.0 out of 5 stars,I have had this product for a while. So I begin to use this daily and the first few days I’m like okay. Around day 7 I began to notice my under eye place was twitching. And it’s in the area I placed the serum. So I thought nothing of it and continue to use until I noticed my twitching didn’t go anywhere. So I stopped just to see if it would go away as this was annoying at times. And after 2 days I was back to normal. So I began to use it again and within a day my eye part was twitching. I discontinued use and no more twitching. I didn’t use a lot of product. So it’s a no for me

I did a patch test on my forearm for 24 hours and nothing bad happened, So I did the next night to try it on my eye contours. When I woke up I had even bigger dark circles under my eyes and puffier eyes. The next day I decided to not use this product at all and the dark circles got smaller and less noticeable. Yesterday night I tried using this product again and the same thing happened, I have terrible-looking eyes , huge dark circles and my eyes are puffy. This is the last time I ever use this product!"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sorry to say but this is an extremely poor product. It has dried out the under eye area and my eyelids and as a result I've got wrinkly skin on my lids and has aged my eyes. I had very high hopes after reading the reviews and although it had got only 3 stars, I thought I could give it a try after reading some positive reviews. It was the worst decision as earlier I had only puffy eyes, but now I have extremely dry, wrinkly and itchy lids too. I had used this product religiously for a month hoping for some positive changes, but instead my skin became dry and itchy and eventually wrinkly. I don't understand why this product is highlighted as Amazon's Choice!"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,1.0 out of 5 stars,I waited a month to post this review hoping to see any change . But there was none. Does nothing at all to help with undereye circles.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Did absolutely nothing, just a jell type product. Horrible! The worst part, it is non-returnable. A bunch of hype. Save your money.."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This item leaked through the lid and I was unable to open the bottle. Even if I could open it, it would not be safe to use. Buyers BEWARE"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is probably one of the worst eye treatments that I have ever used. It's a waste of time & money. The only good thing is that it does moisturize the eye area. But it didn't help minimize lines or dark circles. Try something else!
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know someone else, but for me he didn't do anything, I threw it away after I didn't see any results. I didn't like it 👎🏼"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,1.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve used this as directed for over a month and have seen zero difference. In fact it seems to make my eyes more puffy. I would not recommend this product.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,1.0 out of 5 stars,Product came like this photo to me. Looked like it leaked out and dried on the outside of bottle. Probably missing half of it
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product dries my skin and made the area under my eyes darker… me look like a raccoon smh
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"After 3 months of steady use, I have not experienced any reduction in the texture or fullness of the bags under my eyes. The serum feels nice to apply and then smooth in. After application it's a little sticky for awhile but that's fine. The caffeine may be working to constrict the blood vessels somewhat because the skin under each of my eyes does appear lighter (I'm naturally quite pale). This might be the cause of the ""brightening effect"" others have reported. However, this change is not significant enough to overcome the fact that the product does nothing to reduce the puffiness and bulges of the eyebags."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t notice much of a difference when using. Did however notice the shiny sticky residue on my eye lids and under my eye. Almost amplified the puffy and dark circles. Gave it 2 stars instead of one cause at least it doesn’t smell bad or sting lol.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,My dark circles are a little inflamed. I have been using this product to help me but I haven't seen any changes since I bought it
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m pretty sure I have hereditary under eye bags, and their pretty dark. I have tried everything from cold compress green tea bags, to icing underneath my eyes, and a honey turmeric mix mask and nothing seems to help. I also sleep 8-9 hours every night, drink between 65-100 ounces of water every day, and eat pretty well. A friend mentioned to me that maybe I should try a caffeine serum so I found this. The price was alright but after 2 weeks I haven’t seen any sort of change. I did as the directions instructed and used it twice a day every day. Some products work for some and not others so I’m not upset."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I threw this away because it burned my eyes. There was no moisturizing at all. Understand that moisturizing wasn't the big selling point of this product but still is an eye product. Too many eye products out there to choose one that burns, Personal experience I guess."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,The product somehow had good reviews. I used it for 3 weeks 2×/day with NO sign of any change in bags under eyes. It's also non-returnable. Either save your money or put it towards a better product.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,I honestly don't understand how there can be so many 5-star reviews unless these people didn't really have much puffiness or very dark circles. I have used almost the whole bottle and see no difference. I am 68yo with good skin and no wrinkles but my undereye bags drive me crazy to the point of not wanting my picture taken unless I am wearing sunglasses. Part of me is very disappointed but part of me is not surprised... so much hype for The Ordinary products. Maybe I'll try putting some coffee grounds under my eyes and see what happens. 😉
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't like the consistency compared to another one I had bought, I had my doubts that it was original, so don't use it."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know.... it's cheaper than most products advertising to reduce under eye puffiness and dark circles, but it didn't really do anything noticeable. I used it for a couple of weeks and didn't see any diffence. I bough another (non-caffeine) product that was twice as much money, but I actually works. Maybe this one will work for you, but it did nothing for me."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am still waiting for an improvement after using half the bottle. My under-eyes are as puffy and dark as ever.

I'm 55 and the area I put it on feels tighter but the bags are still profound.

Can’t use."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I used this product for an entire month and saw no difference under my eyes except softness. The only good thing is you only have to use a little, the bottle last for a long time. So u get your money's worth as far as how long it last."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was hoping this product would help me to reduce dark circles but after 2 months of use twice a day I see no difference.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I used this for about 5 days. I saw no improvement but, more importantly, on the 5th day one of my eyes started itching intensely and was simultaneously painful. I discontinued use but now on my second day of not using it my eye is still itchy and painful (although less so). I did not purposely put the product in my eye but at some point some must have gotten in it. Be very careful with this product."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased this product because I saw all the hype about it on YouTube then I came here and saw all the before and after pics and I decided to give it a go. I didn’t see a difference with Two weeks of wearing it. In fact if I look closely in my under eyes I can see my skin got dried up because of this oil
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is nice, just doesn't work for me. It was incredibly drying for my skin."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted this product to work. It’s a thin oil that comes out in a dropper. When I put it on my lower eye area, it dried up like a piece of plastic. It burned my eyes. I tried it the next morning, same result. Returned."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Sadly I had an allergic reaction to this product and crossing my fingers that the welts, redness and swelling go down soon (it’s been 3 days of no use now and not gone yet). I can’t leave a bad review as it may have simply just been me but I would highly recommend testing 1st before trying just to be safe."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the most drying product I have ever put on my face. Turned my eyes into a crepey mess and my under eyes into the Sahara desert. I have no idea if there was any depuffing, as I was too busy dealing with the SOS state of my skin. I would not recommend."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very excited to use it as the main purpose was to disappear as much as I could the stains under my dark circles, but when using the product I went on the contrary, my dark circles became darker: (and I am of a dark complexion, I think it was not the ideal product for ME."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,I was excited to finally try this product as I have heard so many good things about these products. Unfortunately this did nothing for my skin. I was bummed. Everyone’s skin is different so I would say for the price it is worth trying. I will most likely try other products in the line.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,I am a man over 50. I have used skin care since I was 23. This product worked better on my mouth laugh lines than on my eyes. I use Kiehl's eye gel for men. Which I highly recommend. I had to put that over this to even make any difference. I would pass this up - if you have something that works. Don't always trust the so called YouTube beauty influences.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had bags under my eyes since my early fifties.

Live and learn. Let the buyer beware."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have hereditary bags. I’ve used a lot of products to try and at least depuff them but nothing has worked. Saw the reviews for this and got excited but ended up disappointed in the end.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,3.0 out of 5 stars,I tried this product and unfortunately it was irritating to my eyes. I'm sure this isn't true for everyone so it may work for most people. Please be aware though that it is not returnable to Amazon as are most products are. I'm not sure why this is and if this is only for all Ordinary products but it's something to be aware of when purchasing.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,3.0 out of 5 stars,Product was not sealed. So I was afraid to use.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It drys white, like Elmer's glue on skin, so only good under makeup.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff works great, BUT IT BURNS. And I don't just mean I'm dumb and got it IN my eye (I am and I have)...I mean, I put it on before bed and sleep all night, wake up in the morning and rub my eye a little bit and all of a sudden I'm blind and weeping like I got maced by the cops. I wish so bad it didn't do that because it really did lighten my racoon circles in about a week!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m not really sure if my expectations were just too high or what, but I don’t really see much of anything from this stuff... it goes on smooth, it does leave a very sticky residue which disappears if you apply moisturizer on top of it, it feels refreshing when I put it on, but I just don’t see any results... maybe I need to use it for a while to notice any difference...?"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure this product works. I have used it for quite some time and see no difference in puffiness.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,3.0 out of 5 stars,It was weird. Reduced puffiness somewhat but left a weird residue. I found it very drying and not at all moisturizing. Doesn't live up to it's hype.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This works as a sort of general anti-aging serum in that it reduces some puffiness and tightens the eye area. (It does feel noticeably tighter.) As far as reducing dark eye circles, my primary goal, it's a dud. I've come to realize that I probably just have deep-set eyes and nothing short of dermal fillers will make a difference. I don't think I'll buy another bottle. Truthfully, the before-and-after photos here on Amazon don't look much different to me, either. I think there's a placebo effect happening for some."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,3.0 out of 5 stars,It feels cool and tight on the skin but haven't noticed any difference yet after a couple of weeks of consistent use.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,3.0 out of 5 stars,Very sticky. Definitely cannot be worn under makeup. Not sure how much it actually helps. If I wake up with puffiness I'll apply this upon waking and before I shower then wash it off after an hour or so and apply makeup. Perhaps I'm using it wrong or it doesn't really work
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,3.0 out of 5 stars,Received the product (delivery was 5 star) but when i opened the package the actual box for product seemed to have been tampered with and the serum was already opened and half of it leaked out and on the sides... very disappointed.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,3.0 out of 5 stars,I wouldn’t necessarily buy this for fine lines or crows feet. It does perk up your eyes but they feel somewhat dehydrated when I use this. I don’t think there’s long term scientific evidence that using caffeine around the eyes is any good.

I didn’t have any bad reactions or experience with it but just nothing outstanding about it either. Like nothing was noticeable if I used it one day and didn’t the next. So I don’t think I’ll repurchase but it was worth a try. It’s a good amount of product for the price and you don’t need a lot of it so it lasts a long time.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,4.0 out of 5 stars,I use this a few times a week and I feel like it’s a good product. As a male that has natural dark circles it took a while to notice a difference (likely because I don’t use a lot). I would use daily but I get dry skin on my eyelid region and when this is applied to that the burning is INTENSE.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I won't say (like some other reviews I read) that it totally resolved the issue; however, at my age, I believe it is doing a good job of alleviating some of the puffiness and lightening some of the dark circles. My only complaint is that I have to place it strategically. If I get it too near the outer corner of my eye, it starts itching."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the product so far. I’ve tried every eye cream known under the sun to get minimize dark circles (allergic shiners), and this is the only one that seems to do anything. In 3 days time, I’ve already noticed a significant reduction in puffiness and the dark circles “seem” lighter (I honestly don’t know if they actually are or if the fading is in all in my head; hopefully some of my friends will mention the difference without me asking them).

What I don’t like, however, is the price fluctuation. I bought it for $12 last week; today I went to order a couple more bottles and saw that the cost had risen to $14.99. Is that the way it works—notice that a repeat customer must have had a good experiment when you see your item in his/her cart, and then thank them for their loyalty with an up charge? As much as I like this product, I’m not going to buy it on here if these are the shenanigans being played."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Took one star off for the dropper bottle because I find it awkward to use and messy. Otherwise, this is an excellent product, and you get a LOT of product for your money. Just a simple serum, feels like water going on, but then it gets sticky for a moment as it soaks in. The stickiness completely goes away and after about 2-3 days of consistent twice a day usage I noticed my eyes were way less puffy and the skin appears brighter. I have a brown patch next to one eye and I think it looks lighter already. I just wish they'd package it differently - I travel a LOT and keeping a glass bottle in my travel kit makes me nervous. Plus when traveling there's not always counter space to set it down while using both hands to dispense a drop from the dropper. I will continue to buy this product regardless. Good deal."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So I lusted for this product. I’ve used caffeine facial cleansers and scrubs and they do such a great job on my face overall puffiness I thought it would be better if applied to targeted puffy areas like my eyes. I’ve also very recently found or noticed the dark circles hanging under my eyes like they rain on my nose. So I also wanted something to brighten. From the very first application of this product my eye puffiness decreased. It hasn’t been a week, but one of the most noticeable and immediate changes directly from this product is how the skin under my eye doesn’t itch anymore. It doesn’t feel tight or dry. I don’t feel the urge to rub it, which also aided w/ the puffiness. My expectations so far are being met about this product and I expect with continued use the effects will last."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved this product I think it works, it decreases the appearance of dark circles and bags too much, I don't give it 5 stars because the top of the cover starts to dry but 9/10"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,4.0 out of 5 stars,I would recommend layering this with a moisturizer! I have sensitive skin and this was a little to string. I didn’t see a difference in my skin
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve always had puffy eyes and very thing and darkly pigmented under eye skin. That’s why I bought this but what is weird is that I got a black eye training Jiu Jitsu and since i’ve had them before based on the impact I thought this one was going to be awful.
I applied this serum when I got home from the gym to my already swollen AF eye area, applied day and night consistently. The bruising was the most minimal I’ve had and the puffiness and swelling weren’t there. Random use and rather unscientific testing of them- but happy I tried! It’s also brought down the puffiness i have day to day but hasn’t done much for the discoloration/dark circles."

I have noticed that my eyes don't look quite as tired as before I started using this serum. It slightly smooths out the lines, and gives just a bit of brightness to under my eyes. I also have been using a vitamin C & E serum at nights, and then this in the mornings, but overall I have noticed a bit of a difference. I think for the amount you are paying, it is worth it."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,4.0 out of 5 stars,I got this product to treat puffiness under the eyes. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now. The good news is I started to see a reduction in the puffiness under my eyes within a few days. It has not been substantiall but it definitely helps. The con to this is I’ve noticed my under eyes dryer than usual. Instead of using morning and night I use only at night. To combat the dryness I’ll follow up with ole henriksen eye cream and has seemed to help. If I remember I’ll update. But so far so good!

I would highly recommend this serum; it will last a while, one small drop is end for both eyes and I will definitely purchase again."

Second, I am able to use this solution at night, but it’s too sticky for daytime use under makeup.

Ever... left a review on anything (I’m lazy lol) , but, I felt it was SOOO Necessary to let others know that this stuff is the REAL DEAL. I have tried everything, and I was very skeptical but this TRULY lightens your dark circles (Hallelujah my expensive search is over!) I wanted to literally shout when I noticed that it worked within 10min. I’ve naturally always had dark circles and have used everything from natural ingredients (that you always have to get/keep fresh) to synthetic brightening creams...and THIS WAS THE QUICKEST/MOST EFFECTIVE/CHEAPEST PRODUCT WITH THE BEST LASTING RESULTS! No matter how much rest I get or don’t get this is a miracle worker! It gives your eyes that youthful bright glow. For best results, I use it for my morning and night routine, a little goes a long way so you don’t have to restock often at all! Keep it sealed tight for potency and so that the active ingredients don’t oxidize and you’re all set! I pray this review helps someone like me who has struggled with the insecurities of dark circles for so long, I feel so much more confident now and it’s all because I prayed and took a leap of faith with getting this product, God Bless beautiful people, get your Glow on!

**HYPERPIGMENTATION??** READ BELOW!
Also if you deal with hyperpigmentation (like me unfortunately) getting the Niacinamide, Alpha Arbutin, and Azelic Acid Suspension (by The Ordinary), along with a generic Vitamin C serum and Hyaluronic acid serum, should definitely put your skin on track to recover & brighten from dark spots and dark concentrated pigment areas for sure! Also a generic retinol and safe chemical peeling solution (I use The Ordinary ‘AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution’ and it does greatt) should do great things as well for your skin’s restorative process!

Okay I’m done now lol, God Bless!

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I suffer from bad dark circles. Tried so many products. Waisted so much $$$. This is the only product for me that works. It works great for wrinkles and dark circles. Doesn't erase them completely but makes them less dark. Very happy. Only need to apply a little so bottle lasts a long time.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using this product for years and highly recommend most of the ordinary products. This moisturizes the delicate skin under my eyes, and I don’t have any issues with bags or dark circles."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only been using this for a short time, but for me, it really works. I have puffy undereyes and a tear trough deformity-so I have these sunken, purplish colored 'grooves' under the inner portion of my eyes (a google image search shows it better than I can explain). Plus I have 4 kids, so I just look tired basically all the time. And even if I do get a good nights rest, even that makes my eyes more puffy somehow. This stuff makes me look way less like a zombie and almost like a real person! I haven't noticed any difference in the purplish discoloration but the reduction in puffiness makes the shadows less prominent so it does look less dark.

I definitely see a difference when I DON'T use it, so I don't think it makes any kind of permanent changes. You would have to continually use it to see consistent results. When I apply it, I can definitely feel it-it's not a burning or a stinging, but there is a weird sensation when I use it. It was pretty drying the first couple of times I used it, so now I let it soak in for 15 minutes then add a layer of my moisturizer over the top to combat the dryness."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just received this recently, used it about 4 days.
I’ve got very dark hereditary dark circles....and I can actually see a subtle change! It’s no miracle, but I have tried a ton of products and spent a lot of money to try to minimize my dark circles and nothing ever made a difference!
So I am pretty impressed with this product , it actually works! In four days it has really toned down my dark circles/ they’re still there... but maybe with daily use I can dramatically minimize the darn things! I will definitely keep using- and would recommend this to people like me... born with purpley circles under your eyes, maybe there’s hope? Like I said this is the first product I have EVER used, after I’ve applied and massaged it in, the dark circles have visibly faded to about half of what they were before applying the product. I’m really impressed! Considering I’ve paid $200 for products from dermatologist that didn’t make a visible difference. For the price, you have nothing to lose- so give it a try! I’m glad I did...... and I am going to try more products from this company. I’m impressed : )"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff has worked great in my opinion in both reducing puffiness and eliminating dark circles under my eyes. It is a thick serum, soaks into skin quickly and doesn’t leave anything behind. The Ordinary brand of skincare has great products and their prices are very low compared to the rest of the industry products. I own and use about 6 different products from them."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had been hearing about this stuff for awhile and decided to give it a try. People report a lot of burning to skin and really talk about not leaving on for more than 10 mins. I have used many exfoliating and anti aging products and have spend my share of money . This product does not disappoint! I did not personally have much burning at all but I do recommend trying in for less time at first . My skin is used to these type of products , and I had some mild discomfort for a minute or two. The results are amazing, skin is very soft and dewy. Make sure to use a great hydrating product after"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for something to reduce the occasional eye puffiness that I get when I haven't had enough sleep, or I eat too much salt the day before. My eyes aren't chronically puffy, but I wanted something besides freezing my eyeballs with ice cubes in the morning. I tried a few other creams, and while they kept the eye area soft, they didn't do anything to reduce puffiness. I received a gift card for my birthday this past July from my co-worker, so I purchased this and a few other products from The Ordinary company. I figured now was a good time to try this line since I had a gift card burning a hole in my pocket! This was exactly what I was looking for. It worked to reduce puffiness within 15 minutes, it didn't sting, want sticky, had no fragrance and my makeup went on fine over it. I'm glad I tried it, and I will buy it again when this bottle eventually runs out"

My eyebags have become pretty significant and purpleish. While I've always been skeptical of eye serums, I've been using this product for about a month and I have noticed a difference (and it was not from a change in lifestyle). My undereye is significantly less purple (this is objectively true), and it is less puffy (this one could be subjective). I do not use very much on my eyes, so the price is fairly cheap for how long it will take to get through the bottle. If you are also someone with a big sleep deficit and have dark undereyes, I would recommend this product."

This product is the ONLY way that word would EVER be thrown in my direction!!! It is also working overtime for my eyes because I am breastfeeding and cannot use retinol, and with my track record as previously mentioned, I haven't used retinol ever but feel it would do me some good. This product truly does hide dark circles and bags!!! It will also last FOREVER! A little really goes a long way. I use it 2 times daily, AM and PM. The first few days I may not have noticed any difference, but a couple weeks later I am amazed at the ""dezombification"" effect!"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use this product both in the evening and in the morning. I use it after I I have applied my toner and lactic acid serum from the ordinary. I put this all over my face chest neck and hands. I drink green tea and notice a big difference in my skin when I'm not drinking green tea so having also makes me feel better that I'm working towards improving the look and feel of my skin as well as for aging. I've also included a picture of some of the other products that I use in my skincare routine as a whole. The ponds and oil are only for my hands and chest though
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG, Depuffing Eye Serum for Dark Circles and Tired Eyes",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been using this for 3 years. I've spent less then $25 on 3 bottle of this in that time. (first purchase was through Sephora when it was new and only cost me $4!) I use the smallest drop and tap around my undereye and in a semi circle to just under my browbone. It's made a world of difference and amazes me that something so affordable works AND lasts me a year. It took about 1.5 weeks of continued use to see results and my no makeup self is always please with how much the darkness and puffiness of my eyes are basically gone since I've been using this.

I’m a grad student who works two jobs and runs my own business and I sleep when I can - this stuff makes me look like a fresh faced human and I appreciate it. I only use it once a day, and sometimes skip days because it is a little drying, but with a good moisturizer I have very little problems. My skin type is dry-normal in my undereye."

This product is amazing! I have struggled with dark circles since birth due to pale skin, allergies, and lack of fat under my eyes. I went to my dermatologist to ask about fillers because it’s that bad and she told me to try an eye cream with caffeine. I put this on and 5 minutes later it looked like I’d slept for 5 years.

I have suffered for many years from chronic eyebags that are humongous due to both heredity and illness. This is the first product out of multiple products that I’ve tried that actually does what it says it’s going to do. I was amazed the first 3 days I used it. I knew it wasn’t my imagination when a couple of close friends who knew my health issues asked if I was resting better. When questioned why they thought that, both mentioned that my eyebags and darkness were less noticeable. I want to hug the people who came up with this formulation."

The Ordinary makes excellent products. I have been using Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution for a couple of years and it is amazing. A bottle lasts a very long time. I usually buy from Ulta and the bottle is sealed and authentic. But this time I gave this Amazon seller a try. The bottle cost $5 more and arrived in a partially crushed box, with no seal. There is no odor/frangrance, is not the same color as the original, and the effect on my skin is non-existent. This has been diluted! Too much time out of my life to bother to send it back.

My skin is obviously used to acids, so I decided to try this toner after reading the reviews. I switched to a non-glycolic acid facewash to minimize possible irritation. I wanted to love this toner, but I think my skin may be too used to harsh products because I haven't noticed a difference. My skin doesn't feel stripped afterwards, but I do notice a residue and sticky feeling afterwards. Moisturizer just lays on top and never sinks in."

I used a toner from neutrogena for years untill they changed the formula. It had 2% glycolic acid in it and it worked great, It stung only a little bit, enough for me to know it was working. I also tried some from poractive which worked amazing but it was to expensive. My concern with thinking I must have gotten a bum product is because I'm seeing no results whatsoever and thats not normal because I know glycolic acid works great on my skin. I mean if a 2% acid toner works great than shouldn't I see some kind of results with 7%?? I've also used multiply glycolic peels and I found the strongest one I can stand is a 20% and thats leaving it on for a few minutes and washing it off, so I was concerned that 7% might be to much for everyday use.I'd might as well be putting water on my face. Needless to say I was very disapointed. If I order anything else I'll order from the ordinary website. Hopefully that was the problem cause I wanted to like this brand."

I have found The Ordinary has some amazing products to help feed these kind of spots one of them being this product, glycolic acid at this level and percentage is a little bit severe for sensitive skin, and I recommend only using it at night and to wear sunscreen the following day, as it is a stronger percentage, however the 3 out of 5 starts it's mainly from the fact that the seller was charging $19, which admittedly I was not paying attention to when I purchased it. The product itself goes for $13 on the company's webpage and at Sephora so just keep that in mind."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, Brightening and Smoothing Daily Toner for More Even-Looking Skin Tone",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace my Pixi Glow Tonic, which has is 5% glycolic acid. Thought that the Ordinary would have better ingredients and value. I have oily skin with occasional hormonal acne and whiteheads. I don't consider my skin sensitive, but I try to use simple soothing products to protect my skin barrier.

It stung when I used it for the first time, swiping it on with a cotton pad about 3x a week. Due to the higher level of glycolic acid than I'm used to, I thought that over time I would get used to it, but I started breaking out, getting bigger painful acne and small bumps. Thinking I was just purging, I continued to use it for about 4-5 weeks, but I got more painful acne, and decided it wasn't worth in. When I stopped using it, my skin returned to normal and the painful acne went away.

Because a ton of people like it, I'd say give it a shot. It just didn't work for me."

I used this product every other day as it suggests but even with every other day I felt like it was super harsh on my skin and causing breakouts. I switched from this product back to another toner that is made with less harsh chemicals and it did better for my skin than this did. I don’t consider myself to have sensitive skin either, but this toner definitely isn’t for everybody.

I also didnt like how it’s not a spray bottle and instead something you have to have a cotton pad or something to wipe with, because I feel like that can cause so much waste."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, Brightening and Smoothing Daily Toner for More Even-Looking Skin Tone",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m embarking on a journey with slightly cheaper skincare (which is not ideal considering my peri-menopausal, ageing and changing skin but the economy in the UK is what it is). Anyway, I bought this some months back as a much cheaper alternative to dermalogica, and a slightly cheaper alternative to pixi vitamin c toner.
I’ve not been disappointed but it’s too astringent on my skin. It shouldn’t be used as a regular twice daily toner. Maybe on younger skin but not on changing, ageing skin. As a 20 something I’d have loved this compared to my Clinique regimen for its value.
I like to know my cleanser has done its job and I have used exfoliates weekly, regularly for years but this alone is too astringent for the winter and for sun exposed skin in my opinion and at my age.
Overuse promoted breakouts and excess oils to be produced. And I was stuck having either well exfoliated and almost glowing skin (over producing oils to repair) with flaky, oily breakouts or dull dry skin.
I’ve still got loads left and try to avoid using it on my face unless I have an oily hormonal breakout I want to dry up.
My teenager suffers from some back acne and occasionally around their shin and mouth and a few days sweeping this over their skin does help to dry things up."

Thank God, thank God, thank God,
first of all, except for a certain point in your face. Then I don't answer Eid in yourself. The
important thing is that I used it on sensitive areas and leave it only 3 times a week because its concentration is considered weak and safe, but We have to take care that we should not be executed and destroyed, right??
Use it at night and the second wet day after you wash the
product. I have no doubt.
Thank you to the seller"

Be mindful to use it in the evenings only!!! It's an acid and can cause sensitivity on the skin. During the days, avoid the use and ALWAYS WEAR A SUNSCREEN!!!!
Never use on broken or irritated skin (it adds on irritation).
Can use it daily. However, if sensitivity persists, recommended to use 2 - 3 times a week ( PM ) !!!!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, Brightening and Smoothing Daily Toner for More Even-Looking Skin Tone",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This toner has been a game-changer for both my skin and hair. For my skin, it gently exfoliates, leaving my complexion brighter, smoother, and more even. I’ve noticed fewer blemishes and fine lines. For my scalp, I’ve been using it as a mild exfoliant—helping to reduce buildup and improve texture without irritation.

Start slow if you have sensitive skin, as it can be potent. Overall, an excellent multitasking product that improves both skin and scalp health—just be sure to apply sunscreen for extra protection!"

I only use it a handful of times and I believe I would see a giant difference if I used it more regularly. Unfortunately, I can’t get into the habit of it and I am lazy and not getting it used daily. If you can focus and use this every day, I feel like it would probably be a great product! As for me, it is currently sitting under my sink and I am not receiving any of the benefits."

Not a product to use during the daytime or to be used every day. It will irritate your skin if used too often, learned that the hard way.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, Brightening and Smoothing Daily Toner for More Even-Looking Skin Tone",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I could hardly believe it when I saw the price on a 7% glycolic, so I was excited to try this. Overall, I rate this product good, not great. I get clogged pores in the crease of my nose and I'm in the middle of a well-coordinated attack on melasma, so glycolic is essential to my routine. This toner did a great job keeping my pores clear and it did provide exfoliation - just not to the extent other brands at a 7% concentration did. If you're looking for some light, surface level skin care or preventative skin care, this is a good product for you. If you are looking to combat deeper skin issues, you might want to kick it up a notch with a higher quality product. I use this toner twice a day without any irritation or peeling, but more sensitive skin might react poorly to so much use."

I have an oily T mark combination skin type. And I kid you not, the first time I used it. I felt a major difference on my face, I felt less oily and just over all fresh. It may sting a little at first but you barely even notice it. Within a week, along with other skin care products, it helped reduce any future sebum provoked acne breakouts and does a great job at preventing them! Recommend it!"

I love it and it's drastically reduced black heads and made my pores smaller. Make sure to slowly work this into you routine starting one-two nights a week. If you have sensitive skin, it might burn. If it's overly painful, stop. Your skin cannot tolerate it. Be aware this is a chemic exfoliant. Only use at night. Follow with sunscreen in the morning ALWAYS.

OTHER THAN THAT, ANOTHER GREAT ORDINARY PRODUCT."

In conjunction with the glow, it's also made my skin smoother. The pores have also decreased in size and I have fewer blackheads. Recently though my diet has not been great and I broke out, so don't think this will cover acne that results from poor health"

I have always used the pixi glow glycolic toner that only has 5% glycolic acid. I do notice the difference in the higher percent acid in the ordinary one.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, Brightening and Smoothing Daily Toner for More Even-Looking Skin Tone",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using Glycolic Acid from The Ordinary brand for a while and have had a mixed experience in my search for more radiant and smoother skin. Here are my pros and cons:

Pros:
1. Skin renewal: Glycolic Acid has been shown to be effective in exfoliating and renewing the skin. With continued use, I have noticed an improvement in my skin texture and a reduction in the appearance of small imperfections and enlarged pores.

2. Ease of use: The solution-like presentation makes the application simple. It's easy to incorporate into my skincare routine, and only a small amount is needed to cover my entire face.

3. Affordable Price: The Ordinary is known for offering high-quality products at affordable prices, and Glycolic Acid is no exception. It's a cheaper option compared to other similar treatments on the market.

Cons:
1. Initial sensitivity: At first, I experienced a slight redness and burning after application. This is common with products that contain glycolic acid, but can be an inconvenience for those with sensitive skin.

2. It can be strong for some: As I increased the frequency of use, I noticed that my skin became more sensitive and, at times, I experienced dryness and peeling. It is important to be careful when adjusting the frequency of use according to individual skin tolerance.

3. Variable results: While I have seen improvements in my skin texture, the results can be variable. Some may notice more drastic changes than others, depending on their skin type and specific needs.

In short, Glycolic Acid from The Ordinary is a skin care product that offers promising results in terms of skin renewal and improved texture. However, it is important to take into account the individual sensitivity of the skin and adjust the use accordingly. If you're willing to experiment and consider potential initial side effects, this product could be a valuable addition to your skincare routine."

It leaves your skin softer and helps you improve its appearance making it look healthier and brighter... I LOVED it and would definitely buy it again.

Another fact is that they can use it to lighten their darker areas and make them look prettier, it is not suitable for very sensitive skin as it can irritate the area."

I read on a website that toners with acid can help a lot--apply it once a week in areas that sweat and you'll be happy with the results since it helps odor control A LOT. I'm happy to report it totally works, and made it so even if I get sweaty, I'm not stinky (unless it's been 2 workouts in a row or something)."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, Brightening and Smoothing Daily Toner for More Even-Looking Skin Tone",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have huge pores. Forget Uber. Just climb into one of my massive pores and I’ll take you anywhere you need to go. HUGE pores. I’ve tried numerous chemical and physics exfoliants and numerous products to try and minimize my pores but I get stuck with products that don’t work or inflames the surface of my skin which makes my pores look even bigger! Just a little inflammation makes a pore stretch out an look worse. This toner is awesome!! No inflammarion whatsoever and although it seems impossible to notice a difference after 3 days, I absolutely have! I noticed it after I applied my foundation today, my pores looked blurred somehow. No primer used, same product routine as always except for this toner! No irritation or inflammation and my skin feels more hydrated. I use it once a day at night before bed. I’m also experimenting by using this on back of my arms (2x’s per day) instead of glycolic body lotion to see if it helps my KP. Lotions seem to make my problem worse although they are recommended to treat KP. I think this toner may be the answer! My arms are already sooo much softer! So so hopeful!! Highly recommend trying this!"

With other changes I made to my skincare and diet, this is the best my skin has felt and looked since before puberty, and I’m 26.

It also feels more gentle on my skin than Pixi Glow Tonic and I only have to use it once a day, which makes the product last long. I've been using it for 3 weeks now and have only used 1/7 of the bottle. It has faded MONTHS worth of my hyperpigmentation in just 1 week. It is by far the fastest product I've used to fade my marks. It is now one of my skincare holy grails and I am a customer for life! I was recently getting new cystic acne almost every day and nothing was working to combate it. It was leaving huge red marks after it went away that seemed neary impossible to fade. Using this in conjuction with Kate Somerville's Anti-bac, my cystic acne has cleared up by 90%. I am 29 and have struggled with acne for 11 years now. This is the clearest my skin has ever been since developing acne. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for providing this product. It has given me so much of my confidence and happiness back. If you or a loved one is struggling with hyperpigmentation from old acne, I HIGHLY recommend this product."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, Brightening and Smoothing Daily Toner for More Even-Looking Skin Tone",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This toner is exactly what I was looking for. I use this as part if my almost 10 step kbeauty routine. I use 3-4x week at night. It was recommended to me not to use every day and especially not 2x day. After using, my skin is softer, smoother, smaller pores, and overall brighter. The tiny little blackhead bumps/ dull skin are gone. This will sting my skin if I use after exfoliating with a Clarisonic, so I don’t do both in the same routine. Any stinging other than with physical exfoliating is fleeting and dissipates after a few seconds. My other toner I use for the rest of the time is Son & Park beauty water.

I’m a big fan of Charlotte Cho/ Soko Glam and would recommend anyone interested to read The Little Book of Skincare. Since transitioning over to kbeauty products and steps, my skin in clearer, brighter, softer, smaller pores, even tone and very hydrated. People comment on my skin looking really good. I am 36 with normal clear skin. Usually I’ll get one or two pimples around my period but since starting this toner, any zits I get are very small. Don’t forget SPF during the day :)"

I just want to put this out there I wouldn't use this as a daily toner as it is powerful and is more of a chemical exfoliant and in my opinion should only be used maybe two to three times a week at most.. that being said I love this, I double cleaned waited for my face to dry.. and applied.. there was no burning but simply a tiny tingle with I loved and my face did not feel stripped or dryed out there was no tightening of my face and it left a nice glow, I followed it with the Originals H.A. moisturizer love love love the results so far.. Side note DO NOT USE A NIACINAMIDE PRODUCT DIRECTLY AFTER USING THIS, it will cause a chemical reaction and may burn face.."

I have been to the dermatologist and tried multiple things but nothing seemed to really make it go away. In fact, the breakout area on my cheek would sometimes be dormant (past pimples that could possibly become infected again or scars would still be there) but would somehow break out again within a few weeks. I started taking this and not only do I not have breakouts in those areas but everything is completely healing and actually going away. I wish I would have taken before and after pictures to prove it but I had been feeling a bit hopeless about my acne for years. I will never stop using this!

This toner is much better and calmer than Pixi Glow Tonic. The Ordinary acts very calm on skin, although it has 7% of glycolic acid. I feel how my skin exfoliates in just a few days. I have a combination to oily skin type, my mom has a super dry skin, we use the toner together, at night, and it acts super cool on our skins. I would recommend this to everyone, especially in Spring season, when our skin really needs to get rid of dead skin after winter. Just don't forget about SPF cream in the morning, because this acid makes the skin more sensitive.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, Brightening and Smoothing Daily Toner for More Even-Looking Skin Tone",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this after reading that glycolic acid can help remove milia. I had a stubborn milia right next to my tear duct of my left eye for years and thought it wouldn’t go away without surgical intervention. Along with a regimen of deep eye skin moisturizer, rosehip oil, lotion without dimethicone, an exfoliating microdelivery face wash & HUM vitamins for skin, I was able to get the persistent milia off in about a month and a half of consistent use! I was pleasantly surprised and it was worth the try as opposed to getting an expensive medical procedure! Just be extra careful not to get it in your eyes or any sensitive areas. It can sting, so start use gradually maybe every other day or two, then increase amount of nights per week as you see fit."

Helps with acne on my face, and I also began using it as a deodorant replacement. Apparently, glycolic acid reduces the pH in your underarms to prevent bacterial growth, thereby eliminating body odor! - It seriously WORKS (and I can be pretty stinky for a girl, but no stench AT ALL with this). Always wanted a natural deodorant but never could until now because I always smelled (in fact, I normally use clinical strength deodorant). The only thing it does not prevent is perspiration, but that doesn't really bother me since there is no associated smell. Works well for acne too! I use it as a toner at night on my face. Awesome product."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, Brightening and Smoothing Daily Toner for More Even-Looking Skin Tone",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using this product for four days, and already I've seen a huge difference in my skin. I've been dealing with stress-related adult acne on my neck and chest for the past six months, and have tried every product you can imagine. After using this product for such a short time, it's nearly gone. My skin tone also seems more even. I'm working to get rid of some fine age lines, but I have a feeling that may take awhile.

I was really worried about burning/stinging, but would describe the initial application as a mild tingling. Really not bad at all, and it let's you know that it's working! Honestly, I have not experienced any peeling or dryness, but have been following up with my usual skin care routine. I was really hesitant to make this purchase, but I'm so glad that I did. Highly recommended!"

I was tired of using harsh products on my face that after a week of more just made things worse for me. I decided to do my research , hello youtube! I found many videos but I liked the videos from Dr.Dray and there I found a review of this product and how it works wonder when you use it with Retin A. Do not use both products together. I use Retin A one night and then the next night this acid. I'm finally healing and after a week of use I see the dark spots clearing up, my pores reducing and my face is looking younger so fast."

The very very best use of glycolic acid. I love the leave on because it works miracles while I sleep. This is the best acid toner!!!! This transforms my face while I sleep. When you put it on your pores vanish and skin is bright and dewy. When you wake up you will be impressed. I use this at night almost every night unless I use the AHA -BHA peel. I am obsessed with all there acid treatments. I only use ""The Ordinary "" because it is high quality and it is exactly what it says it is. And it is Cheap. I remove makeup then wash with a mild cleanser, I let it dry for about 10min and then apply glycolic acid toner. About an hour later I put the lactic acid on top."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, Brightening and Smoothing Daily Toner for More Even-Looking Skin Tone",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been a fan of glycolic acid for a long time. In my twenties, I sought out acne products that contained glycolic acid to prevent occasional cystic acne. It was then that I realized how much it improved not just the clarity of my skin but also the texture. Now in my thirties, I continue to use glycolic acid to maintain the health of my skin.

This is by far my favorite glycolic acid product. I had a little sensitivity to it in the beginning - it caused some peeling and flaking. This quickly resolved. I use this once a day before applying an spf moisturizer. It has lasted forever. I bought this almost 5 months ago and still have about a quarter of the product left. I will definitely be reordering."

These photos were taken after pretty consistent four (4) months of use every night. My nose has always been my biggest problem area because it was oily, red and I would breakout in that area a lot. It has almost completely cleared up. I get tons of compliments on my skin now, it is not as oily, and the breakdowns are minimal. Best purchase I have made! For reference, I was previously using the Regimen for my skin and birth control which still did not clear up my skin around my nose. I am currently ONLY using the toner and moisturizer (no longer using the Regimen or taking birth control)."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, Brightening and Smoothing Daily Toner for More Even-Looking Skin Tone",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally bought this on the Deciem website, but now they're all sold out. I was pleasantly surprised to see this glycolic acid on Amazon. If you are wondering, YES, it is the real product, it comes in genuine packaging and works/smells/looks exactly like how it should.

If you have dull skin, closed comedones, acne, enlarged pores, or fine lines, THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU! Do not use it without clean skin before, or moisturizing after. Use it at night, or when you won't be in the sun, because it makes your skin more prone to burning. This product is the CHEAPER and more SIMPLIFIED version of Glossier's ""Solution"" liquid toner. You'll basically have glowing skin after a week of using this chemical exfoliant, and it reduces redness and inflammation of my acne in hours."

DO NOT combine with other AHAs or BHAs or any other exfoliants!! Make sure you also moisturize realllyyyyyy well afterwards even if you have oily skin.
I use this 3 times a week (every other day) and use retinol the other days. Never combine the 2 or your skin will be so dry, but alternating the two has helped a lot in getting my acne under control.
Also only use at night!!"

I’m so obsessed.

Specifically this GA toner has been perfect to use after my evening face wash. It brightens, tighten pores, and exfoliates. I have acne proned skin, and I’ve noticed a Very positive shift in my breakouts since using this product. My boyfriend has actually gotten I to using it also."

Not only is it cheaper, I actually now have experienced the miraculous results others had raved about from Pixi!

Does leave a slight stickiness/film, but I consider it an overnight treatment since it specifically says not to wash it off until morning. I moisturize over it and the film is not noticeable."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner, Exfoliating and Hydrating Toner for Smoother, Brighter Skin, 3.4 Fl Oz",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this toner immediately when I first saw it. I was sooooooo excited to try it and had very high hopes… the first couple weeks it seemed to be going ok. After that second week things went south fast. All of a sudden I started getting all these little bumps ALL OVER my face. They were literally everywhere. Thousands of them! I NEVER break out!!!! At first I thought maybe I was “purging” so I gave it another 3 weeks. Now I know that was a big mistake. It never got better, it only got worse. So just beware when using it. Some fermented products can actually trigger fungal acne.

I’ll add that this was the ONLY thing in my skincare routine that was different. I have been using the same products for well over a year now, so I am 1000000000000% sure that this toner was the problem. Once I stopped using it the bumps started to disappear (THANK YOU GOD!)"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner, Exfoliating and Hydrating Toner for Smoother, Brighter Skin, 3.4 Fl Oz",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been using this milky toner for several weeks, and it's become a pleasant addition to my skincare routine. The lightweight, milky texture feels soothing upon application and absorbs quickly without leaving any residue. I've noticed a subtle improvement in my skin's hydration levels, and my complexion appears slightly brighter. However, I haven't observed significant changes in the appearance of dark spots or uneven texture. While it's a gentle option for those with sensitive skin, the results have been modest for me. I appreciate its affordability and the inclusion of beneficial ingredients, but I was hoping for more noticeable improvements."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner, Exfoliating and Hydrating Toner for Smoother, Brighter Skin, 3.4 Fl Oz",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good toner, has a really thin texture and isn't heavy on the skin but is really moisturizing. I agree with the reviews that say it has a yeasty smell but I think this is to be expected given this product is made from yeast. The smell definitely doesn't last and is preferable to artificial fragrance. The moisturizing effect doesn't last all day like you would expect with a cream or barrier which makes this suitable for layering. I wish it came with a pump like some other ordinary products did so that application would be easier but I still would probably get it again"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner, Exfoliating and Hydrating Toner for Smoother, Brighter Skin, 3.4 Fl Oz",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a pretty decent little toner! It's definitely interesting.
Zero scent and leaves zero residue or stickiness. It soaks into the skin quickly!
I will say, the bottle leaves something to be desired because it doesn't dispense as much as I would like.
I have to sit there and shake the bottle a bunch to even get a drop out.
I find that using it with a cotton round is a little easier than my fingers because it is a very watery toner, despite not looking like it would be.
I does leave my skin feeling soft and smooth! Very nice!"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner, Exfoliating and Hydrating Toner for Smoother, Brighter Skin, 3.4 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'll be honest, I've never really understood the need for toner until I tried Ordinary's toner. I have combination skin that lately has been leaning towards more of the oily end of the spectrum. I've also been dealing with some breakouts that I can't get ahead of no matter what I try until I followed up washing with this toner.
After I wash and dry my face, I use a cotton round with this toner and wipe it across my face. While I wouldn't say that it makes my face feel super moisturized, it also doesn't leave it feeling tight and dry either. I also noticed that it does help remove dead skin and other things that are contributing to cloggedpores. I do follow this up with a moisturizer and feel like it helps my skin absorb more than sitting on top of all the gunk that used to get left behind when I was just washing alone.
I am scent sensitive and like that this isn't loaded with perfumes or other scent additives. There is a slight natural milk undertone but it's extremely faint and it's not foul smelling."

It leaves my skin feeling really soft and moisturized. Honestly, I've been using this pretty much only I haven't really been using moisturizer because I feel like this does a good job with moisturizing my skin and my skin does look a lot better like my skin tone looks even and I honestly haven't really been using anything else just this and then sunscreen and that's it and I just washed my face that's that's all I do so I really like this and I would definitely recommend it. I really wasn't expecting much from this product, but honestly, it's really good. I've been using it for like about a month and I haven't really gone through much of it so I would highly recommend this toner."

I have super sensitive combination skin: prone to both acne and dryness. This toner is my favorite toner--it's not at all irritating even to sensitive skin, and it does a good job of helping exfoliate and smooth my skin."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner, Exfoliating and Hydrating Toner for Smoother, Brighter Skin, 3.4 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a nice toner, my facial lady told me to try to switch to more milky cleansers and toners for winter to help with the dryness and irritation. This toner does it all because it's milky and softening but also exfoliating so it helps take off the old skin cells and leave the skin feeling soft and hydrated. Love it just hoping with long term use I don't break out but if that happens I think I'll alternate between my pore cleanser/toner and the milky ones to treat and prevent any pimples but still keep the hydration."

After trying this toner, add me to the fan base. I was legitimately shocked that after one use I actually saw a visual difference in my skin.

I had to touch it because I thought maybe it was still wet, but no, the product had dried and my skin was looking so bright and shiny."

I don't know why even though it says ""milky,"" I didn't expect it to actually look like milk. It absorbs into my skin and doesn't leave behind any residue. As I continue to use it I'll keep an eye out for any reactions and update here if so, but so far it's great!"

Ha! It smells EXACTLY like nigori, and...despite not really drinking alcohol in a long time, I'm now reading up on health benefits of fermented rice drink and plan to order some soon. So, in addition to loving the smell - this made my face feel moisturized in an unusual way. My face glistened almost like I'd applied raspberry oil (or any facial oil) to it. Just heavenly!"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Blemish-Prone Skin and Uneven Texture",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've struggled with congested skin for a long time after years of scrubbing I thought I would try something else and this product has made a big difference. Been using it religiously for six weeks I can see results already. Still working on stubborn areas (like my nose) but the rest of my skin is softer and smoother to the touch and looks better too. The solution is mild and hasn't irritated my sensitive skin. I'll keep going with it and hoping my skin will get better and better.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Blemish-Prone Skin and Uneven Texture",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used the product for at least a month to see the results.
If it has an oily texture, however, the cleansing it has done on my skin is very remarkable. The sticks go away from one day to the next if you apply it at night. The texture, the sticks, have diminished a lot.
I have combination skin and it has worked very well for me, it has not left my skin more oily. I only supplement my routine with other products for combination to oily skin."

Even after a day of using I can see the redness go down and friends have even said my skin looks better.
Only thing to bare in mind is the product is very oily, so if you already have oily skin you may not enjoy this serum. Otherwise I absolutely recommend it!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Blemish-Prone Skin and Uneven Texture",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product really surprised me. Its exfoliating power is amazing. For almost a year I had a grain of millet on my eyelid. Even though I exfoliated a lot it didn't go away so I had given up. I bought this product after using salicylic serums from various brands (I have a tendency to pimples and blackheads) and after only 5 applications the millet grain is gone. I am very happy. The only flaw is that it's oily, which I don't like. I'll buy it back for sure."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Argireline Solution 10%, Serum Good for Reducing the Appearance of Fine Lines, 1 Fl Oz",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Argireline has been touted as having a Botox-like effect on muscles under the skin. I happily use other products from the Ordinary and thought I’d give this a try. Their argireline solution is colorless, odorless, and extremely watery. It dries on the skin relatively quickly and leaves no residue. The effect? It makes no difference whatsoever. Except that the package was sealed, if someone had swapped the contents with water, I would not have known the difference. This is a huge disappointment and a waste of money from what I would otherwise consider to be a good brand. I don’t understand where the good reviews are coming from."

Super thin, watery consistency. You wouldn’t even notice you had put it on. Unfortunately this is also true given the lack of any effects. No noticeable effect after a month or so of use. It’s inexpensive but nonetheless a waste of money."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Argireline Solution 10%, Serum Good for Reducing the Appearance of Fine Lines, 1 Fl Oz",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It seems, over a month and using 2x a day to be lessening my forehead lines and they’re not as prominent. For me, though, the product seems to be causing headaches. Bad headaches. Maybe it’s my forehead’s inability to morph into a Transformers-type forehead with muscle superpowers that gives me horrible tension headaches. I found a thread online of people with similar issues. Maybe. So it’s not worth it to me to feel like this for days. I’ll stay wrinkly."

I have small red bumps on my skin in the areas where I used this now, and hoping I can get them to go away before I go on a vacation next week.

I gave two stars because I liked the ""feel"" of my skin when using this under moisturizer day & night--and it had no scent--but there's simply no reason to ever purchase these again. There was no visible difference *whatsoever* in wrinkles or fine lines."

After reading about Argireline Serum in a health magazine and reading all the rave reviews I decided to give it a try. It is supposed to target the appearance of dramatic lines. What a surprise when I opened the bottle and discovered the serum was nothing more than a watery, runny liquid. I used it sometimes twice a day for a month and no great transformation--no plumping, no smoothing, no improvement. At this point I am not kidding myself or anyone else for that matter that anything will happen. What a disappointment, especially after all the P.R. about the stuff!

My only complaint is that in using this I've noticed more congestion in my forehead and between my brows. No massive pimples or anything just a few clogged pores and nothing bad enough to stop using this solution. I'd recommend to anyone not wanting botox but desiring a similar more subtle effect."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Argireline Solution 10%, Serum Good for Reducing the Appearance of Fine Lines, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Ordinary as a company is a company that does things simply, transparently, and most importantly, how is your health at the forefront. Today, I will be reviewing one of their products, the argireline solution 10%. Someone who has been worrying more more about wrinkles over the years, and wanting to find a slightly quicker fix as opposed to jumping into Botox, I wanted to see what other products I could use on my face to try and gently prevent my face from aging just a little bit, I’m about 30 years old, and while I do look younger than my actual age, time will eventually catch up to me, and I just want to make sure that I am taking as best care of my looks while I still have them somewhat.

For those of you, who don’t know about the solution, the solution is supposed to target the appearances of dynamic facial lines. It’s recommended to apply a few drops on the forehead and around the eyes twice daily before applying heavier treatments. There is a possibility for some people, that your skin could get irritation. I can confirm in my case I did not receive any irritation after patch testing, and actually I felt my skin tightening whenever I’ve been using this product. The effects are not aggressive, and actually it felt quite light on my skin. Almost feels watery like in texture, which is a bit different to the hyralauric acid and the niacinamide. Makes a nice change, as some of the products I tend to put on my face seems to give off a sticky icky feeling.

The bottle is simple in design, which I appreciate as I am quite minimalistic as an individual and often feel guilty about throwing away product bottles that have a fancier design. It’s durable, and recyclable, so for those of you who are all about the eco-friendly culture, this is the bottle to get really. It’s very sturdy, and I’ve not had problems with leakages. The pippet used to grab some of the solution is not too tough to pinch, which I appreciate as my strength is not the best.

The ordinary provides high-quality products for a more affordable price, and I’m happy to say that this is worth the purchase for a wide variety of reasons. The solution its self is quality. The packaging too is also quality."

I use it alone, then I add Matrixyl serum to this serum for a nice finish before my sunscreen/moisturizer. It's not overnight but well worth the low price if used religiously.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Argireline Solution 10%, Serum Good for Reducing the Appearance of Fine Lines, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So this is my elixir . It takes about 6 weeks to see the results using twice daily . But once you see it , it hits you big time (I stopped using it for 3 months and I deeply regret it as I'm hideous looking now, it's all fell back down) , it creeps up so you won't see the changes till a few weeks . So it's water based , feels like water and has no scent , this is normal as I know some worry about this , but after application it will turn a tad tacky once it's onto the 3rd drying stage . I use this is on face , neck and decollete , and the back of my hands . Be careful around the eyes , it tightened me up to the point I was starting to look foxy eyed , so I lessened the amount at that section , it also might have been my sweeping motions while applying, who knows . This will last about 6 months for me ,you might differ . But you're gonny love it . And it's cheap as bloody hell . Just watch the temples and eyes , use less on those sections, unless the foxy look is the intended result ."

This last purchase that I ordered and just opened seems to be something is defiantly wrong!!! This bottle was clear as water and it felt like water when I used it. I put some in the palm of my hand and added another type of oil I had and they would not mix together. I am pretty sure I received a bottle of water. Oil and water do not mix and thats what I got."

It had a mild scent, and while it could be on the greasier side, it helped so much with long lasting moisture retention and healing injuries from picking/barrier damage. However, most recently the product I’ve received has been clear and very thin, almost akin to the amino acids formula. It doesn’t offer the same healing power and application as the original formula, and is easily outshined by squalane.

I have dry leaning and sensitive skin. The oil was very nice on the skin though. Smelled pretty good to me, though I know some people hate the smell, and it’s great for dryness and redness. However, after a little while, the squeeze part of the applicator started getting discolored and really soft. It was like it was decaying. I didn’t have this oil for more than a year, but I had to throw it out once the applicator tip started getting gross like that. Oil itself is great though."

My skin drinks it up with no super greasy feel in the morning. I have very sensitive combination skin with occasional hormonal breakouts. This stuff doesn’t seem to make me break out more, in fact it seems to calm a lot of the redness.

Giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because the dropper is kind of leaky, but the product itself is gold!"

The product takes about 30min to soak in. The only downside is the smell. I researched how rosehip oil is suppose to look and smell and this product is like what it is suppose to be. The smell does fade as the oil penetrates the skin.

The product did not make my skin breakout but rather purge I realized months later when I came across similar reviews so I picked up the oil and started using it again, it did make me purge the first week but after that my skin became better than most days, I had my ups and downs (mostly die to my diet) but this product has kept my skin from breaking out for a while and I have noticed it has controlled oil production and also lightened my dark spots a bit but they still are noticeable so if your buying this product dependant only for your dark spots then it might be a hit or miss."

I can not give it 5 stars because I haven’t used it on a regular basis to get top effects, that’s all. I usually use it during my night time routine because it is too oily to wear during the day (unless you have dry skin). It did not irritate me or cause breakouts and that’s why I love it.

First of all, I have to say that I often splurge for very expensive face products like La Mer and Obagi. I used to be a firm believer that it must be expensive for it to work. But this face oil has changed my outlook. It does the job my face stays hydrated, my make up goes on smoother, and the price is perfect. I will say that it does have a mild smell that would resemble some like a vegetable oil, but I use it under my moisturizer, which smells delicious, so it doesn’t really bother me. If you’re on the fence, I would buy it and see if you like it, because, after giving a chance, it’s part of my daily routine."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil, Addresses Signs of Aging by Improving the Appearance of Uneven Skin Tone, Supporting Skin Elasticity, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have dark acne scars (but not deep scars), and my friend recommended this to me. I've had this product for maybe 3 or 4 weeks. The reason I purchased this was specifically to reduce appearance of scaring. I have extremely oily skin, that is also extremely dry at the exact same time (flaky). Mosturizures don't work for me. I've tried tons of them. I also have relatively large pores around my nose. This oil has helped in so many ways that I didn't even know it would. My skin FINALLY has a great balance of oily and dry, my frowning wrinkles are significantly less noticable (I'm only 26 and had deep forehead wrinkles). And pores have gotten smaller! This oil DID NOT help as much as I wanted it to with scarring, but it has made a tiny difference! So I will keep using it because maybe after a year all of my scarring will be completely gone. As far as breakouts, I get random giant breakouts at least twice a month. I basically always have at least one giant pimple at all times. This oil has not impacted the amount or severity of my breakouts, but it has not helped my breakouts either. Overall, really loving this product so far."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil, Addresses Signs of Aging by Improving the Appearance of Uneven Skin Tone, Supporting Skin Elasticity, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have not been able to wear makeup for years due to how oily my face has been. Half way through my day my eyes would be burning. Even without makeup I would have to wash my face at least twice during the work day. I saw a You Tube video where she used this product on her oily face. Seems counter productive BUT dry skin over compensates and over produces oil throughout the day. I have been using this product for 5 days at night. I use three drops and pat this onto my clean face at bedtime. I have worn a full face of makeup everyday and today is day 5. On day 5 I have not had any need to wash my face during the day, no eye burning and here I set at the end of the day with a full face of makeup. I have had no breakouts. I am in love with this product."

The convenience of the rose hip oil with a dropper is awesome. Its small enough to go on a carry-on flight (I travel a lot for work) and sturdy enough glass bottle that I'm not afraid of it exploding. I have some chronically dry skin, so this oil is great. You really only need a few tiny drops to cover the entire face. Rub it in and let it soak up while you brush your teeth or something. Then its easy to apply primer and makeup or sunscreen or bareface. It doesn't seem to make the skin shiny or oily after the initial few minutes of absorption. I love it and the little bottle lasts a really long time when used appropriately, so that's a bonus too."

I have been using this for 3-4 months now (good for me because I usually have to change what I'm using by now) and really like how this moisturizes my skin without clogging my pores. There is a light earthy scent that is not bad at all. I use this after I wash and spray toner with a barrier balm at night because my skin is so dry and we live in the north with the heat running nonstop. I use this in the morning under my makeup without the barrier balm and my foundation/tinted moisturizer smooths on nicely. The price is great and it lasts because you don't need much, maybe a couple drops per application. I have had absolutely no reaction to this product and would highly recommend."

I read up on it a good bit for purchasing and knew it was important to look for rose hip oil that is 100% organic and cold-pressed so i knew this was perfect to use. It’s not fragrances so some people don’t like the smell but just using a pea sized amount on my face was all I needed and I never noticed the smell once it was on. After, using this product a while and not seeing results in my skin my dermatologist advice me to discontinue use due to it being to heavy and clogging my pores. I recommend asking a dermatologist before using."

If it's clear or has no scent, it has been over processed. My order is a golden yellow with the earthy scent. Perfect. It is supposed to be used at night because it is heavier, but my skin has never been clearer or more beautiful. I use it after I use the peel, and use the buffet every morning and the rest of the evenings. Totally not paid for my review, I'm just so excited to find an affordable skin care line that actually works"

I use a few of their other products and when I wanted to try out a oil in place of moisturizer, I went to them.

However, the very first product arrived today but instead of 100ml as stated on this page, the product is actually 30 ml while interestingly, the label sticked on the packaging says 100 ml. I am pretty confused and I hope the customer service can contact me to solve the problem."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA, Lightweight Hydrator for Skin Barrier Support & Hydration",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not sure which one of them is the culprit or maybe all. I started using the ordinary product three weeks ago, i ordered moisturizer, hyaluronic acid and the glycolic toner. Ive started to notice after 2 days of use that my face gets dark even though i used it as per instructed only and soooo oily. Then i got pimples which are huge and painful and followed by the blackheads and noticeable pigmentation. I tried only the ordinary line because
I was hearing good things about but its really not for my akin type."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA, Lightweight Hydrator for Skin Barrier Support & Hydration",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"A seller who sends you a product in this condition is shameful to say the least! It comes to me with the damaged box without a seal... In addition, the cream was so hot that it makes me doubtful about the quality in general... First of all, quality is demonstrated in how it presents a product and how to make it arrive in excellent condition... this is my advice to the seller. I made the return. I obviously don't recommend it to anyone."

It has a paste-like consistency until you take time to warm it up in hands. On the positive it doesn't hurt my skin like a lot of commerical face creams do, and does moisturise ok once it blends. It's simply a shame that it doesn't blend in well. I probably won't buy it again."

At the end of the day all skin is different and what works for some wont work for others. I am a fair skinned red head with sensitive skin, prone to dryness in winter - and I can say for myself this product I started out too harsh. However over time it has become really gentle.. not sure why or how. But my skin feels nice and soft. When I first got product I asked my mum to try it who is dark skinned and oily complexion and she also felt like it ""burned"" when she applied it. So this is based on two opinions and skin types; it started out as a harsh product but once skin adapted it works very nicely… . Probably wouldn’t buy again though"

I bought this because all of the other products that I have from this company are amazing, so I thought I’d give this a try. After purchasing, but prior to it arriving, I was told that it’s probably the only bad product this company had ever made, so I was a little disappointed, but I have been using it for 3 weeks now & I love it!! So maybe it just didn’t work for their skin type, I am a bit on the dryer side if that helps, but I think this is a wonderful moisturizer, it’s not thick or heavy feeling, but at the same time it makes my skin feel like it’s been soaked in water or something along those lines because of how hydrated & soft it leaves my skin feeling. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone!!"

I haven't had breakouts with it or any irritation, works well with my other skin products and mixes well with my face sunscreen. A little iffy with buying off of Amazon, but it says it came from the ordinary store. Doesn't really have much of a smell, just a scent less lotion."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA, Lightweight Hydrator for Skin Barrier Support & Hydration",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I enjoy this product for its lightweight moister, I have very oily skin so I’m always very careful as to what moisturizers I buy.

At first use it stung my skin a bit, but after about three more applications it felt great on my skin!"

It does have certyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol in it however these are good for soothing and healing dry skin.
I also really like the ingredient list, the hyaluronic acid help keeps the skin moisturised and the glycerin helps to attract water to the skin.
I really appreciate that it is vegan and oil free.
As I have dry skin that is easily irritated I also lime the fact that it is fragrance free."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Multi-Peptide + Copper Peptides 1%, Anti-Aging Serum for Fine Lines and Skin Elasticity",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite its name, this serum is no ordinary serum. It does wonders for my skin. I have heard many wonderful things about copper peptides and this serum is just as described. I use it as an anti-aging serum to reduce wrinkles. The copper peptide is supposed to help increase skin elasticity and even out skin tone. It also helps with skin hydration and to improve skin thickness. After applying the serum, there is no tacky feeling. The serum readily absorbs into my skin and does not irritate the skin. The serum is quite thin but it definitely packs a punch in hydration. After applying it for a few weeks, my skin texture feels smooth and even. The skin is well hydrated and nourished. I really like this serum!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Multi-Peptide + Copper Peptides 1%, Anti-Aging Serum for Fine Lines and Skin Elasticity",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been a big fan of The Ordinary for a long time, but this is my first time trying their copper peptide serum, which is known for its anti-aging properties.

First off, don’t be put off by the blue color of the serum—it’s not visible once applied to the skin. Like all products from this brand, it’s been gentle on my sensitive, mature skin, with no adverse reactions.

The serum is incredibly moisturizing, to the point where there are days I don’t feel the need to follow up with an additional moisturizer. After just a few days of daily use, my skin feels noticeably softer and well-nourished.

One of the standout features is that the serum is completely fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for me.

While the price might seem a bit high for the amount you’re getting, you’re paying for a high-quality, effective product that lasts a long time—since you only need to use a few drops each time. Overall, I think it’s a great investment for healthy, hydrated skin."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Multi-Peptide + Copper Peptides 1%, Anti-Aging Serum for Fine Lines and Skin Elasticity",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am just learning about peptides. To avoid an adverse reaction, I've been using once daily. In about two weeks, there's an improvement in my skin's texture. Application is quick and easy with the dropper, and it leaves a ""tacky"" feeling to the skin. I follow with moisturizer. The product is safe and effective, and as the clock seems to spin faster as we age, it's a good way to stem the tide. I recommend!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Multi-Peptide + Copper Peptides 1%, Anti-Aging Serum for Fine Lines and Skin Elasticity",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use The Ordinary’s main HLA/squalene product for so many skin uses and love it… so tried this one based upon my love of the brand.

Can’t speak, yet, to efficacy, but it’s a similar thin, watery (in a good way) serum/liquid.

Makeup still smooths over it well and sure will be a nice addition to my results w my skincare routine!

Will update if any unexpected issues but doubt there will be. This is a great brand at an extremely reasonable price point!"

It’s incredibly grainy and remains so, to the point if the grains are C, it would be impossible to absorb.
This also makes any oils or moisture put on after “roll” and sit in the skin.
My biggest complaint however is the no return policy along with no way to contact the shipper to see if this is faulty product or request return and refund. Bad product, sketchy vendor."

This is quite thin with exfoliant beads so i cant really leave it on if I want to apply make-up. Its unclear whether you wash it off or wipe it off. I assume wipe so that's what I did. Also, it is 23% 'proof' and although the extra 3% doesn't sound like much, I have found it is strong enough to burn a little when I put on and uncomfortable. I may have to return it.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2%, Serum with Pure L-Ascorbic Acid",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm struggling on whether to give this 4 or 5 stars because this TRULY works well for dark spot correction. I had a giant breakout of eczema on my legs and used this is conjunction with Alpha Arbutin to make the resulting dark spots fade away. I went from looking like the entirety of my front shins were bruised to faint markings now (that would probably be gone if I consistently treated them again, but I'm lazy). The consistency is quite rough though and I hated that part. There's a new formulation with silicone that melds better. If using this formulation, mix with another product like Hyluronic Acid (I know that's what the HA spheres in this one are, but I'm pretty sure that's what gave it the awful gritty texture; use a serum instead) or another water-based serum with it for smoother application."

After reading some other comments I did some research and according to the manufacturer the grainy texture is due to vitamin c powder being suspended in some oil base. There is no water in this product. The manufacturer recommends using it with some other cream. I have only been using it a couple days but I can feel a difference in my skin. It does itch and I can feel a tingling the next morning after applying. But beauty is pain."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2%, Serum with Pure L-Ascorbic Acid",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first tried this Vitamin C product, I did not care for it at all. I've had great experiences with all of my other Ordinary products and know all skin is different so figured maybe it was user error or just not for my skin. I tried using it several times in several different ways - by itself without any other facial products, directly after cleansing, after each serum I use, and also at the very end of my routine. I tried 6 or 7 different times with no luck. No matter the experiment, the result was the same; peely on the skin, waxy/greasy feeling, weird gritty texture.. Despite my best efforts, I was just not a fan. I retired it and continued with my routine. A few weeks later, I had an idea to use the same damp facial sponge I use for my serums to apply the vitamin C, instead of my fingers like I had been doing previously... once I used it with a facial sponge, I found a new love for this product! Not sure if the sponge just picks up all the stuff that peels off or what, but it's a game changer, for sure! Now, I use the vitamin C suspension after all my other serums but before my oils and moisturizer. It works great and my skin looks flawless. The retinol serum is wonderful also. I haven't found a product that doesn't work for my sensitive skin, so far, some just take a little more ""figuring out"" than others.

I'd strongly recommend picking up some facial sponges (amazon has them pretty cheap) and trying this VC Suspension in combination with the retinol and cold pressed rose hip oil, if your skin can handle it. It makes my skin feel and look so dreamy."

I've been suffering a MAJOR skin barrier issue that resulted in a ton of flaking and acne and in general my face had every issue possible happening. I've had the same routine for several years but something changed I guess. Tonight I washed and toned as usual, then used this serum and sealed it with rose hip oil on my dry patches (because my normal moisturizer hurts my acne spots rn I'm usually bone dry). This product on first use feels very nice. The past few nights of just using rose hip oil on my dry patches left me feeling really tight and this kind of closed the gap.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulsion, High-Strength Retinoid Serum for Advanced Anti-Aging Support, 0.5 Fl Oz",,4.0 out of 5 stars,I really enjoyed this product because it was strong enough that I could see that it was making a difference in some of the textured areas where I had problems if you did put too much on though it can be very drying. I’m quite fond of it and probably will keep using it because it does work on the fine lines.

Antes usaba retinol que me resultaba más irritante. Tiene una buena concentración de retinal para lo que hay en el mercado y el precio es muy competitivo. The Ordinary no suele fallar.

Lo recomiendo sin duda."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulsion, High-Strength Retinoid Serum for Advanced Anti-Aging Support, 0.5 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using the product for a few months. I have been a retinAL user for approximately 6 months. I have found that it is helpful for skin texture and fine lines. But I noticed my 0.1 retinAL (not regular retinol-which is much less potent) wasn’t giving me the desired effects anymore. So I bumped up to this 0.2 strength. I only use it every other or second day, and it works very well. It doesn’t appear greasy on my skin, and the thickness is not over dense, so it is easy to spread a small drop over a large area. RetinAL is short for retinaldehyde, which is one step away from being converted to regular prescription strength retin-A. I am getting prescription like results without the scorched face side effect as I did from Retin-A in the 1980’s."

At this point I am not kidding myself or anyone else for that matter that anything will happen. What a disappointment, especially after all the P.R. about the stuff!

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Argireline Solution 10%, Serum Good for Reducing the Appearance of Fine Lines, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love that the consistency is not as viscous as other ordinary products. They tend to gum up on me under my tinted sunscreen or foundation, but this one is thin and absorbs quickly. I CAN still move my forehead etc however, my 11's do look significantly reduced with twice daily use. It could be placebo effect, but either way I definitely see improvement! My only complaint is that in using this I've noticed more congestion in my forehead and between my brows. No massive pimples or anything just a few clogged pores and nothing bad enough to stop using this solution. I'd recommend to anyone not wanting botox but desiring a similar more subtle effect."

So much so, I am buying more since it's almost gone!!

I have sensitive skin & it doesn't cake up in my pores & you can tell it's actually absorbing! Within about 2 weeks, I've noticed a HUGE reduction in the appearance of the lines around my lips, eyes & between my eyebrows! I am one happy customer!!"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Argireline Solution 10%, Serum Good for Reducing the Appearance of Fine Lines, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Ordinary as a company is a company that does things simply, transparently, and most importantly, how is your health at the forefront. Today, I will be reviewing one of their products, the argireline solution 10%. Someone who has been worrying more more about wrinkles over the years, and wanting to find a slightly quicker fix as opposed to jumping into Botox, I wanted to see what other products I could use on my face to try and gently prevent my face from aging just a little bit, I’m about 30 years old, and while I do look younger than my actual age, time will eventually catch up to me, and I just want to make sure that I am taking as best care of my looks while I still have them somewhat.

For those of you, who don’t know about the solution, the solution is supposed to target the appearances of dynamic facial lines. It’s recommended to apply a few drops on the forehead and around the eyes twice daily before applying heavier treatments. There is a possibility for some people, that your skin could get irritation. I can confirm in my case I did not receive any irritation after patch testing, and actually I felt my skin tightening whenever I’ve been using this product. The effects are not aggressive, and actually it felt quite light on my skin. Almost feels watery like in texture, which is a bit different to the hyralauric acid and the niacinamide. Makes a nice change, as some of the products I tend to put on my face seems to give off a sticky icky feeling.

The bottle is simple in design, which I appreciate as I am quite minimalistic as an individual and often feel guilty about throwing away product bottles that have a fancier design. It’s durable, and recyclable, so for those of you who are all about the eco-friendly culture, this is the bottle to get really. It’s very sturdy, and I’ve not had problems with leakages. The pippet used to grab some of the solution is not too tough to pinch, which I appreciate as my strength is not the best.

The ordinary provides high-quality products for a more affordable price, and I’m happy to say that this is worth the purchase for a wide variety of reasons. The solution its self is quality. The packaging too is also quality."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Argireline Solution 10%, Serum Good for Reducing the Appearance of Fine Lines, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So this is my elixir . It takes about 6 weeks to see the results using twice daily . But once you see it , it hits you big time (I stopped using it for 3 months and I deeply regret it as I'm hideous looking now, it's all fell back down) , it creeps up so you won't see the changes till a few weeks . So it's water based , feels like water and has no scent , this is normal as I know some worry about this , but after application it will turn a tad tacky once it's onto the 3rd drying stage . I use this is on face , neck and decollete , and the back of my hands . Be careful around the eyes , it tightened me up to the point I was starting to look foxy eyed , so I lessened the amount at that section , it also might have been my sweeping motions while applying, who knows . This will last about 6 months for me ,you might differ . But you're gonny love it . And it's cheap as bloody hell . Just watch the temples and eyes , use less on those sections, unless the foxy look is the intended result ."

Compared to my first bottle (from the Ordinary's website) this oil absorbs into the skin immediately. Anyone that's used oil on their skin knows that it tends to sit on the surface for a while as it absorbs. The authentic Squalane did wonders for my skin and made my matte foundation sit beautifully. With this, my skin didn't look like it had been moisturized at all and had dry patches. I ordered from Amazon vs the Ordinary site directly because the Ordinary was running 10 days behind on fulfilling orders and I would run out before then. I will not make that mistake again."

Squalane people who are using everyday have no stimulation at all, I tried using hemi-squalane that arrived reluctantly last night, but there is no moisturizing feeling of oil at all, Conversely, I was pimpirii for about an hour.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane, for Skin and Hair, Lightweight Hydration, and Moisture Barrier Support, 1 Fl Oz",,2.0 out of 5 stars,My face was extra shiny just for applying 1 drop. I have combination skin and bought this at the worst time (summer). It’s possibly not suitable for Indian weather (hot and humid) and oily skin. This doesn’t last long (6 months PAO).

This time though after application the product has an after smell. I’ve never experienced any scent before use or smell after application of the product. I’m not sure if the product is a bad batch or old but it’s unfortunate because going from never have a smell to having one is concerning and makes me question the quality.

Regardless, I was using the Timeless brand oil and I thought I'd try this to save money. I use it as a makeup remover and this just isn't as effective as the Timeless version.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane, for Skin and Hair, Lightweight Hydration, and Moisture Barrier Support, 1 Fl Oz",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent. For the first time in my life I am moisturizing consistently without breakouts. For the first week, I used three drops because I scoffed at the idea that I could moisturize my whole face with two drops of oil. I think my skin was a little dehydrated so three drops was great until it wasn't, and I've since cut back to two drops. TWO DROPS. Great stuff, this is the best my skin has looked in years. Wouldn't buy it here, unless you're desperate. You can get it through Deciem's website for like seven bucks a bottle. They were out of stock when I ordered, so I will plan ahead when I need more.
update: I unfortunately had to stop using this product because it broke me out. Really bummed, because my skin looked great initially after using it. If you can tolerate oils, I highly recommend, though!"

So, a few days ago, because the lid was not secured as should have been, the bottle tipped over and I lost half of the bottle of product on the floor. next time I receive a bottle of any product where the lid is defective I will be sending it back.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane, for Skin and Hair, Lightweight Hydration, and Moisture Barrier Support, 1 Fl Oz",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Had big expectations for this product, having read glowing online reviews here and elsewhere. I have used Squalane for a week and unfortunately discovered that it has been the cause of new breakouts of my face. Further research led me to the discovery that certain types of skin are simply more sensitive to the ingredient. I would recommend patch testing with this.

I applied it at night, and I can vouch for its moisturizing power, as my skin was fairly hydrated the following morning. However, I personally did not like the consistency of this. It does not absorb completely, rather it has a tendency to sit on the skin, as noted by other reviewers. I have repurposed it for lip hydration but will altogether avoid application on the rest of my face. All in all, I would not repurchase."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane, for Skin and Hair, Lightweight Hydration, and Moisture Barrier Support, 1 Fl Oz",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"After some uses the lid would refuse to screw on properly which was annoying

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane, for Skin and Hair, Lightweight Hydration, and Moisture Barrier Support, 1 Fl Oz",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been wanting to try 100% squalane, and was happy to find The Ordinary's offering on Amazon. It would cost less to order from The Ordinary, but Amazon (prime) is move convenient and I feel sure I got it faster. The Ordinary is no longer carried by Sephora, so that makes it especially nice to see it on Amazon.

The Ordinary, even at Amazon Prime's price, is a way better value than some of other brands out there. One advantage of some of the more expensive brands, though, is that they disclose the source of the squalane, which is usually sugar cane or olives. I guess it shouldn't matter (as long as it's not from shark livers, whole other story there), but I would like to know.

Ok, about how the product performs: I wanted to add an oil to my skincare routine, to see if it would help with issues of aging. Normally, I use light gel-cream moisturizers and was thinking that, while I'm getting enough hydration, I may not be getting enough moisture. And squalane has a reputation for being a non-greasy oil, and it is often recommended for aging skin, as our skin supposedly make less and less of it as we age. So I tried it, pressing it into clean skin. It feels really nice, but is still a little too oily/heavy for me (it does seem to continue to absorb during the day, but not as much as I'd like). I am now experimenting with blending a little of it into some different serums and moisturizers.

Here is another way I am using the squlane oil, which is as a ""carrier oil"" : I have seborrhea (yuck!) in my eyebrows and am trying tea tree oil for that. But alone, tea tree oil is too strong and really needs to be mixed with a carrier oil. I had been using olive oil, which is very greasy. Now I'm mixing a about ten drops squalane with ten of tee tree oil (still pretty strong, you may wish to dilute the tea tree oil more than that). I like this!"

I have really dry skin and have been having a hard time wearing foundation because of my dry skin. I was told to try an oil. Went to Sephora and they gave me a facial and one product was Squalane oil. I LOVED it. Problem was the bottle was $60. Did some research online and found that this was a good dupe. Love the product. Soaks in my skin well, doesn't smell bad, and doesn't leave it uncomfortably greasy. Also for the price it's worth a good try!"

It does look a bit greasy so I tend to only use it at night when my skin is feeling really dry or looks irritated. I tend to use a little on top of moisturiser to help seal it in rather than just on it's own but would say it's really helped. Definitely has saved my skin from harsh effects of cold weather and central heating over the winter season. Would highly recommend if you have dry sensitive skin. A little bit more expensive than buying in store is my only complaint but other than that excellent product!

One thing I noticed about my skin is that since I started to use it not only is it baby butt soft but it has helped ease the redness in my face. In my first pic although I have makeup there is a lot of redness on my cheeks from leftover acne marks to inflammation (allergies) but taken today the second picture shows my skin with a more even texture/color.

I bought this to help moisturize my skin because I always slumped out on face lotion or sunscreen due to it feeling greasy on my face. The oil when applied to my greasy kitchen face feels a liiiiiittle bit heavy but it soaks in after you give it some time. I read online you are supposed to add 2-3 drops on your face. Well I have a fat face because that wasn’t enough so I take 4-5 drops in my hands and rub it in my face. The instructions also say to pat it on so it goes deep in your pores but I gently rubbed my face. I know rubbing your face causes wrinkles but rubbing it in for a good 30 secs really helped the oil soak into my skin. I use a mat tidying moisturizer after this and it helps my oily face soak up all the good stuff within ten mins. (Moisturizer is Origins Matte Moisturizer with Willowherb). It could be my combo of the oil and the lotion that makes my face absorb it all but I highly recommend both because I did not react at all to either.

Now usually my eczema reacts nasty to some skincare products but not this oil. The oil does not smell either. Before this I tried the Radha rosehip oil and that smells like moldy crayons but I cannot smell anything with this!

TIP: buy from the actual Deciem site or Sephora because it’s cheaper than Amazon. I paid 14$ for this because I desperately needed something to Moisturize my face and I have no regrets paying the extra money.

I do wish this company would come out with a 2-4 oz size of this bottle because I would definitely hand them more of my money. This product will make your skin softer and did not cause me to breakout (allergies or pimples). If you have oily skin I would really recommend a matte lotion on top of it or mixing some drops with your lotion in your hand or a cup then applying it. I have no patience and I do the oil first wait a minute for my face to take some of it in then apply my eye cream/lotion on top of that.

Good luck!"

The product was well packaged and I had no problems with the integrity of the product. This oil is amazing. I have tanned, dry, sensitive acne prone skin and this product does well to give me that surface hydration without being oily nor disturbing the makeup I layer on top. I’ve replaced this oil multiple times with other products and I always go back to this product. It takes a month of consistent use to see the effects :)"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane, for Skin and Hair, Lightweight Hydration, and Moisture Barrier Support, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did not realize all of the great benefits of this oil, whatsoever, before I bought it. Mostly, I was looking for a reliable lip moisturizer that did not have anything extra in it like most products do. This also had strong recommendations for adding it to your skin care regimen as a facial oil so I thought those sound like pretty good reasons to try this stuff.... Well....I do have to admit I have also been using it on my God-awful sunburn I acquired several days ago. I should be peeling by now. I do not think that will be happening, and squalane oil was a major factor.

So not only does it keep your lips properly hydrated and helps restore the sebum of your skin and produces a lovely ""facial glow""...it is very absorbent and will not clog your pores AT ALL. A very light but hardworking oil. You can also use it on your hair, which I have yet to try but I have no doubts thus far."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane, for Skin and Hair, Lightweight Hydration, and Moisture Barrier Support, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE ORDINARY'S SQUALANE OIL. I had ordered the trial sizes of the Biossance oil and I LOVED it, but it doesn't last very long considering I actually use the squalane oil for my hair and not my skin. The Biossance oil is fifty or sixty dollars and as a college student there is absolutely no way I can afford that without either saving up or living off of ramen for a month....or six. Biossance derives their squalane from cane sugar plants I believe, so I wanted to find a squalane oil brand that did the same, which was FAR harder than you would believe, since most companies get their squalane from olives (which kind of just seems like...milder olive oil to me). Well the ordinary doesn't have where their oil is derived from BUT they DO have a system for emailing them questions, so I asked, and lo and behold, they derive their squalane from cane sugar as well, so i figured it was a safe (and cheap) bet to order this in place of the Biossance oil. I have VERY curly, dry, split end prone hair and this oil helps keep it not only moisturized, but also helps keep my curls defined and looking nice instead of insanely unruly and frizzy for a fraction of the price that the Biossance oil does, and the point of this very long winded explanation is this; It is JUST as good (perhaps even better when factoring cost) as the Biossance 100% Squalane and I will forever buy this instead."

I've been using this oil at night 4-5 nights per week on top of another Vitamin C based serum on my face, neck, and chest for a couple of weeks (I use a retinal based product on the other nights). I generally have very dry, easily irritated skin, but I still normally have a couple of pimples before/during my period, especially if I'm also stressed - except for recently. I had my first break-out free cycle literally ever using this product. It feels a bit oily going on, then slightly sticky, but then it sinks in completely. Plus, it's unscented (as opposed to fragrance-free). One dropper is more than enough for my entire face, neck, and chest, with enough left to rub into my hands (which are also much more comfortable), although I have noticed that, after a couple of weeks, I seem to be needing to use less and less. I'm a big fan."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane, for Skin and Hair, Lightweight Hydration, and Moisture Barrier Support, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Light serum in a dark bottle. Cold pressed and not animal derived, it can be marine derived, or olive oil, according to the company. I was a cosmetic formulator by trade and The Ordinary seems to be incredibly minimal, but dead on as to particular skin conditions. I have mature skin and acne, yuck. I am fifty three and no acne would be nice. I've tried other oils, but honestly they made me look dewy and drippy. Squalane is not like that. It's a little runny, be careful when you drop some, you don't need to squeeze the end, it will run into your hand, apply with clean fingers and allow to stay, or rinse with warm water, gently, then tone, non-alcohol, no drying, and sunscreen, or your nighttime routine. I love how this sinks into my skin, is not greasy and seems to be all in there before I rinse and use toner. I love it."

I add a few drops to some moisturizer on my palm and rub into my face then use a jade roller to massage in. It soaks up easily and spreads well. It feels so good and leaves you with a sweet glow in the morning or night! Highly recommend. No smell or color - just simple!
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane, for Skin and Hair, Lightweight Hydration, and Moisture Barrier Support, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I revamped my skin care routine in March and bought this squalane to supplement my moisturizer. It’s very lightweight and absorbs quickly, and I haven’t had any issues with clogged pores or lingering oiliness. It does not play well with the Ordinary’s Hyaluronic Acid (2% + B5) or Niacinamide (10% + Zinc 1%) - layering them on top of one another - as directed by The Ordinary - often causes crazy pilling. I don’t think my skin is a huge fan of the Hyaluronic Acid or the Niacinamide anyways so I’ve eliminated them from my routine and haven’t had any issues with pilling since."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%, Formula for Uneven and Blemish-Prone Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Working so far
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%, Formula for Uneven and Blemish-Prone Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Before getting azelaic acid RX I wanted to test because my skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and reactive to just about everything nowadays. This is pretty great. Definitely soothing my skin more than just about anything else in recent years. I generally avoid silicones in skin care but harder in makeup, but this is not bothering me. Can't speak to long term exfoliating or pigment or clearing acne uses but as extended ""patch test"" I was pleasantly surprised. Silicone feel of a primer 'finish,' matte look but clear, no tint. I don't use primer much at my age but would likely work instead. More of an SPF tinted moisturizer/BB or green CC type now. Reminds me of Dr Brandt pores no more texture but more luscious (these days I'm more Dr Jart/Shisedo BB). Doesn't dry my tight, sensitive skin but no oil to absorb here. Compared to adalpene, gly/sal, lactic acid, etc. very comfortable, no problems after a week of use am/pm. I would definitely recommend trying for rosacea, acne, sensitivity, dullness, aging. By far my favorite product from TO. Paula's choice AA booster has SA which sensitizes my skin like crazy. Glad I tested it out, first product that is a keeper in a while, my skin has been so intolerant."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%, Formula for Uneven and Blemish-Prone Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff really worked on my horrid rosacea. I had blotchy red skin on both sides of my cheeks and bumps on the bridge of my nose and even along the nostrils (!) that made me look like a clown from a sci-fi horror flick. Well, maybe not that bad, but it was ugly. I was desperate, but didn't want to do the antibiotic treatment. Using this cream 2x/day had almost immediate effects: less redness and blotchiness within a week. It took longer for the nose bumps to go away, but I've been using it for about 6 months now and they are GONE! It's important to use it twice a day--I've forgotten a couple of times and the bumps start coming back. The first tube I bought lasted 5 months or so--you don't need to use a lot, but you do need use it consistently. I am SO RELIEVED my skin is back to normal!!"

I’ve only been using this cream for a few days, once in the morning and once at night, and I can already see the difference. The redness isn’t totally gone but it’s WAY more subdued than it was. It also makes my current breakouts look less red, which I’m grateful for. A little of this cream goes a long way - you don’t get much in the tube, so use it sparingly and only on the parts of your face that are red. It also leaves your skin butter-soft, which is really nice. I hope the tube lasts me a while, but over all it’s worth the money. If your skin affects your confidence the way mine does, you’ll be grateful to have invested in this product."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%, Formula for Uneven and Blemish-Prone Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Azelaic acid is a decent option for acne and hyperpigmentation, which is why I buy this. This is a lower percentage than the prescription formulations (which I believe run 15% or higher) but they are also about 5x cheaper (if insurance does not cover the prescription version). Also, I've heard this is less irritating to skin than the higher percentages from others who have tried both. I hope The Ordinary keeps making this without jacking up the price.

P.S. I usually don't write reviews unless I'm procrastinating, have strong feelings one way or another about a product, or when I remember that I rely on good reviews from real people to make purchase decisions (I always check amazon profiles of informative reviews to be sure it's not a one off bot / paid review)."

She was diagnosed and prescribed 15% azelaic acid and an antibiotic cream. The azelaic acid was rejected so I bought her this 10% one. Her bulge started to shrink in less than 24 hours.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%, Formula for Uneven and Blemish-Prone Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am 26 and have had acne since I was 16, that turned into cystic hormonal acne in my 20's. I had deep cystic acne around the jaw and ears, along with mild redness and textured on the cheeks and nose. My mother has rosacea, and I have been under the assumption that I am probably developing it as well, but have never been formally diagnosed.

After trying a free one month curology trial that cured my acne with a 8% azelaic acid prescription cream, I decided to try this before renewing for another (25$) month of curology. After a 1 month on curology I had significant improvement in these areas but not full clearing. After one week on this cream, my acne was fully gone and redness is now only reappearing with hot weather or spicy food. I am using it currently with jan marini bioglycolic cleanser, which is excellent for gentle exfoliation, and a biossance moisturizer. I think the key to success with this product is using it at least once daily, twice if you can handle it without irritation, and a good moisturizer to prevent any dryness. This may not work for everyone, but you can't beat it for the price.

As a side note, I would buy this off Ulta or from deciem because it is cheaper and I'm unsure about the sellers on Amazon."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%, Formula for Uneven and Blemish-Prone Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently starting getting rosacea. Mine is not severe, relative to some photos I've seen, but nevertheless gets out of control if not treated, especially my nose.

Last year I paid $354 for Finacea and it worked, but $354!? At that point the 15% generic was not on the market, and I was unaware of any other options.

More recently, I rolled the dice on this $14, 10% azelaic acid from The Ordinary and it works too. Happy with the results and I don't have to ration it (I made that little tube of Finacea last 6+ months!).

So, I definitely recommend trying it. I am so relieved I found this."

The product line is made of clean ingredients and the best part is how affordable it all is. This foaming cleanser is no different. You get a big bottle for a great price. You only need a small amount of product to get a lot of foaming action. Didn’t leave my skin dry like some cleansers do. I use this as the second step in my skincare routine after the squeline cleanser.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've bought this item twice before and both times, its worked very well and is part of my regular daily skin care routine. However, this time when I bought it, it arrived an orange color...normally it is clear. I believe the reason for this is (this also applies to Vitamin C serum) that its because its old and has oxidized. In fact, the last bottle I had just long enough, before I used it up, that it started turning slightly orange because it had aged. When you use serum that has done this, its just not effective and doesn't work. So I'm returning and going to try buying from another seller. It looks like this is happening to a lot of people per the comments."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Received this, and it is a fairly moderate shade of orange.

Even my last bottle, which is almost empty, is not as dark of orange as this, even though it has oxidized a little bit over its use. This item is very damaged and hopefully the replacement will be better."

I have actually bought this product from ulta beauty and it looks and smells different than whatever I got. So awful do not trust do not buy!!!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve used the Ordinary’s lactic acid for about a year and love it.

I’m reluctant to use this so I feel like I got ripped off.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I put two drops of this into my skin lotion one night. That's it. I had no redness or stinging, and my skin is usually sensitive enough to tell me right away if something is too harsh for me, so I thought it was fine. Next day my skin looked totally normal. Until I went out into the sun ... literally 10 min on a cloudy day gave me the worst sunburn on my face and neck where I'd put this product. I completely stayed out of the sun for the next few weeks. But now it's three weeks later, once again I sat outside for lunch. Even though I was wearing a huge sun hat, within 5 minutes my face and neck erupted into burning redness, with a clear line on the side of face that shows where the product had been. Apparently my skin was so damaged by two drops of this product that I have now developed a sun allergy (polymorphic light eruption) where my skin breaks out into red, hot, inflamed, sunburn-like rash in the sun. I am beside myself, since I'm a gardener and hiker who loves to be outdoors. BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Like most other reviewers, I was looking to replace my Sunday habit. After about two weeks of use this product has not had much of an effect on my skin (whereas SR was immediate). Also what really concerns me is that the item arrived with packaging stickers that had an Asian language on it. I would normally have no problems with this if I was buying say, some K-beauty, but I'm pretty sure I've seen somewhere The Ordinary is made in the USA. This makes me wonder if its a knock off, and I'm seeing this a lot more on Amazon now which is so concerning. I don't think I'll be buying beauty products off Amazon anymore and stick with more reputable retailers. Off to Revolve for more Good Genes!"

I did a patch test with the bought P., the result was inconspicuous, it does not look for anything, but I did not want to apply it to my face. I'm particularly irritated by the color.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because so many people have said it's a dupe for Good Genes. It may very well do the same job as Good Genes, I can't tell just yet, but it's so, so sticky. My makeup doesn't go on very smooth when I've used it, and I know it says it's a night product, but I used my Good Genes in the morning, so that's when I use this. My face just stays sticky until I wash it. If you don't touch your face at all, maybe you won't notice, but I can't stop touching it, it's just so sticky. Going to look for another dupe. This one is the right price, but the texture distracts me from my day. Too bad."

I rated this 3 stars only because I believe the product itself is good (honestly I'm basing that off watching several you-tubers opinions) However, if you have sensitive skin, it may just be too much for you. Plus I also use a retinA from the dermatologist. (oh and i recommend adding it to your moisturizer to dilute the potency, that's what I do and it doesn't burn) Plus I also have some HA in my serum and moisturizer. So for me it was just too much for my skin. I don't think it's bad, its just not for me. And if I learned anything, skincare is very personalized."

It's hard to tell, but I think it does help soften my pores to be able to extract more. BUT afterwards my chin was destroyed both times! (see picture) My nose has some minor peeling, but my chin loses the entire outer layer of skin, oozes, then scans. It's very unattractive and painful. I will definitely not be using it on my chin anymore, but it's probably still okay for one application on stronger areas of skin. I do have very sensitive skin, so this probably isn't the same problem others have."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Sunday Riley Good Genes lactic acid treatment but yikes it's expensive. After reading some info on the internet, I decided to try this since it's about 10% of the cost of SRGG! The formula is very different. This one is watery whereas SRGG is a cream. SRGG ""soaks in"" and feels like a moisturizer while this one feels slightly tacky after it dries. I feel a little tingling sometimes with this one, but no tingling with SRGG. I think they have similar results - my skin feels really soft after both.

I love SRGG and also their Luna sleeping oil. If I had to choose which one to get the authentic one, I would choose Luna oil because the closest dupe out there isn't even close. The Ordinary Lactic Acid gets similar results as Good Genes. It's harder to apply and feels kind of sticky, but for the price difference I can deal with that."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Thin consistency. Slight tingle, so I know I am getting the exfoliation I want. This product can be used daily or every other day if your skin is familiar with lactic acid. I actually use the 30% peel for about 45 minutes once a week, then this about 4 - 5 times a week day + night (never with retinol) and I have noticed a difference in dark, purple acne scars. They have lightened to a more pink shade and are easier to cover with makeup. I have also noticed a significant difference in actual breakouts. I like to put this on first on clean, toned skin as I find the lactic acid allows my serum to absorb deeper. Then I use a few drops of oil on top before doing makeup. This is decent and does the job."

It is a good product but not for my personal concerns. I have keratosis pilaris on my face, and I had read this was good for it. It did make the texture of my skin a little smoother but other then that, not much. It does make my skin feel tight/dry after I put it on and I have dry skin already so I add a serum on top and a moisturizer."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,I first tried 1x a week and it seemed good.

Same time being sure to protect my skin with sunblock due to the increased risk of sun damage with a sensitizing product such as this.

The product is the right color and the packaging has no flaws or doubts. The quality and workmanship also seems to be correct.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, you can't really beat The Ordinary for great products at really low prices, and this (to me) has been one of the best I've ever bought from them. I'm 49 and desperately looking for non-surgical ways to reverse time which is obviously ridiculous, but I suppose we all live in hope. That said, I've been using this product nightly for about a month now and my skin definitely looks better. I've still got a few lines and it hasn't reduced them, but the clarity and texture of my skin has absolutely changed for the better. If you look at this as a preventative step, rather than something that will reverse time, you can't really go wrong. I do wish I'd started using stuff like this 10 years ago, but hey ho, live and learn. And you don't need to use much of it - I've still got a bit more than half the bottle left and I've probably been a bit heavy handed with it. A little really does go a long way with this stuff. This is definitely going on my list of 'must haves' for the future."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Being an acid, however, it is always important to be careful if you have delicate skin. Applied consistently as indicated, I noticed that in the early days my skin had blackheads and pimples under the skin that were more obvious but also easier to clean. I occasionally do spot on treatments on the areas that interest me, such as the nose and chin, because I avoid areas that are already healthy and can still get irritated. I noticed a good improvement on the dark areas of old acne scars, but not so much on the narrowing of the pores."

I have since started purchasing the product in store and have found the same color variations. The bottle I purchased here seemed to work great and just as well as the in store purchases. Only problem is that the price here is almost twice what you would pay compared to buying from most brick and mortar options.

I have had excellent results in seeing a smoothing of my skin, reduction of black heads, and an overall improvement in color consistency in my skin (reduced redness around nose and on forehead). I would consider myself to have sensitive skin and I didn’t have any issues with this product. Of course, it’s impossible to predict how each individual would react."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Yeah, it kinda works. Although, it never reduced the texture 100 %, my skin felt very clean and soft afterwards. If you have dry spots, this makes it flare up. Also, after some regular use, my skin built up debris a lot faster, which for me was not the goal. If you don't have difficult skin like mine then this will probably work fine for you."

You will LOVE this acid. It will change your skins texture, appearance and pores are tight. My acne is clearing up. It happened extremely fast. I had a really bad break out for months from trying to get in a tretinoin/ retin A routine. My face looked worse than ever and I'm in my 30's. Adult breakouts suck. These acids all the AHA's lactic acid, glycolic acid in combo with a benzol peroxide acne free line have changed my skin. I apply the acid at night with a hydroquinone 2% lightening cream that also has small amounts of lactic and glycolic acid. If you also get the acnefree system DONT USE STEP 4 OF THE ACNE FREE. it is retinol and if you have sensitive skin like me it will destroy you. This combination is amazing for me because I have sensitive skin that easily has a breakout. These together almost immediately did what I have tried to use retin A for almost a year. My skin is dewy, tight and clear. I'm so thankful I did some research and found out about using acids. It has saved my skin. I hope this can help someone who is tired of dealing with the depressive self conscious feeling from the breakout."

I’ve tried multiple skincare products from brands such as Paula’s Choice, CosRX, Timeless, Missha, La Roche Posay, and much more ranging to $50 max. This is definitely a multitasker for my combination, acne-prone, sensitive, and redness-prone teenage skin. I just use this one product every night and I put the amount of AHA liquid concentrate from one whole pipette because I slowly adapted my skin to this serum. Then I topped the serum off with a gentle lotion (I use Bioderma Intensive) and that’s it. I find myself not reaching for other facial products I have in hand because this is all I need every night. When I wake up in the morning, my complexion is bright and I my pimples are kept at bay. Because this serum makes the skin sensitive to the sun, I put some light sunscreen from La Roche Posay, Innisfree, or Apieu during the day."

I was looking for something that would be hydrating for my skin and help with redness. It is very moisturizing, doesn't dry out my skin, and I like mixing a couple drops with my vitamin c serum when I put it on my face. I noticed that the properties help with dry rough skin and I tend to get some ezcema-like patches on the backs of my hands; when I put this on them, I usually notice the redness quiets down significantly within the next day or so. It does have a burning sensation sometimes when I put it on, but it's acid so that's to be expected. I will definitely continue to buy this product."

No amount of toning or moisturizing has changed that so I decided to buy this. I've used this product one time so far and my face already feels smoother and fresher. I use to get dry ice treatments at my dermatologist's office and this is what my face felt like afterwards! My skin feels cleaner, tighter, and soft as silk. My skin doesn't look so ""tired"" anymore. It's only a slight difference so far but I'm hoping after a week or two my skin will look even better.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the ordinary and this was sold out everywhere and could only find it on Amazon. I didn’t get to use it for long before stripping down my skincare routine to the basics because of acne forming from wearing a mask. It wasn’t due to this product but I look forward to giving it a real try later on. The Consistency was a little thicker than water and sunk right into my skin which was great. I intend to use it in my regular AM routine

I have been using this product for literally less than a year and while my skin is and looks GREAT I actually started seeing a change after only 2-3 weeks, super fast if you're consistent.

My routine is once a day (normally in the morning): wash skin, use the Lactic Acid and then use a normal facial moisturizer after. That easy."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a sample of this product in my Birch Box and after using it for a few days, I LOVED the way my face felt. It was soft, the black heads were cleared up and my skin had no more acne. It may take time for me to see any results regarding wrinkles and the fine lines my forty something skin has collected over the years, but I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone that struggles with blackheads and or acne."

I used to sell high end, luxury skincare for Nordstrom and this product is just as effective as those products for literally 10x less the cost. I noticed a big difference after just one use. I had little bumps on my forehead- gone in one night. Noticeable diminishing of fine lines on my forehead. Even the broken capillaries on my forehead looked less irritated. (My forehead is my problem area, haha!) over all my skin is softer and has a better level of clarity. Highly, highly recommend!"

I use this every other night and mix it with my Curology (if you have ance/skin issues, look up this service!!!) and it gives the greatest chemical exfoliation I've had. A dupe for Sunday Riley's Good Genes. I will keep using this as long as they make it. Finally, a company that charges fair prices for their skin care products! Google and find this for $6.75 through a different website (though it's $5 shipping, so just order a couple!)"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I originally got this because I ran out of my other chemical exfoliant and thought I'd try this after reading so many rave reviews. I was a little worried about it being too harsh for my skin (I have sensitive skin) but it was only tingling for 20 seconds max. It does say on the packaging that it's normal to feel a tingling sensation and it should go away. I love this product and I can see why it's gotten such great reviews.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have really large pores and this took close to 3 weeks of using nightly to see a change.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%, High-Strength Exfoliating Serum for Smoother, Brighter Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is incredible. Within a few days of use, I have noticeably softer, clearer skin. I use a few drops nightly on my neck and chest. Even with sensitive skin, the formulation is gentle enough that it doesn’t irritate me, and the addition of HA helps my skin retain moisture throughout the day. My friends have commented on the almost immediate change in my complexion. I do pair this with sunscreen as summer is now approaching."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA, Brightens Skin and Targets Dark Spots",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"My first product by the ordinary and man its been a huge mistake.
I dont know what it is about this product that my skin hates so much because before using it i used to get maybe 4-5 pimples a month totally at most but the problem was scarring and I wanted to use this to deal with that.
Once I started using it though, my skin was like a cobblestone foot path in terms of bumpiness in a matter of days.
I took to the internet to see if others were in the same boat and was informed of the term ""purging"" which means it can take upto to months for my skin to purge all the acne deep under my skin to the surface and get rid of them once and for all.
So despite my best judgement, I stuck with it afterall I am no expert but 3 months and no signs of stopping, I officially give up. I have way more acne scars now than when I started :(
Im going to try Niacinamide next, and I suggest you do so too! No purging bs with that one, Ive read."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA, Brightens Skin and Targets Dark Spots",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm so conflicted with how many stars to give this. I need to say - I LOVE how this feels. It feels super hydrating while being really light, I put it on usually right after I wash my face, and while it's slightly sticky, as soon as I put some lotion over top of it that goes away. It has a very mild and unoffensive smell.

However. It didn't do much for evening out or brightening my problem areas, but I'm not sure the marks I have are marks that alpha arbutin would work on anyway, so it's not entirely fair to rate it on that. That said, I would like to see it be a little higher percentage as some other products have.

Even despite that though, I'm tempted to repurchase it anyway just because I like it so much."

But my view on high end-serums have been restored thanks to The Ordinary Serums overall. My uneven skin colour starts to fade out slowly yet very surely. Will definitely buy this again! Wish it was more cheaper (I know it's because of customs and since it is imported). Nevertheless, it's a great product. I've been applying it specifically around my darker areas in my face. Really wish the cost rate would not inflate as much after few months!"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA, Brightens Skin and Targets Dark Spots",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When used with other The Ordinary products I have seen much improvement in my hyperpigmentation over the course of the past 2 months!! Use with vitamin c (I use Timeless brand for c but the rest is The Ordinary), niacinamide, and azelic acid for awesome results!!! Don't forget the high SPF while using all of these products or you will end up worse than you started!!! If you need this product, you also need to wear high physical (not chemical) spf on your face 24/7/365...unless you are inside and there is no light coming in from any windows!!!! Hyperpigmentation is all about sun exposure and heat in the skin. Chemical sunscreens react in your skin creating heat which can also make hyperpigmentation worse, which is what I experienced...just like the research says. Also, chemical sunscreens allow sun to absorb into your skin, but physical sunscreen reflects the sun. As soon as I started with religious application of 30-50spf in only physical sunscreen form, all hyperpigmentation stopped getting worse. Now The Ordinary is helping me correct the damage that was done before my new sunscreen rituals!!!!"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA, Brightens Skin and Targets Dark Spots",,5.0 out of 5 stars,On the recommendation of the Gothemista from Youtube (skincare product reviews and advice Vlogger) I started this product January 24th. Today is valentines day and all my spots are starting to fade. I initially dabbed on a thin layer a bit here and there for about a week. The second week I looked in my high magnification mirror Conair Oval Shaped Double-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror; 1x/7x magnification; Oiled Bronze Finish and immediately noticed several of my sun spots and hyperpigmentation areas were shades lighter and starting to break up. Some spots are shrinking around the edges as well as becoming lighter. The vlogger I follow used it for several months and found significant improvement on her own complexion. If your not ready to shell out the money for the fraxel laser then pick up one of these nifty bottles and make it part of your daily skin care practice.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% in Squalane, Intermediate Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Box arrived a little crumpled, but came in its own soft envelope so I get that.

The actual real concern is that there’s no safety seal on the box, nor on the bottle. The bottle dropper opened/“unscrewed” with zero resistance or “click” like most products do. Unsure if that’s an Ordinary brand standard or what… but that is weird and definitely doesn’t make me confident to use the product. First impressions are that since there’s no safety seals at all anywhere on the product, that it’s not tamper proof, it could have been bought then used then returned, or even refilled with any oil then returned to be re-shelved and resold, or what have you. I contacted customer service and while they were so helpful, they weren’t sure about product seals either. I’ll continue to search for an answer from The Ordinary company themselves.

This is my first experience and purchase with The Ordinary ever, so I’m not super impressed right off the bat. But I got this retinol .5% on a little sale, so I may try it as a “patch test” first and go from there.

I’m hoping that The Ordinary will start to seal up their packages for better product integrity and costumer confidence!! It’s not *ordinary* for non-tamper-proof skincare or cosmetic products at all!! Not sure if they have me as a repeat customer yet."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% in Squalane, Intermediate Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"EDIT: I really dislike this product. It gave me way more acne than i started with. What I mean is, before I used this, I had 1 or 2 pimples. After using it for 6 weeks, I got rather severe acne. Breaks outs everywhere. Not a purge, but a full on breakout. I got acne on areas of my face that I never got acne before. It was a nightmare. I am now using Curology, and that seems to be taking my newly severe acne down a notch.

I am uncertain about this product. I have been using it for almost 3 weeks now. My pores might look a little smaller, but other than that I am not too sure if it is working. I use it every other night. If i use it every night, I break out more. Every other night doesn't make me break out more than usual, but i still have acne in my troubled areas. I don't have any redness or irritation though. If there are any great changes in the future, I'll come back and edit my review"

I was already using a retinol cream and figured this was a cheaper alternative with pretty good reviews. I understand there may be a purging period but I was already using retinol before trying this.

Besides that, I didn't notice any big changes in my skin thanks to this oil, I think I need 1% instead.

I bought second bottle with higher retinol percentage which is this but both 0.2 and this make my skin to have some big bumps under the skin that hurted a lot. They were so big and because lasted me for more than 2 weeks I went to dermatologist to check my self for cancer. I did not knew this product is causing me this untill i stopped using it. Face looks much better with retinol but the bumps that appeared are something that I never experienced in my life. Trust me I tried a lot of products but I never experienced something that painfull, sored and scary. Last time I used this after a 2 months break and one bump appeared on my eyebrow. My eye was swollen and red and the next thay blueish. U can try it cause its really cheap but stop immediately if u notice something painfull, otherwise u will be left will scars on your face from those scary bumps.
Ps: No other retinol caused me this reaction."

But retinol is supposed to be “irritating” at first glance. However, I put it on every night, without moisturizer afterwards (so greasy), and I felt NO effect

So basically I have oily and very thick skin and therefore certainly less sensitive than thin skin, but I still expected to feel something

May cause you to breakout for the first 2-3 weeks but that’s only because it’s bringing all those hidden pimples to the surface, but after that I saw a noticeable difference in the evenness of my skin tone. It does feel very oily on the skin though so I would not suggest this particular product if you have already oily skin. I would say the only major downside is that it has a very strange smell? It’s not strong or anything but when I put it on my face I can definitely smell it and I would not describe it as pleasant. It goes away after rubbing it into the skin but I figure for those that are sensitive to smells it would be good to know."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% in Squalane, Intermediate Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"My skin type: mixed (oily T-zone, with slightly open pores in front and nose); first wrinkles.

Goal I was looking for: smooth wrinkles, close pores, improve overall skin appearance.

Application of the product: every night after cleansing and tonic, adding moisturizer after.

Results: after only a week using it I can say that the appearance of the skin has improved considerably (more radiance, the complexion seems thinner); wrinkles have not disappeared but they do look less (because the skin is softer); the pores of the forehead have been slightly reduced. When I apply it to the skin I notice a VERY slight burning sensation (but there is no reddening at the moment or posteriori, nor peeling).

Opinion: The product seems to work after 1 week of application (better looking skin, less visibility wrinkles, closer pores); the application is comfortable by the dispenser; the product is very oily and leaves the feeling of wearing oil on your face when you use it (but it has not caused me pimples or fat bounces)."

Spoiler alert, it's not for all skin types, it was very DISAPPOINTING.
The Retinol 5% is supposed to work to regulate the sebum of the skin but the oily consistency of the serum, which had already improved a lot using another brand, produced the appearance of pimples, blackheads and worsened the appearance of the sebaceous filaments .
Niasinamide 10% and Zinc 1% have a hated, soapy consistency. After a week my skin became very irritated and I had to suspend it. Looking for more information I came to learn that this percentage of Niasinamide with Zinc can cause the opposite of what it should, it breaks the normal protective barrier of the skin.
I do not intend to use this brand again."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% in Squalane, Intermediate Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% in Squalane is an effective, budget-friendly retinol product that has delivered noticeable results for my skin, but there’s one big drawback that keeps it from being perfect.

Pros:

Affordable: High-quality retinol at a fraction of the cost of similar products.
Effective: Helped smooth my skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines over time.
Gentle formula: The squalane base is hydrating and minimizes irritation compared to other retinol products.

Cons:

Ingredient concern: The inclusion of BHT (a preservative) is disappointing. I prefer products without this additive, as there’s some debate about its safety in skincare and ability to disrupt the endocrine system.

Overall, while the performance and price are excellent, I’m hesitant to repurchase due to the BHT. If this doesn’t concern you, it’s a fantastic choice for incorporating retinol into your routine."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% in Squalane, Intermediate Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a reaction to this product. I applied to my face for a week or so, and at first, it seemed to cause a healing reaction where my skin was cleansing, pushing things out and it actually caused some acne. But I knew this was part of the process and it was for the better. My skin did improve and seemed to tighten and firm just like I wanted it to, but the unfortunate part was that I began to experience pretty pronounced dry eye symptoms.

These symptoms lasted a few weeks and went away. I was worried that I had permanently harmed my meibomian glands (the oil glands in your eyelids that moisturize your eyes.) This is apparently a side effect that a certain percent of people experience with retinoids.

I have to say, I'm upset that I can't use this product because I understand the mechanism that makes it effective. I must be one of the people who don't tolerate it well. I am considering grabbing the 0.1% retinol from The Ordinary and trying that some day in the future.

For those who are experiencing dry eye from retinol and are worried that it'll last forever like I was... for me, it did not! I STOPPED the retinol immediately when I realized what was happening. It took about 2-3 weeks for the symptoms to go away. I also apply castor oil to my face and my eyelashes, so I think that kind of helped moisturize my eyes to deal with the dry eye temporarily. Now I'm back to normal!

4/5 for the product, I just wish I could tolerate it!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% in Squalane, Intermediate Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really love this formula, the squalane gives it a nice silky texture. I have combination mature skin, however I think someone with very oily skin may find this product oily and will not appreciate the squalene I think Combination and drier skin types will like this formula. When I started using this product I knew it would come with its side effects.(Hence why I prefer the Niacinamide no side effects)
I use this 3 times for the week once a day. To be very honest I cannot bear the side effects of mild tingling and sensitivity, even though I cover with Cerave Moisterizing cream after ON THE FACE AND NECK AREA. Applying Niacinamide before will help but I am 1 serum girl, I really don’t want to have to apply more than 1 at a time. As well cutting down on how often you use it will cut down side effects, but call me fussy I want something I can apply nightly with no problem. However with that being said, I have Keratosis Pilaris on my arms and loving it on that area. After only after 2 weeks of using this at night on my arms there was a mild improvement and with continued use just got better. Also I have used this on my stretch marks and have brightened the area So while I am not sure I will use this on my face I am loving it on my KP on arms feels comfortable and stretch marks"

I followed the instructions carefully since I knew retinol could cause some skin irritations.

I didn't notice immediate changes in my skin but after numerous weeks of using it I believe my skin looks smoother with the wrinkles not as noticeable. I'm in my early 60's so I use the retinol with other products to help my skin and I believe it's an ongoing process to fight aging.

The last one is me made up. I feel like my pores and overall texture of my skin is improved.
I was able to go into using this basically once a day immediately because I was using Olays purple rentiol night cream prior to(idk how much retinol is in that product but it may help to transition into actual rentiol treatment). I had no dryness, peeling or serious breakouts. No complaints on scent either.
I have to say I’m not the best at washing my face if I’m not showering so my nightly routine at bare minimum(cuz working 2 jobs as a single mom means we ain’t got time for much more than that) is remove the makeup, rentiol oil to soak in for about 15 min, then moisturize(store brand cetaphil). Always making sure to put spf primer on in the am before makeup as well(elf suntouchable).
I’m about a month into this routine with no complaints. Hope this review helps y’all!"

Great product so far that hasn't caused me any irritation. I was expecting this to be harsh for my skin because I've never used a retinol before and after buying it I read that you're really supposed to start with the 0.2% retinol solution. Even though I jumped to this one and I have dry skin, I haven't noticed significant irritation. I use a light moisturizer before I use this at night and then a deeper moisturizer after to be safe. What I have noticed is that after a week's use (every 3 days at night) along with vitamin c+e (every morning), is that my skin feels softer and pores seem much smaller already. Serums like this are the only products where I seem to see almost instant results. Definitely worth the money."

The only thing I would say is that it takes a long time to actually absorb into my skin and then put moisturizer as my last step. It takes a while in between I can do those but for the price and for everything else, I don’t think I’m gonna be looking for another retinol for quite some time."

No sunscreen and living by the pool and at the beach so I have to really try to find affordable skincare products. The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% product is thick and leaves my skin dewy and vibrant and my 18 yr old daughter who takes very good care of her skin said she wanted her skin to look like mine. I thought I was hearing things. But she said mom whatever your doing is working I highly recommend this product I use it on my chest hands are and sometimes on my legs and tummy after a bath it's very thick and only takes a small amount so I once a week use it on my body it fells so good.

I just finished the bottle, so it lasted a long time.

As you can see, my red spots have faded DRAMATICALLY! I don’t get cystic acne anymore because of this product, however I still have some texture and white heads. This is a lower strength retinol, so now that I have finished this product I am graduating to the 1% version of this product to really target the texture.

I did purge at the beginning but it was SO worth it! Sunscreen is a MUST with any retinol and I found that to be true with this product, my skin would get red on days I forgot sunscreen. Amazing product and results I can't wait to use the 1%.

Would recommend!"

My pores have shrunk, my skin is much softer, my skin actually glows, and not from it being oily, it really is a great product overall.

It tries hard to be, but it’s not the real product. It even says “test on humans” on the bottle. Do not buy. I regret my purchase bc I stored it away and no longer can get a refund."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Masque, Clarifying Charcoal & Clay Mask for Blemish-Prone Skin, 1.7 Fl Oz",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to like this product since I’ve been hearing so many good things about it. But, stupid me so excited to try it that I didn’t even do a patch test, and got myself an allergy reaction. I did everything besides the patch test and put it on my face and waited 10 min. And mind you it was the longest 10 minutes ever! I started noticing some slight discomfort maybe 3 minutes after I put it on. I thought it was just the products itself working you know, since it’s Salicylic Acid. 5-6 minutes past and my skin is really tingling, burning and itching so bad and again I ignored it and thought maybe the product is really strong (wrong decision). 10 minutes is finally up and I couldn’t run fast enough to the bathroom to get it off my face. It was itching and burning so bad that I was scrubbing my face hard to get it off, and bam! both of my cheeks is really swollen and red 😞 I’d never have any allergy reaction before and since I’d read so many good reviews that I thought it’s going to be one of those perfect skin care products for me, sadly that’s not the case. So, please do a patch test first before you use it just to make sure! I love The Ordinary but this one is not just for me."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Masque, Clarifying Charcoal & Clay Mask for Blemish-Prone Skin, 1.7 Fl Oz",,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY! I saw the reviews about half-filled bottles. I was hoping I would be lucky and not get one of the defective items...wrong! It literally has not been opened because I have been so angry at the lack of product actually in the container. Did not realize there were no returns prior to purchase otherwise I would not have taken the gamble. Clearly there is a quality control issue that they are not willing to address so now I am not willing to risk putting it on my face.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Masque, Clarifying Charcoal & Clay Mask for Blemish-Prone Skin, 1.7 Fl Oz",,1.0 out of 5 stars,I do not recommend this product as a face mask as it burns your skin. I tried it 4 times. The first time I used it I loved it and it felt refreshing. I used it for the 4th time in about 3 months and my skin was left BURNING. It was so painful as I rinsed it off. Quality skin care products do not burn you. Spot treatments for bad acne I’m sure would be fine but not a full mask.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Masque, Clarifying Charcoal & Clay Mask for Blemish-Prone Skin, 1.7 Fl Oz",,4.0 out of 5 stars,I was surprised to see that this product is a charcoal black because I don’t recall seeing that anywhere on the packaging but I do really like this mask for the evenings. I’m happy it’s clay and not a peel off so it feels nice and gentle when applying and removing the mask also I ONLY applied on my problem areas rather than my entire face. I made sure to not leave it on for more than 10 minutes so I didn’t have any redness or irritation! I LOVE how this product does not have any harsh chemicals in the ingredients but it does have a very mild off-scent - it’s nothing “fresh” per say which I don’t mind because this kind of product doesn’t need any kind of fragrance added to it. I followed up with vitamin E oil for extra motorization and hydration.

Sure it gets blackheads and such sebaceous filaments out my nose but speaking from my experience, it didnt get much out. It left many blackheads and filaments and also left my nose extremely textured. I used it after a gentle cleanser that was pretty good at handling my blackheads and filaments but just not to the desired extent but it still wasnt as good as i heard. I kind of wish i could go back in time and stop myself and look for different solutions and methods but i guess this is ok for now."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Masque, Clarifying Charcoal & Clay Mask for Blemish-Prone Skin, 1.7 Fl Oz",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The utility of this product is reasonable but it works very slowly. You use it once every week, so don't expect to get the result drastically. One tube can be used for approximately 8 weeks. As the process is slow, you don't know how many of these you need before you can see improvement. If you have very sensitive skin, the process might be even slower for you. Also, it doesn't do a very good job for moisturizing. In a nutshell, you can use it but you have to be patient with it."

With that said the tube was fine and not damaged.

I have since updated my review to a four star after the recipient has tried the product and vouched for its quality. Skin visibly smoother and to the touch. Also slightly helped with rosacea."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Masque, Clarifying Charcoal & Clay Mask for Blemish-Prone Skin, 1.7 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One use and my skin is silky smooth to touch and has a light shiny glow. I have mild adult acne, mostly around mu chin and cheeks and its hormonally based and sometimes cystic. I tend to get black heads or pimples deep under the skin. Up Until now I have used the Murad Intensive-C Radiance glycolic gel cream peel to exfoliate once a week. That works ok but its $50 and I researched that Salicylic acid delves deeper into oily/acne prone pores to clean them out. I love alot of the Ordinary's products and this is a HIT! I've used this twice and its been a dream. My skin is already showing less and less black heads, texture and those under the skin pimples that havent quite come up yet. I was a little nervous at first at the idea of using a clay mask. I have used them in the past and they really do bring acne up and out to the surface. This mask seems to do the opposite! Skin is so SOFT, SUPPLE AND GLOWY! I realize that the Ordinary is known for using natural moisturizing factors like Squalene, glycerine and hyaluronic acid- all known for hydration. This mask has the first two, so skin doesnt feel tight or dry after washing off. When using this its a black creamy consistency and over the ten minutes it tightens on the face only to leave it soft and moisturized after washing off. Over all I LOVE THE PRICE, just PLEASE MAKE THIS IN A LARGER SIZE!!!!!"

I’m 14 and I have acne around the contour of my cheeks and get black/white heads on my nose. I don’t have have sensitive skin I have oily dehydrated skin. Took me 3min to apply. It has a grainy texture. Feels cool on the skin. Has a faint smell. Gets tight as it drys but will still be able to eat while wearing it. Melts right off with lukewarm water. Leaves skin feeling instantly soft must moisturize after not because is drying but because your skin must be moisturized no matter what. Skin looked dewy after moisturizer was applied.
Package review:
Product came with 80% of product and 20% air as some reviewers said but is fine with me. Has foil sealing which prevents from tampering and spillage. Box came with a dent but did not harm product inside. Box also has a velvet texture which is nice. ◞(⚭⃚⃙͐·̫⚭⃚⃙͐)˩✧"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Masque, Clarifying Charcoal & Clay Mask for Blemish-Prone Skin, 1.7 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This mask works great. I've been doing a number of things to treat face mask acne on my chin (sigh, a sign of the covid times), and this acne mask really did the trick. I've only used it once so far, but it penetrated deeply and dried out some cystic stuff that's been giving me woes. It's drying, so only apply where needed, I did it from nose to chin and left my blemish free forehead alone. My cons are that it's not free, and the weight of the fill seems light to me. A lot of extra space in the tube. Pro is that it works! And it can be used sparingly. Good stuff. Have your moisurizer ready, you will experience some peeling the next day."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolipid Cream Cleanser, Gentle Makeup Removal with Plant-Derived Glycolipid Agents, 5.1 Fl Oz",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've never tried The Ordinary brand of skin care, so I was really curious about this cleanser. With cleansers I prefer ones that leave my skin clean with a fresh feeling but without dryness or tightness. This one delivered on most of those.

This cleanser goes on creamy. It isn't one to lather or foam. It didn't take very much product to do the job, which is good as it makes it a better value. There was a cooling sensation while using. It went on evenly and smoothly and rinsed off well.

My face felt clean and refreshed immediately after using. It had a coolness to it. I wasn't wearing any make-up, so I can't say whether it removes makeup residue easily or not. However, shortly after use and for the next hour or so my face felt tight. I purposely did not use any moisturizer to see what the effect would be, so this tightening is contributed solely to the cleanser. It doesn't necessarily feel dry, but I didn't care for the tightness which happened with or without moving my face; it's like a slight pulling.

Overall, it's a fairly decent value considering it doesn't take a lot of product. It does cleanse well and leaves the face feeling refreshed. Sadly, it did have significant tightening after use on my normal to dry skin. Oily skin may have a different result."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolipid Cream Cleanser, Gentle Makeup Removal with Plant-Derived Glycolipid Agents, 5.1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the price compared to the results. Such a clean feeling, goes on smooth, wipes off easily and feels good to the skin."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolipid Cream Cleanser, Gentle Makeup Removal with Plant-Derived Glycolipid Agents, 5.1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Ordinary Glycolipid Cream Cleanser is absolutely fantastic! This cleanser has become an essential part of my skincare routine. It’s incredibly gentle yet effective at removing makeup and impurities without stripping my skin. The plant-derived glycolipid agents work wonders – my skin feels soft, clean, and refreshed after every use. As someone who has started developing rosy cheeks due to Rosacea, cleansers tend to make the redness flare up. After using this cleanser I've noticed the usual redness several shades paler. The more I use it the paler it gets. While not gone entirely it is FAR better than it was. It may not work on everyone, but for me, that alone is worth the investment. And it's not even that much since The Ordinary is fantastically affordable. I have several of their products already and am happy to add this one to the lineup."

I have very sensitive skin and used to have the hardest time finding products that agree with my face, then I found The Ordinary.
I have so many products of theirs and this one is just as amazing as the others.
It’s my first time using face wash on dry skin and I was worried that it might not remove all the dirt and make up but I was mistaken, it gently cleanses my face and leaves my face feeling soft and clean.
Usually when I wash my face, my face would feel extremely dry after and my rosacea would flare up, but this face wash calms my skin and makes it less red and look and feel healthy!
The bottle itself is very large and you only need a little bit of product so this will last you a while plus, like so many other The Ordinary products, the price for this face wash is extremely reasonable but will give you major effects!

Love!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Glycolipid Cream Cleanser, Gentle Makeup Removal with Plant-Derived Glycolipid Agents, 5.1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a creamy cleanser. It does not foam but feels more like an old-fashioned cold cream when I apply to my dry face (per package directions). However, it feels much lighter/less greasy than a cold cream. It has enough moisturizers to be gentle on my somewhat sensitive and now winter-dry skin. It rinses off easily with a few splashes of warm water. My combination type skin is left feeling thoroughly cleansed but not too dry. I also have never had any kind of irritation or reaction after using this.

This cleanser does its job well at a value price."

It felt cooling on the skin, did not leave any type of irritation/redness, and after several days of use my skin feels noticeably more clear while not being dried out. I'm really happy with this, and think I've finally found my replacement for my discontinued go to cleanser (Neutrogena pore reduction cleanser).

The serum has not caused any breakouts yet but did help control my oil better than other serums I've tried (I have an oily face). The serum works great by itself already but definitely works best if followed up by moisturizer. So far after a week of use it has controlled my breakouts pretty good and hopefully it will continue to work as time goes on."

I am in my mid 40s, fair-skin and prone to mild redness particularly after drinking alcohol or with heat. The lactic acid product is less than amazing.

I have sensitive skin so I started out using this only once a week because I didn't want it to cause redness or peeling. Within the first week of using it I started noticing I was breaking out in acne. I thought maybe it was hormonal acne or just a coincidence so I kept using it, but I continued to notice more and more bumps. Once I stopped using it, my skin started clearing up. I guess my skin just doesn't like it. I've seen amazing results using a Retinol though so I'll just stick to that. I also really love the Nip+Fab glycolic extreme night pads.

Lactic acid brings the acne up faster so I never don’t have acne. I still have black heads and my pores got bigger. There was less redness in my skin but after a day of walking around I still get red anyways. Overall, it helped my skin to a certain extent but I could live without it.

Also, they recommend you dilute it first in order for your skin to get used to it. It didn’t take me long to get used to it but that just meant that I used up the tiny bottle faster. It’s also very watery. I really loved it at first but I’ve become pretty disappointed. It’s good for less Oily skin types and it’s best if you already have clear skin."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2%, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Smoother Skin",,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have bad skin that's dry and lots of acne. I would sometimes get flaky skin on my nose in the winter I always use salicylic acid every day but it only helps my acne and isn't too effective for exfoliating i thought lactic acid would help get rid of the flakes. It did work well with the flakes but it made my acne worse so I stopped using it. A few weeks ago I decided I would see if it did anything to my ingrown hairs. It works very well as a gentle exfoliator down there I use it the day before I shave and have noticed a significant reduction of ingrowns! Yay! Glad I found a use for it.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2%, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my skin after my 2nd pregnancy, I noticed postpartum my skin had more of those weird bumps that aren’t pimples but add texture to your skin. I’ve always had clear skin so I noticed these bumps and researched exfoliation serums I had them on my cheeks, and the back of my arms. I used this serum on my face one night and the next day 90% of the bumps were gone. I tried it on the back of my arms where the bumps were, and next day I showered and so much skin flaked off and most of the bumps are gone. It’s pretty incredible. I’m also using it on my postpartum belly and stretch marks to help regenerate the skin alongside retinol (not at the same time.) I have also used it on my foot calluses which are not severe. I do use an SPF of 45 with these products."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2%, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 1 oz/30 mL has been a game-changer in my skincare routine, offering gentle yet effective exfoliation and hydration.

What sets this product apart is its formulation: the 5% lactic acid concentration provides a mild exfoliation that helps to improve skin texture and tone without causing irritation. Lactic acid is known for its ability to gently slough off dead skin cells, revealing smoother and brighter skin underneath.

The addition of hyaluronic acid (HA) further enhances its benefits by attracting and retaining moisture, keeping my skin hydrated and plump after exfoliation. This combination makes it suitable for those with dry or dehydrated skin looking to improve overall skin health.

I've noticed visible improvements in the appearance of my skin since incorporating this product into my routine. My complexion appears more even, with reduced dullness and fewer texture issues over time.

The packaging is practical and hygienic, with a dropper that dispenses the perfect amount of product. It's also fragrance-free, which is ideal for sensitive skin types.

While it's important to start slowly with exfoliating products to avoid over-exfoliation, I've experienced no adverse reactions with this formula.

Overall, The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA is a fantastic option for anyone seeking a gentle yet effective exfoliating treatment that delivers noticeable results. It's affordable, easy to incorporate into a skincare regimen, and backed by The Ordinary's commitment to simplicity and transparency in skincare."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2%, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used this product the first night!! Let me tell you... the next morning I could tell the refreshes of my face. My face was a Lil red, but it's always that way. My face was bright for most of the day. You dont want to use this any other acid products. Make sure to Moisturize after you wash ur face, from having the acid toner on... that's very important. Using a V-C serum is good. That's what I use the next day, and a good moisturizer. Also you shouldn't use this acid toner every night. I guess yourself can be the judge. It's a really good product I think. Oh Lil goes a long way."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2%, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this latic acid. It's gentle yet effective and at its price point, it's 5 stars 🌟. Use it on damp skin and follow the directions. If you aren't used to exfoliaters like this- start at once or 2xs a week. I use it 3xs sometimes 4xs a week usually in the winter I use it more. Depending on how my skin is that week. I even use this woth retinol. Only bc I'm used to it. Don't do this if you,never used retinol or haven't built up the tolerance. I looked it up, you can do this only if it's a gentle latic acid and your skin,has built up a tolerance for both retinol and this. I use the latic acid and retinol only once* a week together** That's it! I see people spending so much on latic acid when I think it's better spend on your retinol/vitamin c or a good moisturizer/ eye cream. Don't mix with other aha/bha obviously or retinol (only if you built up a tolerance you can use together once a week) use this after your toner and or essence. After the latic acid use something that's hydrating like: ceramide serum like coco kind - panthenol serum from some by mi- Vichy 89- the purito centella serum - cosrx propolis serum- naturium barrier support serum-( i think thats what the name is) these are some of what I use after the latic acid to protect and hydrate my skin barrier, then top it with a hydrating moisturizer. You'll have the most plump and glowy skin in the morning. It's insane how it helps with texture, it exfoliates while leaving your skin so soft and no bad reactions since latic acid is the gentlest of acids✨️🌟✨️🌟✨️"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2%, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been struggling with tretinoin for years. Everyone says how important it is, but I was frustrated with the constant flaking, which I called ""face dandruff."" Not appealing! Well, it was a-peeling. I tried many exfoliants, including enzymes, scrubs, and a glycolic toner, but the toner was too harsh to use daily and the flaking persisted. My esthetician suggested a lactic acid, as it targets the surface skin and is gentler, so it could be used daily. Familiar with the Ordinary, I purchased this and have been using six nights per week, about an hour before applying the Retin-A. Flaking is gone and my skin is smooth!! I was about ready to give up on Retin-A, but this has fixed the problem. Already ordered another bottle."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2%, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've struggled with acne for decades now. It took me about that long to figure out that no soap or cleanser was ever going to work on my face and it took me just a little bit longer than that to figure out physical exfoliators were not the way to go.

As someone with acne, of course I've tried special cleansers and benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid and retinoid cream and basically all the normal suspects. My face always feels like it's flaking and cracking apart after only one use, even with the lowest concentration products I can find. It turns out using lactic acid really makes a difference. I can use this 2-3 times a week and my skin stays clearer, doesn't get dried out, and doesn't have flakes of dead skin everywhere.

I even discovered that if I spot treat a cystic pimple I can feel coming up with this 5-6 times a day, the pimple will retreat within a couple days instead of taking weeks to heal. I take oral medication for the acne, but it hasn't worked at the same concentration since my pregnancy and I still get the cystic suckers once or twice every month. This is the only external thing I've ever found that can actually help once they start forming.

These days I wash only with water and a gentle once-over with a cloth. I use this exfoliator every 2-3 days all over my face just before bed. I follow up with a drop or two of jojoba oil as a moisturizing barrier after every wash, except for under my eyes where lotion works much better. My skin looks as good as it probably ever will and I don't have to ride such a crazy rollercoaster of emotions about my acne.

It may not be the conventional advice or routine, but apparently my skin is a sensitive mf and it works for me. Something finally works for me."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2%, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve repurchased this a few times so I’m familiar with this product. It does a wonderful job at exfoliating my skin. I used this one day and the next I use a glycolic acid and continue this process everyday. This helps my skin turnover rate and my skin is so clear and smooth. I like that this has no scent and when I run out and stop using it my skin changes back to being clogged.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2%, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use the Lactic Acid every night and it seems to make a difference.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2%, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually only buy directly from deciem.com which is considerably a better price, more information and all of the ordinary products on the website. My toddler had gotten ahold of my previous bottle and dumped it, i needed more asap and didn’t want to wait for shipping. Going against my better judgment and fear after reading the other comments, i jumped the gun and ordered off amazon.
I am very happy i did and was overwhelmed with joy when my face felt instantly softer than before. I missed using it in my routine only 4 days, and after one use could tell the difference the next morning. Don’t listen to the negative reviews. This is 100% the real ordinary product and imo worth the extra money for the faster delivery not buying direct.

TLDR- 100% the deal"

My anxiety pushes me to pop and try to squeeze them. Then comes the black marks that never go away. I’ve been using Sulfur to bring them to a head, Oshun black soap to cleanse, ordinary lactic acid and rose hip oil. No more itchy face , I’ve only gotten 1 cyst this month prior to period ! 1 compared to 50 ! I believe the Acid helps to keep my skin clear and free of bacteria.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2%, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Smoother Skin",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's mild, just as the reviews mentioned, not irritating to my skin at all and not causing any hyper-pigmentation if I get sun exposure (i'm extra careful though). I have dry skin and was concerned that it would burn and dry out my skin even more, but not using it every night and using a moisturizer after it has dried/before i go to bed, seems to be working well for me. About 2 or 3 days after using it (2 nights in a row), i used cotton with a few drops of baby oil on it (coconut oil may be better) to gently exfoliate and the dead skin came of easily, leaving my face feeling nice and smooth. I plan on continuing this way until/unless the results change."

I typically have sensitive acne prone skin that’s dry & this has by far been the best cleanser for me. I gave 1 star for this product because I was so desperate to get this cleanser after running out & Ulta in my area not having it. I broke down & ordered even though Amazon only offered 1 option to buy. It was the smallest bottle for $15 when the bigger one is literally about $18 in stores. So after spending the most for this little bottle, I take it out the package, remove the seal for me to basically to see half the bottle was air!!

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is a fantastic cleanser but I cannot believe Amazon allows this seller to double the RRP. 100ml for this product is circa £20 max.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,2.0 out of 5 stars,My pores started to clog after two weeks of use. The first week of using this cleanser was great. My dry skin was gone and my complexion was smooth. The second week I started noticing clogged pores. The a couple of irritated pimples and discontinued.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This Hass to go to the list of the biggest let downs I’ve had so far with facial products. I have heard so many amazing things about this cleanser. And I’m thinking like OK this is gonna be gray, it might fill them up a little bit, it might be pretty thick to really do it’s job. It did the complete opposite. My skin has been so irritated for like the longest now since I’ve been using it. My skin burns in certain areas because of it. It does not so much one bit at all. And on top of that too it is so freaking sad that it literally just runs out of your hands. I am so disappointed. Do not get this item"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,2.0 out of 5 stars,I like the product but unfortunately this container does not contain the 50ml.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a good value... I unsealed the bottle, so I know this is the way they are filling it and not that some product was lost in shipping. They give you a large tube to make you feel like you are getting more than you are. From the first squeeze, I had to go down to the bottom quarter of the tube to get any product to come out. Even at that... It whistled at me (just the way it would when you are trying to get the last bits out of something almost empty.) Although I love the way this cleans, I will not buy it again.... There are better values out there. The Ordinary has really lost their identity and I hope they get it back. Providing quality ingredients at a great value and not chincing out on what they give the customer. Literally less than 10 washes in the tube..."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love The ordinary products, especially the serums and thats why I tried the face wash for the first time. however I was disappointed as it didn't do anything for my skin. After the first use my skin felt very dry although its combination skin. the formula is almost runny in consistency and feels like it has stripped the skin of necessary moisture. first and last purchase of the face wash for me."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,2.0 out of 5 stars,"As the name suggests, it cleans quite well, no smell. But I rather regret my purchase:
- already, for the price and quantity that it is! 30.36 euros an order for 150 ml is nothing at all. I thought it was a lot more mastoc, like in the photo!
- With 30.36 euros I do a lot of things in my life, I offer sushi to a Polish person, I take him camping with wild boars 🤡. It's way too expensive for what it is, even if quality can be an argument but all the same.
- the delivery time: I was supposed to receive it at the end of March, so that in the end I was told that I was going to have it a little late, with no fixed date. For 30.36 euros the order it was better to come quickly! SHAME! Then no message to know that it was delivered too...

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually use Burts Bees Soapbark face wash which is a miracle product for combination skin with an oily T zone. But I got bored so I tried this after hearing that squalene is a gentle cleanser. It works ok and IS gentle. Not sure it works as well as Burts Bees soapbark and there is less of it at about the same price. It feels like washing my face with oil and is less creamy. If your face is reacting to products or you think you should be using moisturizing oil on your skin, this is worth a try. If you have skin redness or breakage or crusty flakes around an oily nose, and boy do I ever, the Burts Bees facewash is creamier and heals my skin and lasts a long time. But The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser is a good moisturizer. Might use both as phases in a Korean skincare inspired routine. Burts Bees wins if I can have just one."

I purchased this cleanser and several other The Ordinary products (serums and toner) in the hopes that they might help even out my skin tone. The difference is AMAZING, even after the very first night of using the products. I am not exaggerating nor am I being given any type of consideration for this review. The Ordinary is one of those rare brands that REALLY does what it says AND is reasonably priced. I'm a customer for life! Highly recommend ANY of their products. This cleanser is a cream that you rub all over your face and then rinse off. It leaves no icky residue - just soft, clean skin."

I'm a 51 year old male who has an extremely pale complexion with rosacea. So, imagine how my super red cheecks stand out. This is the only face wash to actually work wonderfully for me.

I truly hope you have the same results as me."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love everything about the Ordinary products -- I started with the Hyaluronic Acid 2% and loved it so much I bought all the products. My skin never looked and felt better.

I'm on the older side and still have combination oily t-zone with all other areas dry. The cleanser, moisturizer and Hyaluronic Acid keep everything in balance. My skin looks brighter and smoother with -out any harsh side effects like redness or peeling.

The price is reasonable and excellent value. Also LOVE the size the products come in -- who wants a vat of moisturizer? They are on the smaller side so easily packable and I always feel like the product is fresh.

I'v a veteran of years of skin care regimens and I've been so satisfied. The Ordinary is anything but!!!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is easy to use, very moisturizing but leaves your face soft and non greasy when just wiped with a wet cloth. Takes off all make up, etc. Don't know about mascara. I use the tubular kind that comes off with warm water. I have very sensitive skin and it has never irritated it. This is the only cleanser I use."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit: Love the ordinary, but this is price gouging! The small one is $7 at Ulta and this large size is $20 from the manufacturer. It’s upsetting

This is by far my favorite cleanser. I love the way it makes my skin feel. I have been using it for about 6 months along with their moisturizer, vitamin C and hyaluronic acid. My skin is doing very well.I am so happy that a larger size is finally available. I buy 2 of the small ones from Ulta every 3 weeks. This one is 3 times the size, but 4 times the price so it’s a little more expensive than Ulta. It’s worth it to me because I get tired of running out especially with having to order online. Amazon is much faster."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is no scent to this face wash, and doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry. I have been using it for a while now and would recommend especially if you have dry skin!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the best facial wash. For a while, I didn’t read the instructions and put it on wet skin like I had previously done with other cleansers. It was okay but I was totally using it wrong. You basically rub it between your fingers and massage it onto dry skin, then rinse. I’ve never had just a facial cleanser remove makeup the way this does. Yes, if I’m going all out black Smokey eyes I’ll use another makeup remover before cleansing. But for my daily look, which includes eyeshadow and mascara, there isn’t any makeup left after this stuff. My skin feels very comfortable after cleansing too, not tight. And I’ve had zero breakouts since using it. I do now and again get dry patches but I use other products to combat that."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is gentle enough for mature skin without stripping moisture from your face.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been looking to get off Proactiv for a while and my good friend who is a make up artist recommended The Ordinary products. This product (and every product of theirs I’ve tried, really) has been AMAZING. I have not had ONE breakout since using this and my skin looks incredible. I have tried getting off Proactiv before using other products and ended up having to go back because nothing worked. But this actually does. I will never use another cleanser! Also, the instructions say to rub product in hands and apply to dry face-I thought this sounded strange but it really is the best way to use this product! LOVE The Ordinary and how affordable all of their high quality products are."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff is nice! I first used my sisters while searching for a makeup remover that won't dry out my already dry skin. It feels like rubbing butter on my face, which sounds odd to say, but feels really nice. It moisturizes my skin, but I still like to put my own moisturizer afterwards."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is 19.90 on their website, but you have to pay for shipping. I usually buy direct from them but they were sold out of the 150ml so I decided to order it from Amazon. This is a non-foaming cleanser which can take some getting used to if you are used to traditional cleansers, but it works well for my sensitive and dry skin. My usual routine is to use this as an all over makeup remover then cleanse with my usual Derma E cleanser. You really have to work this stuff in between your hands until the consistency changes to an oil which can take a minute."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love this face wash! It feels good going on and coming off. Removed make up easily. My skin feel better than ever after just a couple weeks of use.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really like this cleanser. Leaves face very moist.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really love this cleanser. I haven't used a cleanser like this before. It turns to oil and you massage it onto your dry skin. I have super sensitive dry skin that does not like artificial anything on it or else I break out. When I apply, I blot it all over and then rub it so I have full coverage. Then I use a rotating cleanser brush with some warm water and lightly scrub. It washes away with warm water very easily. If this keeps my skin clearer from my mild adult acne then I will forever use this!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have dry and occasionally sensitive skin, and I have tried a range of cleansers and I always come back to it because my skin loves a basic BASIC skin cleanser. For my skin type, I believe using a cleanser with no active ingredients is the best because it doesn't strip the skin, and the ph is pretty close to skin's normal ph which allows my acids and other products to really flourish vs using a cleanser loaded with acids and then continuing to add more acids on top."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This has become my favorite cleanser, but I have learned one thing about it. You have to sort of add a smidge water to it and mix it in your hands to get it to cover more area on yiur face. The tube it comes in doesn't have a lot for you to squirt a bunch on. I started purchasing from the brand's website because the price is far better and worth it if you can wait for shipping."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its great for dry mature skin!
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a fantastic product. I am always weary of skin products as I have VERY sensitive skin but this works great. However do not buy this on Amazon buy it from their website deciem you will get much better prices and shipping is free of you spend 25 dollars.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the only face cleanser that works for my face. I am acne prone with combination skin and this clears me right up. I use the same brand moisturizer and peeling solution as well. I absolutely love the ordinary with how simple their ingredients are. There is no fragrance or artificial coloring bull**** so you KNOW that this brand actually cares about your skin rather than brands that sell gimmicky “pretty” products for the $$.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the only cleanser I can use as a makeup remover for my highly sensitive skin. I use this then
Paula's Choice Skin Recovery Cream Cleanser and it's been my only cleansing routine that won't cause irritation. First bought a smaller size to test then purchased this size for value."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this cleanser! It has a unique oil/cream texture. USE ON DRY SKIN FIRST to remove makeup, even the most waterproof mascara. When you wet your face, it turns into a milky light cleanser. No ""soapy bubbles"" appear, but your face feels clean and hydrated. I originally bought a smaller sized tube at Ulta, but after I knew I loved it, I went ahead and got a big bottle! SAME exact product!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product cleans my face without drying it out.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a wonderful all purpose daily cleanser. I have mature skin that can feel dry & tight after washing off makeup & sunscreen at the end of the day with other cleansers but not with this one. After using this my skin is clean, soft & hydrated. This is the 2nd tube I've bought & I'm sure I will buy more when this is used up."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am loving this cleanser & a small amount does go a long way. My sensitive skin feels and looks more supple. I use with Buffet and Moisturizing Factor.
I do agree with others that the portion for this cleanser seems small - especially when other product sizes seem more plentiful. I still plan to re order..it's that good!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This cleanser clears all face make up easily and does not dry out your skin. It also has a very light amount of scrub beads in the product that also exfoliates with out irrigation.
For someone who gets pimples and redness from other products, this product is gentle and I have no irritation or break outs from it."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have sensitive skin that has been rather dry lately. I've been using this cleanser for about a week now and it removes my mascara and other makeup remarkably without irritating my skin. I can't say that about many products, so I'm pleasantly surprised. It's an exceptional cleanser for sensitive skin that is dry and I will never stop using it. I'm going to order another one so I don't run out of it."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this product, but using it morning and evening, it lasted less than two weeks! Guess I need to start ordering two at a time. Still less expensive than the product I was using."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is great for sensitive/ acne prone skin. I paired this with The Ordinary 3 pack (toner, ascorbic acid, hyaluronic acid) & my skin looks & feels so hydrated without over oiling. Super affordable too."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been looking & trying many cleansers for years hoping to find one that didn't dry my skin, but did control oil & cleaned my pores. I'm so happy I tried this, it's the best!! I will continue using this cleanser along with other products from this company."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can’t say enough good things about this cleanser. I love how it melts my makeup away and my face doesn’t feel dried out after washing like it does with pretty much every other cleanser. You can get it cheaper on the Ordinary’s website or Ulta.com, but if you’re in a hurry, paying extra to get quick shipping from Amazon is worth it."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Idk why but having to wet my face and then wash it is so much more of a hassle. This not only is extremely effective at removing makeup, but it also is a life-saver for those of us who are eternally lazy. I wash my face so much more now that I don’t have to wet it beforehand."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser, Hydrating Makeup Remover, Supports Moisture Barrier",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This cleanser leaves my face moisturized and clean. Use a dime size, rub it all around your face and it just dissolves the make up and dirt and easily rinses all off --it's perfect!"

I wasn't expecting it to smooth out my texture, but it did, so that's a nice additional benefit.

I have never had a reaction on any product so this was very surprising. Neck was filled with red rashes it was so weird. I had to stop. It feels good to mix it with a vit E cream. Even though my neck broke out in rashes I still used it over few months because I liked the consistency and smell when I mixed it with my vit E cream but it was not worth the breakout. Neck got dark patches after the red because of breakout.

Without a ratio to follow it's easy to find yourself using too much and developing a chemical burn over time, or using too little and not really benefiting from the product. It does blend instantly and fully, and helped brighten my skin, but not without a nasty burn after a month of use. I'll go back to using moisturizers that have vitamin C in them instead of playing mad scientist and blending my own."

FYI, for the price of this on Amazon, you can get standard shipping and TWO containers of this directly from DECIEM. One star off for this ridiculous price, Amazon.

Also, I'm too lazy to mix it together some days, so factor that into your decision to choose it over a serum. For the price it makes sense, though."

I mix it with TO resveratrol/ferulic acid and TO hyaluronic acid and it mixes very well, not grainy. My fave all time vit c powder is a more expensive and smaller size, but this compares very well and is a lot more cost affective. My only con: The Ordinary doesn’t recommend mixing with niacinamide, which I also use and love!! So I alternate between am and pm and it seems to be working. My oily, acne-prone skin is brighter and smoother!!"

I mix a half a scoop with squalane for anti aging and it has improved my skin so far. My only issue is how abrasive this is. It doesn't dissolve enough to put on your face. I now just do this every other week and just pat it onto my face. This combo would be perfect on your body tho. The Mad Hippie vitamin C would be a better alternative for the face.

It is SO EASY to add a small amount every day and night, to my moisturiser, night cream etc and reap the rewards. I swear it works just as well the Laser Treatment and I could never have believed my skin would look this great! by using a product that doesn't break the bank. It has done wonders to even out my skin tone and brighten my skin.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is intended for the face and not the body. Do not put this near your eyes!!! If this gets near your eyes, you might have to call poision control or something. I just know it will hurt super bad.

A lot of people don't know how to use vitamin-C, so I wanted to leave some helpful information as when used improperly, it can make aging worse and leave your skin much more vulnerable than without this.

If you are using this to look younger, and you don't wear sunscreen routinely, this can make you look older (if you go out in the sun). If you stay in all day and don't stand near windows, you're fine. Vitamin C makes your skin more vulnerable to UV rays. Please never put this on and spend all day in 90 degree weather. You might ""look"" ok (if you don't tend to burn) but this is so bad. It's a chemical product for a reason. It works wonders on your face when you use it right.

How I use it: I do my hyaluronic acid toner, then this power with The Ordinary Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3 mixed together (so I do 1 scoop of the powder with 4 drops of the resveratrol) after I heard about what a powerful duo this is. Please read this for more info: [Which serum would be the best to mix with L-Ascorbic Acid Powder? You may wish to explore The Ordinary Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3%. This formula combines very high concentrations of two of the most powerful and important antioxidants in skincare. Resveratrol and Ferulic Acid helps support the skin’s defense against oxidative stress caused by environmental factors that play a major role in the loss of visible skin quality over time. The benefits of topically applied resveratrol and ferulic acid are continuing and cumulative.]

Anyways, I saw people saying they mix this with their moisturizer, but please make sure you don't have any strong chemicals in your lotion or heavy fragrances as this combination can make your skin irritated. I wouldn't mix this with a lotion at all. Why? This Vitamin C is so powerful but you're diluting it when you mix it with lotion. The lotion is super heavy which won't allow this to penetrate into your skin. With skincare, you need to work your way up from in consistency and heaviness. Use this earlier on in your routine, not as the last step. Lotion should be the final seal on your skin (if you use multiple skincare products).

Vitamin C is a great product but you have to be serious when you use it or you will pay for it later or with a burn. If your skin is irritated, that doesn't mean it's burned. It's great to start using a small amount to see how your skin reacts. Give it time and your skin will thank you for this. It really does brighten my skin and I am always glowing but I've been using it for over 5 years. I tend to not use it as often during the summer because sometimes I forget to wear sunscreen."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this with distilled water per Dr. Greger's recipe in ""How Not to Age.""

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Ordinary always has great prices and even though this was a bit more expensive here on Amazon, I paid the six dollars more for the convince. The product is great, it mixes well with water-based moisturizers, it comes with a little plastic spoon so it is easy to measure and scoop out of the jar, and it goes on nicely with no irritation on my skin. Makes my skin look plump and bright. If you are into skincare and want to add more vitamin C this is a great way to go."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quite simply, the only vitamin C product I will be using for the foreseeable future. It’s a complete triumph of a product, at a shockingly affordable price.

I mix it with a creamy moisture serum after toner and essences in the morning, leave it on to cook for 15-20 mins while I do other things, then follow with more serums and my moisturizer. No weird gritty texture, no pilling or anything. It stays potent for a very long time because it hasn’t been premixed with water, which is not easy to find in a vitamin C. I love it, I reorder immediately when I’m running out.

It’s pretty powerful so I’d go slow when finding your dosage, don’t use any acids before or after in the beginning, and maybe use an eye cream beforehand to buffer your sensitive eye skin a bit. I don’t have issues with it but I’ve been using active 5ever and my skin is pretty tolerant by now, but a too-strong-C-product burn is no joke, so take ‘Dr easy."

My skin looks brighter and feels smoother. The powder dissolves easily, leaving no residue. It’s a simple yet effective addition to my skincare routine. Just be sure you are not mixing too much since vitamin C can be irritating to the skin. Highly recommend!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this powder form which is easy to mix into my skin cream and after a few weeks I'm already seeing a difference. The small lines on my chin are almost gone and my skin feels so much smoother! I have a few very stubborn brown spots and they're still there but I probably need to give it more time.

A few reviews mentioned that it makes your make up flake, and I had that happen a couple of times, but I realized it was most likely because I didn't let the powder dissolve completely into my face cream or I didn't used enough face cream. I've added a dollop of lubriderm lotion to the mix and as long as I mix everything in well I don't have any issues with flaking anymore. You'll also want to give it a few minutes before you apply your make up.

I love this powder and I'll never go back to unstable Vit C serums again! For the price I'll buy more and use this in my body lotion too!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If it didn’t work so well I would give it one less star for packaging. It should be in a shaker so I put it in a shaker bottle. I’ve been using this for over a year now and love the results. Wish I had a before picture. Initially it was for acne. After using it a month, I noticed a large sleep wrinkle had almost completely disappeared! Shake a little into your palm with your moisturizer, mix it, and apply like normal. My skin loves it but it’s not for sensitive skin."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have been using about one month and so far so good! Easy to mix, dissolves well, long lasting quantity. No complaints!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are lots of expensive C serums on the market. L ascorbic acid breaks down once in the serums so the shelf life is brief. I believe this routine is better: powder face with this dry ingredient, activate by wetting face, follow up by using your favorite face cream. A small jar of Ordinary L-ascorbic acid lasts for months."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really works to diminish dark spots. I mix
It in the palm of my hand with a water based moisturizer. Mixes quickly and it never turns yellow as other vitamin C products do when they degrade with light. It’s the best. Besides, you control the strength."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I would have given it 5 stars all the way except, you don’t swallow it, it’s a topical so, therefore it has no flavor. 🤣🤣

I mix it with the ordinary natural Moisturizing factor + HA and my skin tone is flawless!! It also controls oil.

The above photos have no makeup, and no filter. I’m 51 yrs old. My skin did not look this radiant before!!

Only thing is, it’s cheaper at Ulta. About half the cost. I prefer the convenience of Amazon, so I pay the difference."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been diving into skincare for the past couple of years. I stumbled on the importance of vitamin C and begin testing several products, I later learned the shelf life in most vitamin C serums is 4-6 weeks (meaning most serums are expired or ineffective within a few weeks, you can tell when serums turns brown or dark orange). I found The Ordinary brand and this powder formula. The shelf life is much longer and you can apply a small amount into your moisturizer as needed. I would highly recommend this product to those looking for a cost effective vitamin C product. The only downside is each time you want to use the product you have to create a small cocktail of your moisturizer and the vitamin C powder."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve used this brand on and off for 2 years and love it! Personally I prefer powder versions of vitamin C vs serum because I can control the amount and you don’t have to worry about it expiring. With the ordinary’s version you get A LOT of product. I’ve used the powered vitamin C by Philosophy which is around $60 and you get way less. This is just as effective.

Final note: Vitamin C typically makes people break out if they’re prone to that. I get small whiteheads when I first use it but eventually my skin acclimates. I just wouldn’t judge this product specifically if that happens to you—it may happen with any vitamin C."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an interesting experience for me. The powder should be added to any cream and applied to the face, hands, anywhere. The quantity is enough for a long time. There is no smell. It's just a white powder and the cream usually becomes liquid on contact with it."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the ascorbic acid powder so i can finally have a vitamin C serum with the perfect strength, texture, freshness because i mix it in my palm so easily, just as I'm about to use it. It doesn't activate until it's mixed into a liquid suspension so it stays fresh & never oxidizes or breaks down like most vit. C serums do. And at such an economical price too. Also, it's blended easily into all the mediums I've added it to as it's a very fine powder. Just love it. I've added it to my Cerave pm moisurizer, a few of my other Ordinary and Good Molecule serums."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this to make a DIY vitamin C serum and there is waaaaaay more than enough (despite the container being small) for MULTIPLE uses.

Lasts much longer than the 1 ounce size of Vitamin C serum/cream (which I also love, but I must buy 4 at a time when it’s available because 1ounce doesn’t go very far). I’m 65 and my 3 daughters are irritated with me because they say I have no wrinkles, no dark spots, and small pores. Thank you, “The Ordinary”!"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Guys...I've tried 2 other 20% vitamin C products- and sure they were fine but turned yellow 1-2 weeks into use and I couldn't really say for sure if they made my skin look any different. But this! Day 1 My skin was glowing when I woke up! Throw on a little moisturizer and powder and you've got that dewy, lit-from-within look for pennies on the dollar. The powder is a little weird and fiddly to mix with whatever other moisturizer you use but totally worth the results. Definitely recommend."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is by far one of the best ascorbic acids that I have used. I mix it with shea butter as the last step in nightly routine. I have some dark spots and discoloration due to acne scars. The spots and discoloring have faded in 3 days. Some are even completely gone. A little does go a long way. I did experience an intense tingling sensation. I chose to mix with shea butter because I felt mixing with another acid or chemically based product would result in skin irritation. Great product I would buy this again.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this directly from The Ordinary Store a while back and I looked up how to use it, but bc of all the hate by major social influencers for it, I never bothered to use it. I just recently decided to work through the jar to make room for new stuff....I lather my body and face w some nice aloe vera, then mix this (i don't measure but it's about 1/4 tsp) w a retinol lotion and slather it all over my body and face...this stuff works! especially w aloe vera, I use the Korean stuff, it seems to help it penetrate. My hyper pigmentation on my face is much lighter...and maybe this is too much info, but my nipple color is even lighter! LOL...however I used a bit too much on my face and it turned orangey temporarily for a couple of days...I looked tanned. The texture all over my body seems so much smoother too. I would definitely repurchase. I'm just sad it took me so long to start using this stuff. It dissolves so easily bc it's finely milled. If you find it too difficult to use on your face for whatever reason, use it on your body...just don't over do it or you may end up orange."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am using this with The Ordinary's hyaluronic acid serum. I take out about 1/4 of the provided scoop into the palm of my hand and then drop some the hyaluronic serum there as well and use my finger to mix it in well and then apply to my face. The hyaluronic serum dries fast so I do move fast or add more before applying to my face. It has not turned my face orange and so far the powder has maintained it's white color. I keep it tightly closed in a drawer. So far, I've had no irritation and do feel brightening and a protective, anti aging benefit from doing it this way. All other vitamin C serums have turned orange way to fast and are also very expensive. I would recommend."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Item arrived timely and well packaged. In approximately 2 weeks of nightly use, I’m finding brighter, smoother complexion, and I feel comfortable wearing only a tinted moisturizer in lieu of foundation or any concealer. I’ve not experienced any yellow or orange staining as some may have experienced. Per The Ordinary’s website, I use a partial scoop, and mix mine in palm of hand with with Marine Hyaluronics. There is a bit of a gritty texture and tackiness to my face that results after application, which I’m fond of, however, with the great results I’ve had, I’m willing to overlook that aspect."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: I actually think the vitabrid c-12 power works much better than this one. Im back to using vitabrid & i just get a few when its on sale for $30. But if thats not in your budget this one is does the job.

I got the vitabrid-c12 power from ipsy & was amazed by how fast it makes acne scars disappear. But at $60 per tiny bottle i was hesitant to buy it myself. Then i found the ordinary's version. You get sooo much product & the powder formula lets you get all the benefits from your vit c ( rather than serum where the molecule denatures and stops working). My acne scars begin fading within a week of a bump healing! Only thing is that it will stain white fabric when it oxidizes (i noticed the inside of my masks look like i wore foundation) but just wash your hands after applying instead of like rubing them off on your towel"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this vitamin c powder from The Ordinary and the price point is good. Beats paying $40 for a much smaller amount from philosophy. The product desolves almost instantly and there is no irritation as far as I can tell. The product is versatile and can be mixed in with almost any skincare product. Add it to your creams, Serums, mask and microcurrent/ galvanic gels. It's just like adding a booster to your skincare routine."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product is the best!! It is the most potent form of vitamin c. It works amazing a little goes along way. My skin is on the sensitive side there is a little burning/tingling ,but Doesn’t stay and no redness or breakouts occur. Would recommend a test run on hand before face. My crows feet completely vanished, and my skins is tighter and more even intone. I us a very small amount and mix it with a few drops of Resvertrol 3% and B oil and rub on to my whole face. It tells you to not mix with Niacinamide or EUK 134. Hope this helps"

I was a bit hesitant because of the reviews about the orange tint and burning sensations on their website, but I haven't experienced any problems as of yet. I use a quarter of the little spoon mixed into a few drops of their hyaluronic acid. So far so good.

Update: Have been using this product faithfully for a while now. Still no problems with the orange tint and my skin feels great. Although that can be attributed to my overall face care regimen. But this is a part of it so I will keep using it."

I belong to Natural Kaos skin care app and The Ordinary Vitamin C powder was highly recommended. I wash my face and apply The Ordinary - Amino Acids + B5 A Concentrated Hydration Support Formula to my face and let it absorb for about 5mins. I mix the Vitamin C powder (just a 1/4 of the little scoop that comes with it) with THE ORDINARY Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% Antioxidant in the palm of my hand and press it into my face,neck and décolleté. I noticed a big difference after the first time I used it. The vitamin C is always fresh and I know it does it’s job for skin.
I love all The Ordinary products . If you look them up on line you can find the regime for your skincare concerns. The website also tells you what you can and cannot mix together. Very reasonably price and awesome product."

I mix a tiny spoonful with aplha arbutin and apply after hyaluronic acid and before The Inkey List tranexamic acid - that amount goes over my face, decolletage, and forearms. The idea is to target sun damage and it works. I've seen negative reviews that it's grainy but I just add enough AA to counteract that and don't apply til it's a smooth consistency in my hands. Also I use this after any session in the pool - vitamin C is like the chemical opposite of chlorine and in my experience (as a swim teacher) nothing else neutralizes the smell and effects."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is very great that opens skin tone, cleanses it and keeps it fresh,
but it needs precision in use because the spoon attached to it is very large, which may cause burns or irritations to people with little experience in how to use.

I use less than a quarter of the outstanding with five drops of halornic acid or hydrating moisturizer before bedtime because vitamin C dissolves in them quickly"
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product. My skin is glowing and looks fresh. Did tingle a little when I put it on my face but I was excepting that. Will be ordering this product again.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder, Vitamin C Treatment for Anti-Aging, 0.7 Ounce",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So just be aware that this is pure L- Ascorbic Acid (the best form of VIt C for skin) so if your skin is not used to this active ingredient you may need to build up to it as not to cause irritation. I have built up resilience over many years of 20% Vit C regular use, and I found this one stings a little at first. So as not to irritate my skin, will use every other night. (and use an 8% during the day). This powder can be added to any serum and gives a slippery and hydrating feel to the skin. There is no scent and because it is in powder form, it will not break down like other serums. I would definitely repurchase."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion, Advanced Retinoid Alternative for Anti-Aging and Skin Texture Improvement, 1 Fl Oz",,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was a little suspicious of this product when it arrived as it didn't come in the original packaging and arrived wrapped in bubble wrap inside an envelope. It also had stickers covering the original bottle. However the formulas appeared to be very similar to a bottle I already had open so I gave it a go. I use this product to treat acne which had worked well for 2 years but this bottle made my skin worse. I broke out in the worst acne I have had for years so I'm not sure if this is a genuine product and I have stopped using it. I bought another bottle from my usual site and my acne has now cleared up again. I would be interested to hear what the sellers explanation is for there not being original packaging as it seems the same has happened to other buyers. I definitely do not recommend buying this product from this seller.

It sinks in but it doesn't dry out immediately. It's a milky emulsion that gently lingers ever so slightly so I never feel dry. I still use my moisturizer on top but I don't have to use as much so I'm also saving money. My skin feels supple in the morning too. I'm really looking forward to the results at the end of my bottle.

Granactive Retinoid 2% emulsion🤎
@skincareobsessed____

Soo I’ve been using this Retinoid for about a month, and I’ve been using this during my alternate nights of using tretinoin. My upgraded dosage does sensitize my skin a bit so I do need a couple of nights off. I do use the Retinoid 3-4x a week). The Granactive Retinoid has a strength of 2 percent but, I don’t really have trouble with getting use to the strength since I’m an regular user of vitamin A. The texture is very lovely and has a milky consistency which I find hydrating to the skin in my opinion.

As in for my skin, it is making me purge. So I knew this was bound to happen and I’m not mad at it(Purge for the better skin🤗). I started purging around the 2nd week of using it and I’m still purging as of now. I did notice the appearance of my other dark spots fading a less slowly than usual, so that’s a plus. And I have a lot of product left over so it’s gonna last me a while.

I definitely recommend this Retinoid to beginners who wanna start using Vitamin A derivatives. Due to the non irritating ingredients, Deciem claims It’s very mild and its non irritating. As a person with sensitive skin I totally urge people with sensitive skin to use it(but then again everyone’s skin is different)."

I clarify that the marks are not very deep or marked, I don't know if it works the same way for someone with a more severe problem.

It's not that I expected every single imperfection to disappear overnight...but what compelled me to write this is: just after 72 hours of twice daily use...it has made my skin SUPER blotchy (which it wasn't before), makes my face look and feel extremely greasy (I have normal skin with dry areas, my skin is never oily), and it's made all of my imperfections stand out! I feel the few little lines that drive me nuts actually look WORSE. My 11s look deeper and so do my marionette lines. I look terrible after using this for just a few days! I've also noticed little bumps forming all over my face, in my tear troughs, along near the jawline on either side, and on my forehead. I would advise those of you wanting to try this: do so ONLY if you are at a very advanced age and moisture has naturally been depleted from your skin, or if your face is normally the Sahara desert no matter what age.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Matrixyl 10% + HA, Anti-Aging Serum for Fine Lines and Wrinkles, 1 Fl Oz",,3.0 out of 5 stars,Still neutral on the subject. Almost gone. Bought it and se simultaneously with the Buffet. Skin is less dry not not really seen much change. Used twice a day. Had no irritation from either product. The Ordinary has many products and may move on. This mature skin needs more help that this.

With continuous use after a few weeks my skin became very red and sensitive and I had to stop using it. I love active ingredient list and value for money, but I think I am allergic to phenoxyethanol even it is in a very low concentration in this serum. I will use it a few times a week just to not waste it, but sadly will not buy it again."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Matrixyl 10% + HA, Anti-Aging Serum for Fine Lines and Wrinkles, 1 Fl Oz",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved this serum as soon as I started using it. I swear I saw a difference in the first couple of days, especially on my lip lines. Unfortunately though, I then started to get tingling around my mouth, which eventually resulted in 'chapped' lips. I let them heal then went back to using the serum less often, eventually down to once a week but the same thing kept happening. I eventually gave up with this product and tried the 'buffet' serum instead (less matrixyl) but I still get tingly lips a couple of days after using it. I am now completely avoiding my mouth area (my main area of concern) and only use 'buffet' a couple of times a week but can still feel my lips tingling! I do think Matrixyl works and is definitely worth a try but just be aware in case you are also sensitive to the product ."

Deciem produces active ingredients and holy cow they are active indeed. i m using this one among 4 other substances and my skin has gone from dull to glow and healthy within the forst 2 weeks. I know everyone has a different sensitivity level and i wnat to point out this is how my skin reacted . I am almost 50 and stiull have breakouts from time to time. that ended with a comninabtion of the Viatmin C30 at night and this priduct , Buffet, and nicainamin during the day. Sunscreen is a logic step if you make the effort to enteretain such treatments. And as i dont like. to say the word cheap , these are . I spend now 100 $ every 8-10 weeks , and have a battert of active helpers. I wished they exosted years agoi when i was willing to spend 300 bucks for a high end swiss prodct that clocged my pores royaly.
i recommend to try what works for you and then stick with it for some time . i belive they have a very good range but proceed with caution oif you have super-senstiv skin , these are ACTIVE ingrediens indeed."

I absolutely saw benefits from the very first use, but of course it only got better over time. I didn’t order it from Amazon, as I got it straight from The Ordinary, but figured it didn’t hurt to come here & leave an honest review anyway. I’m turning 40 in a couple weeks & began noticing wrinkles appearing over the past year, specifically between my eyebrows & laugh lines. The line between my eyebrows is pretty much GONE, I can just see a faintly discolored line where the wrinkle was. As far as the laugh lines, they’re less noticeable but more difficult to get rid of since I try to laugh everyday 😏.

This is a must buy if you’re seeing wrinkles that you want to banish before they get worse. I can’t speak for anyone who’s had wrinkles for a while or have deep folds, but I do think this would help that also."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% in Squalane, Gentle Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first time buying a cosmetic with retinol, and according to my information, some of the things you might notice after use were irritation and peeling. Something normal.

After having used it for a month progressively, I haven't noticed anything at all. Basically it's an oil. It's not worth it. It doesn't have the effect you'd expect from a product with retinol.

I waited to write this review after trying another serum. And in this case, with two applications separated by a week, the skin has started to flake in some areas.

So I confirm my suspicions. I will not buy this product again. And I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% in Squalane, Gentle Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Applied this once and l ended up with a very itchy face some stinging and a poor night of sleep. I have tried tretinoin (0.025) in the past and never had that problem. I had to stop using tretinoin because after a few weeks of use it caused rashes on my cheeks; l have mild rosacea. I thought that maybe l should have started with retinol first and decided to give this a go, but the weird stingy, itchy reaction was enough for me. Never again. Mild strength tretinoin and retinol are apparently quite beneficial to rosacea sufferers, but after these experiences l would recommend forking out the money and seeing a dermatologist first. If you have sensitive skin or issues with inflammatory skin problems proceed with caution. I reckon if l had used the ordinary product a second night then l might have ended up with a rash."

At first I thought this was just signs of purging but by week 5 now it is only getting worse and I have decided to stop using the product.

Remember squaline is an oil. If you need oil free products for every other reason remember this is the same for squaline. I regret using this as I have a permanent spot scar on my nose which I did not burst or touch and it then scarred. I stoped using this in November and I still have this scar.

This oil was not the same color as the previous 2 bottles. It has a bad odor and it is not working. It leaves my face feeling oily. I have read on other reviews of similar situations but I thought maybe they were just complainers. Nope! I absolutely loved my first two bottles but this 3rd bottle was a waste of money. I lowered it from my original 5 star review to 3 stars.

I’ve been using this product every night before bed for about 3 weeks. It is oily going on, which made me nervous at first. With other oil based products I usually get breakouts. This did not cause a breakout. It seems to soak in within about a half hour.

Result: I have been very happy with the results. I was getting pretty significant wrinkles around me eyes. They seemed to have really gotten deeper in the past few months. That is why I decided to try this. I wish I had done before and after pictures. Those deep wrinkles are much softer. They are not gone but soft enough that I don’t feel self conscious about them.

Advice: do a before and after picture."

The product goes on nicely. The moisturising effect of squalane balances out the drying effect of retinol so I had no problems with dryness or redness. I use jojoba oil as my moisturiser so used this on top as normal, and also an SPF during the day.

I definitely noticed my skin looked clearer and brighter after a few weeks of use, however I felt my skin could tolerate a bit more so I have recently started using the 0.5 version, which is incredible!"

However, over time, I've observed that my skin has become noticeably more radiant and firmer.

For context, I’m 30 and have some age appropriate wrinkles on my forehead and between my eyebrows, even without frowning. This retinol has made them completely go away with just a few uses! I’m not super consistent with my skincare (I get laaazy at night) but applying this every other day for a few weeks made a huge difference.
The mix is pretty light (not oily at all) and applies easily! You need very little to cover your whole face so it lasts a while. I haven’t noticed any strong scent when applying."

Not crazy but i have been waking up with super smooth clean. (Also, to be transparent, I did just start a whole new skincare routine). This retinol I use at night after my cleanse and moisturiser.

I added the cerave SA cleaner, and the Paula’s Choice, Verse Dew point moisturiser in the morning. At night I do my regular cleaner, retinol, and my moisturiser :) that way you can see what else I am adding. I can’t 100% attribute my clearer skin to this but I can attribute my smooth AM “I woke up like this” to the retinol."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% in Squalane, Gentle Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"really dislike this product. It gave me way more acne than i started with. What I mean is, before I used this, I had 1 or 2 pimples. After using it for 6 weeks, I got rather severe acne. Breaks outs everywhere. Not a purge, but a full on breakout. I got acne on areas of my face that I never got acne before. It was a nightmare. I am now using Curology, and that seems to be taking my newly severe acne down a notch.

I am uncertain about this product. I have been using it for almost 3 weeks now. My pores might look a little smaller, but other than that I am not too sure if it is working. I use it every other night. If i use it every night, I break out more. Every other night doesn't make me break out more than usual, but i still have acne in my troubled areas. I don't have any redness or irritation though. If there are any great changes in the future, I'll come back and edit my review"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% in Squalane, Gentle Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first anti age product I buy for myself (I'm 26). I was super confused about retinol, retinoids, hyaluronic acid etc. and was doing my own research on pros, cons and what to start with. Then I came across someone's review on Amazon for this precise product, who also seemed to have started with this serum and seemed very satisfied, so I gave it a go.
I had no redness nor peeling as the label warns you might experience. I use 5 drops in the evening before going to bed on my face (avoiding the soft skin under the eyes) and neck. Of course it's a little oily (duh it's a serum), but by the morning it's all been absorbed.
Ok: effects. My skin feels amazing. Soft, dewy, clear... It looks *great*. And the two fine lines I had on my forehead which I was obsessing over have started to look much more fine and kind of 'blended in my forehead' (ok that sounds weird, but their appearance has much improved - aka I can't notice them as much as before). There's no getting rid of wrinkles you already have, that much I know, but this product is great for starting the lifelong battle with age, making you feel like 'yep I'm an adult now and dealing with it', and it works really really well at making my complexion look healthy, moist and firm.
There's no good age to start using antiage products, but there definitely is in my experience a good product to start with :)"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% in Squalane, Gentle Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am 26 and this is my first Retinol product, it has 0.2% concentration, one of the lowest available. It is based in Squalane, which is a light non-comedogenic oil that prevents oxidation (retinol losing its effectiveness). Additionally it comes in a dark bottle which protects it from light.

I use it once a week on completely dry skin after cleansing (using it on wet could cause irritation) and only at night, because it makes skin more sensitive to UV lights and is therefore not recommended in the mornings. I usually wait 5-7 mins before applying a moisturiser to let it absorb fully. I have noticed my skin feels drier and tighter (normal side effects). I will continue to use it and slowly increase the frequency for my skin to get used to it. So far I am satisfied with the product.

UPDATE 28/11
I have now been using this for well over 6 months and whilst my skin was okay to start with, I have noticed some changes. My complexion is more dewy and I feel more comfortable without makeup. I have increased the frequency and I am now using this product 4-5 times a week. There was some redness at the beginning and my cheeks peeled slightly but apparently this is to be expected whilst the skin gets adjusted. I use about 1/3 of the dropper with each application and so far I have used about 3/4 of the bottle. Overall I am happy with this product and would recommend it."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% in Squalane, Gentle Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for some KP bumps on the back of my arms. I've been using it for about a month now, every night (bar the odd night where I forget). I also apply it to my face. On my arms, I can see a slow change, although this is probably not the only product to use for KP. As for my face, I've seen a change, again, not as fast as some of the other reviewers here have. It hasn't helped by acne and spots completely, but it has definitely changed the quality of my skin; it's more radiant and noticeably smoother. I have sensitive skin and yet apply this every night, so maybe I will consider increasing the strength for my next bottle."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% in Squalane, Gentle Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This product was recommended to me by a friend. He advised me to start with a low strength and build up if I needed to, which is why I opted for 0.2%. The product is easy to apply and after one week of use I have noticed an improvement, especially on a stubborn patch of eczema that umpteen other products have failed to help. It acts like a peel so lots of little blemishes and blockages that have been under my skin for ages are now beginning to clear. I would definitely recommend this product 😊"

I am new to The Ordinary as I was skeptical first of it but now it's my primary cosmetic. I used 30 day AM&PM different treatment-combinations of buffet+copper, H. acid +B5, Caffeine, retinol 0,2% and rose hip oil and could see the difference on my skin (reduction of redness & wrinkles, spots, black heads). Caffeine is the only product which I think didn’t do any difference. Skin adapted to the products in within a week."

Its a dripper with a light oil texture and I dont wear make up these days so wouldnt be able to tell you how good it is as a base but it absorbs beautifully.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% in Squalane, Gentle Retinol Serum for the Face That Is Anti-Aging and Skin Smoothing, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So let me start the review off by saying I love this product. I bought this one as my introduction to retinol after a long research. Since I expected some irritation that comes with retinol products I started with a low percentage like this. Happy to report I didn't have any irritation whatsoever (my skin did go through the purging part of it all, but that's to be expected with first time retinol use). I think irritation didn't occur because of squalane which has certain anti-inflammatory properties. All in all, I'm very happy with this product.
Seller has been extremely professional and polite and I definitely recommend buying from them."

Does a good job of moisturising. Can’t say I’ve noticed a difference in my skin though, I wouldn’t buy it again. Recently discovered how these natural oils can go rancid pretty quickly (as soon as six months) and I have very sensitive acne prone skin so I’m phasing this out, will still use as a body/hair oil though. I really recommend the squalane oil as it’s got more fatty acids that will help restore damaged skin moisture barriers, doesn’t go rancid and has more antioxidants properties from what I’ve read."

For a complete novice to acid peels..""Use once daily and ideally in the pm""...is not sufficient. Nothing about how to apply? how long to leave it on for? does it need a neutralizer?... Dangerous to Google generically for this type of thing when it's your face! Emailed the company for instructions but no response so it's just sat there. Better safe than sorry.

Again, it wasnt immediate it slowly crept in and got worse and worse.
It has taken me a week of skipping this and using aveeno calm and restore lotion and my skin is finally starting to get back to normal.
Guess if your skin is sensitive enough, mandelic is also too harsh."

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Mandelic Acid 10% + HA, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Clarity and Hydration, 1 Fl Oz",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"MAY 2020: I am disappointed in this product a bit. I've used acids in the past with great results. I bought this with the intention to add it to my night routine for smoothing and resurfacing texture in my skin. But I find the the consistency to not layer well with my other serums. This has an oil like feeling that causes my hyaluronic acid serum (also from The Ordinary) to roll really badly. I have to almost pat this in completely to even make it work which takes up a ton of time. I usually like to feel a bit of a tingle when applying acids, but with this I feel nothing at all. I think Id have better luck with the lactic acid serum from The Ordinary for night time. I also experienced a breakout after the second night of using this product. I cannot say if it was the product that caused it or my own hormones. All in all I give this product a 3 star rating because I haven't used it long enough to feel or see a difference, but so far am not impressed with its texture.

*UPDATE* July 2020
This stuff is way better than I originally thought, it just needs time to work! My overall texture and tone has much improved. I pair it exclusively with Rosehip seed oil. I included a photo with no makeup"

I then ordered Sephora’s. After trying Sephora’s product, I feelt both were the same product , identical. I have not peeled or felt any peeling sensation with any of them. I feel the Amazon product is genuine. I am keeping both products to to see how it goes and hoping the dark spots improve."

I'm hoping that maybe I just used a little too much and next time it won't be as greasy, but I will be happy to review again later and let you all know how it goes! I'm really hoping it works as well as the reviews say and that I can get over the greasiness.

Update:
I have been using this product for about 5 weeks now and I have not noticed any change in the appearance or texture of my skin. I have acne and hyperpigmentation/melasma. The product is oily and feels greasy, even after rubbing it in. I would not buy this again."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Mandelic Acid 10% + HA, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Clarity and Hydration, 1 Fl Oz",,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This 10% Mandelic is not irritating on my sensitive skin, but the formula seems to contain a high % of glycerine (?) or an ingredient that leaves a wet greasy look on the face that doesn't dry or absorb. It sits on my skin and smears on contact, long after it's been applied. Perhaps in a dry environment it works out better?? I was excited to find it at a price much lower than another brand, but dislike the formula at any price. I did a patch test with this compared to 5% TCA peel and it turned out that I can tolerate this but not the TCA. I have extremely sensitive however I'll try another brand and discard this."

I’d read a lot about mandelic acid for acne improvement, pore refinement, and brightening skin tone so I was very excited to try this (I have large pores and hyperpigmentation from acne). This was... alright. I haven’t noticed any lightening of my scars or improvement in my skin texture. It helps a little with active acne, and it’s not irritating to my sensitive skin, but it’s nothing to write home about and I have five or six other products that I like much better for blemishes. The price was very reasonable, so it was worth trying, but I wouldn’t purchase this item again."

This product however doesn't seem to work very well at all. It leaves a oily layer on your skin and didn't seem to help keep my acne away or make them go away like other products. In fact, I am pretty sure it's drying my face out and making it worse. I would not recommend this product to anyone, maybe it just didn't work for me but you know how it goes.

The contents are a bit oily and you need to be careful about the pipette when you pull it out because it drips and you lose the contents. I put it on pose all night, as I had read, but I sincerely advise against it because in the morning I was reddened. Better leave it on for 40 minutes and remove it. The product seems to work, used consistently, helps to improve the skin. I do it once a week, my skin becomes softer and smoother, although personally I have tried even better peels, but this is also good.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Mandelic Acid 10% + HA, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Clarity and Hydration, 1 Fl Oz",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Ordinary’s Mandelic acid formula seemed a bit oily/slick at first, but it still works pretty well. I wouldn’t use it for daily use, but it works well for 2-4 times a week (maybe every other day). It doesn’t cause lots of visible peeling, which is good for me, but does cause a very slight tingly burn so you know it is working.

I think the 5% Lactic Acid formula with HA is slightly better in general, and makes the skin nice and soft, and less dry. But, this one is pretty good too. Be careful if using more than one irritating/acid based product at a time. (If you use one on a given day, don’t use the other.)"

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Mandelic Acid 10% + HA, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Clarity and Hydration, 1 Fl Oz",,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Mandelic acid is the most delicate of all acids that perform an exfoliating function. The brand says it can also be used daily as it is not photosensitizing. Actually, although I have a mixed/oily skin, after two days I had very dry areas and the sebum in the T zone had increased. I recommend using it max once a week and not in combination with other exfoliating products. Used sparingly (one evening a week in my case) is really an effective product.

I never thought I had sensitive skin until a product with salicylic acid broke me really badly a month before my wedding. Curse you, salicylic acid, you are not for me. But this product is - mandelic acid. I can't remember how I heard about it, but what really got me interested was the fact that's is recommended for Skin of Colour, like mine :D
FIRST USE: I applied four drops on my face (forehead, cheeks, nose/chin) after cleansing (oil and foam), then allowed it to sink in before continuing with the rest of my routine (toner, serum, moisturiser). Honestly, it takes a little while to sink in your skin, don't use too much, you'll be waiting a LONG time.
The next morning I was washing my face and I was like, omg, my cheeks are baby soft. So soft, my skin was legit renewed, it felt like a miracle was happening. Basically, any sort of decongestion was dissolved and I was left with smooth skin. Yes, it works , if you need an acid that won't irritate your skin, this may be the one for you."
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Mandelic Acid 10% + HA, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Clarity and Hydration, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After doing some research and with thee suggestion from others I decided to add a chemical exfoliator to my skin care routine. This was one of my options and I liked how easy and clear it is to see what the product is made from as I am very new to this whole ordeal. After adjusting my skin to it, and slowly adding it to my routine I have to say that I am seeing incredibly clearer skin on my face in just 2 months. There was about a 3 week period of breakouts as the product worked to clear out what was already in my skin, but after the initial worsening things have gotten better and now my skin is very clear and smooth. I am so impressed that I decided to see if it would help to clear my shoulders as well. It has only been a few weeks but so far so good! I will certainly continue to use this in the future, and am considering getting it for my brother as well."

I had to go online to figure out what to do (how much to use, when to use, how often, etc). But a little bit of Googling solved that.

Honestly, after just a few days I started seeing my skin gradually clear up and dark spots lighten. I have some problem areas on my chin with lots of small bumps and scars and on my cheeks. I've been using this for about 3 or 4 weeks now and I've only had one PMS zit and it went away super fast. Like 24 hrs fast. And the dark spots are getting lighter and lighter.

Plus, just a few drops go a long way. This stuff is seriously worth it. Love it!"

And I'm just now writing a review. I don't have problems with my skin at all. I used this for exfoliation. Over the years I noticed that if I were to have a slight reaction to something (a new lotion or oil) this will clear me up by the next morning. I don't use it as regularly as I tell myself too but I can't not have it in my skin care arsenal.
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Mandelic Acid 10% + HA, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Clarity and Hydration, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,In 1 week I saw a huge difference my dark spots were lighter and some gone completely.

From the very first use, it just begins shedding the old dull skin on your face. I was surprised to see my cystic acne on my chin drying out over night, and the skin peeling off any beginning scars around it - this stuff is amazing! I am a darker skin tone, and worry about products bleaching my skin, so far, I'm not seeing this to be an issue, it does exactly what it says - a gentler peel for a more even skin tone, and great for dark skin tones. This is a great AHA to add to any beauty regimen, just follow the instructions to avoid over sensitivity to the skin, and SPF is a must in the daytime! Definitely a part of my skincare regimen from now on!"

Did find it much cheaper elsewhere after I ordered on here but I will no longer use any other brand of similar skin products. This works great for KP (the dry bumps on the back of your arms) and for acne. I mix it with ""rough and bumpy skin"" lotion and massage it in and it makes a drastic difference overnight. Even without the added lotion. My toddler also occasionally gets little red bumps on her face/arms and putting this on every night clears them up in as little as 2 days. I plan to buy pretty much the whole line."

I’m oily face. Originally there were 5-6 dark acne scars. They are much faded in the forth day which is today.

My steps:
1. wash face with cleanser

2. wash with scrub to thin the horny layer(uppermost of skin)

3. Slightly wipe out water spots on skin with towel, but leave your skin with moist

4. Get 3-4 drops of this product on left hand, use 1 or 2 fingers on right hand to dip and apply on your face, 3-4 drops are enough to cover whole face

5. Basic steps you usually do, Toner, serum, then cream(or lotion)"

I’ve had lichen simplex simplex since I was a child. The skin in that area had always been dark, scaly and dry. I could never ever not feel embarrassed by the way it looked as it’s much darker than the rest of my hand. I’ve only been using this product for about two weeks now faithfully every night before bed on the darker area and it’s already significantly improved on both of my hands.

The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Mandelic Acid 10% + HA, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Clarity and Hydration, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product is amazing...I have been using it since Oct. 2019. I had severe hyperpigmantation from years of acne scars that would not fade. I used this product every night before I go to sleep and I wear sunscreen (I use Black Girl Sunscreen) everyday. My skin would peel gently peel about every 3 days. I have had amazing results. I have clear skin for the first time in about ten years. I would recommend this product to dark skin women especially to those who have sensitive skin. I still have a little product left...so the value for money is amazing
The Ordinary,"The Ordinary Mandelic Acid 10% + HA, Gentle Exfoliating Serum for Clarity and Hydration, 1 Fl Oz",,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Incredible for my dry combo skin. Huge difference in one month and still going. mostly just reduced whitehead that would appear every morning. HOWEVER, it must be combined with a moistureizer, while humectant it doesnt stand on its own for a moisturizer having mixed with hyaluronic acid(not a big issue as its not its intended purpose)

ALSO last thing

the price is a bit pricey for its size, or I am simply unsure of how much I should be using every night. I find 3-4 drops sufficient, but uncertain exactly. ymmv. Yes it is new which is understandable. overall great for dry skin"

Ironic, since mandelic acid is essentially for sensitive skin types.
Nevertheless, it didn't cause a reaction when I patch tested it on my forearm overnight. I have the most sensitive skin in the world, products made for sensitive skin generally cause me chemical burns or a rash."

I don’t have sensitive skin but I feel like this would not be harsh on any skin type. I got this to replace my face scrub, wanted to get into chemical peels.

At first this product dried out my skin and would peel in certain areas but I didn’t mind it because it was working I was supplementing my skin with moisture, as you should.

A tip to everyone new to the product: give it a few days before your pores stop looking dilated. The product makes them look expanded because it's clearing them out from the exfoliation."
