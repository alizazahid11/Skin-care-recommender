The Ordinary,Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner,$13.00,"I was finally able to get my hands on this product. Each time I went looking for it, it was sold out. I now know why! After 1-2 uses, it removed so much dead skin you wouldn't believe it. I have become a bit of a skin care freak once I got in my late twenties. Unfortunately, I started getting sun damage and dark spots. A lot of this has already been reversed thanks to retinol, kojic acid, niacinamide, hydroquinone and face steaming. (All under the care of a licensed dermatologist of course.) But if you're looking for something to even out your skin tone and texture, as well as get rid of dead skin, this is the product for you. I am happy to say I have found another product to add to my skin care routine.",5

The Ordinary,The Acne Set 2.0: 3-Step Regimen,$15.80,"This is the first skincare regimen that has somehow cleared my cystic acne in a month. For reference, I have oily/acne prone skin. The moisturizer isn't super hydrating but it is also winter as I write this. I use a korean skincare toner, a cosrx peptide serum, and a facial mist as well with this set. Overall though, this has conquered the acne I've suffered with for years (18-26 y/o). Now I just need to attack the acne scars! At this price, it is definitely worth a try.",3
The Ordinary,The Acne Set 2.0: 3-Step Regimen,$15.80,"Love how easy and straightforward this kit is. Although, if you have dry skin like me during the winter time I would recommend a different face wash than this one. The face wash in this one is similar to panoxyl and I only used this one every other day.",5

The Ordinary,The Acne Set 2.0: 3-Step Regimen,$15.80,I would totally recommend this product. With that being said ive only been using it for 2 days and have some pointers for someone looking to use it. I wash my face 2 times a day and have sensitivish skin. Normally as long as i buy products made for sensitive skin i have no issues. The face wash seems to be great as well as the moisturizer for daily use. The moisturizer is different from others ive used it leaves my face feeling a little tight once it dries which im liking. I think it could be a little more moisturing but it isnt leaving any irritation or anything. The syrum however is pretty harsh because its drying which does help clear the acne. Is says to use it once a day starting out which i think is where you go wrong when you have sensative skin. I can feel that it is a bit irritating but once used i did notice my acne clearing. I try to listen to my body so the only recommendation i can give is to use the facewash and moisturizer daily and the syrum once or twice a week max and when you so use it put it on then once dried apply the moisturizer over top. Do not use it everyday it will dry your skin. Definitely helping sooo much with my acne though. Hope i was help to someone. Also cant beat the price.,5
The Ordinary,The Acne Set 2.0: 3-Step Regimen,$15.80,I get really bad acne breakouts on my jawline area and dry skin. I saw a difference in my skin after using this for a week. It really controls my acne and keeps my skin hydrated. Will definitely be purchasing this again.,1

I included pictures so you can see, the first picture was taken on July 1 and you can see a pretty decent bald spot and widened hair line. The second picture was taken on October 24, so just shy of 4 months, and the balding has completely stopped, along with a much healthier hair line. I see tons of baby hairs growing in still! I will also add that I have incorporated a lot more protein into my diet, which I think is helping with hair growth, too, but this serum is incredible! I just bought my second bottle. You definitely have to be consistent with it and it will not happen overnight, but it's worth the little bit of effort for healthier hair :)",5

The Ordinary,Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,$15.00 - $22.80,"First, understand healthy scalp hair takes 2-3 months to grow an inch. Longer if that hair is fine or follicle is aging. There is no quick results with what this product is - a peptide serum. Set realistic expectations. I'm mid late 30s, starting to see more quite a bit new white hairs, and possibly mild thinning on my cowlick and sides of the widow peak. I have a lot of almost black, thin, fine hair that doesn't hold a curl. I mostly wanted to see if this would help support ponytail breakage hairs growing back, and test if I do have thinning. I use this serum at night down my part, front hair line, 2 lines into the sides of my head and the bottom where I have a lot of high ponytail breakage. After using this product for about 4 months, I could tell a darker fullness to my front hairline! My middle part seems to be a less thick line too. I can't tell on my cowlick, maybe ever so slightly a bit darker from new hairs. I trialed not using it for a month while I traveled a ton. Some of that darkening faded, but not completely. I didn't notice more fallout than usual. If you stop using or don't use most days, results will diminish. After 6 months, my front hair line hairs are actually now down to a bang length! I can also put the awkward hair in front of my ears behind them, it doesn't just stick back out again, and some longer strands started to pull it all back into my pony. And more of my back hairs are reaching my ponytail again. That's the thing I did want it to help with! My back hairline broken hair has definitely gotten longer and healthier, I have less broken hairs falling out, and I think I'll have a bigger improvement here in the next 6 months. I did not expect a miracle, I still have quite a bit of hair where balding isn't noticeable, and so I'm pleased with the results knowing a peptide serum has a limit to what it can do. I've also switched brushes, to a microfiber towel and satin pillowcases too. Even spilling a good chunk of the bottle, it lasted me this 8 months since I don't put it on my whole head. The serum dropper is not the ideal format, but it helps me get direct on the scalp. I'll order another and see how long I stay consistent. I do like this is helping broken hairs grow back and preventing some slight signs of losing hairs. It's not pointless, but it is subtle. The subtleness over time is what will produce noticeable results.",1

The Ordinary,Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,$15.00 - $22.80,"I bought this a few years ago after I had gotten so frustrated with my hair after the post baby shed. My hair was thin (especially around my face, looked like I had a receding hair line at my temples). After years of hoping the post baby regowth would magically appear and continuously cutting my hair short so everything could catch up, I gave up, and then found this product. Now, you have to be patient and consistent. You might not notice anything after you finish the first bottle, it does take time, but there is a pay off. I have been using it consistently for a couple of years now and my hair is so much thicker than when I started. The last time my hair was this thick was when I was a little kid. No, its not my hair bouncing back post baby shed, I waited for five years for that to happen and it never did. I found this, tried it, and I will continue to recommend this product. Use it at night before you go to bed. If you use too much your hair will be a little greasy, but if you use as directed your hair won't look and feel greasy. There's no smell, there's no residue, and I've never had any issues with my scalp being irritated in any way when using this product. Give it a go. Also, their lash and brow serum is amazing. My lashes are fuller and longer and it rescued my thin millennial brows (also be patient with that, all good things take time).",5

I am in the process of getting by blood work and ultrasound done to find out what's going on and wanted to try this serum meanwhile to help with the hair regrowth. I used a few drop of the serum all over my scalp and lightly massaged it with my fingers for a few minutes, let it stay overnight and washed it the next morning with my regular shampoo, followed by conditioner. I have used the serum 3-4 times, every few days but found that my hair fall has increased even more after using this so I have decided to not continue anymore.

The Ordinary,Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,$15.00 - $22.80,I have been using this on and off on my scalp and eyebrows. I really can't tell if there is much of an improvement but will continue for a few more bottles to notice some improvement. It does cause some break out along the hairline. But I am really confused at the number of reviews saying that they ard using it on their skin and it's breaking them out. It is not for the face to begin with.,1

The Ordinary,Azelaic Acid 10% Suspension Brightening Cream,$12.20,I bought this alpha arbutin serum to diminish dark spots. I used it twice a day for a week or two. Then my skin reacted with stinging when even moisturizers were applied. Flaking occured in areas of my face that normally don't flake. I underestimated the effects of lactic acid in this serum. I have tried The Ordinary 10% lactic acid serum and had the same reaction. I mistakenly thought this lactic acid was too far down the ingredient list to cause problems and would benefit the skin lightening effect of alpha arbutin. But who knows because I can't continue using it until my skin barrier gets back to normal. My recommendation is to use this at night with a good moisturizer and don't use twice a day until your skin can handle it.,4.2
The Ordinary,Azelaic Acid 10% Suspension Brightening Cream,$12.20,I got this when I was having a bad perioral dermatitis flare up and it helped SO MUCH!

When i tell you that my skin LOVES this stuff. I only use it at night after my toner and it seriously work at keeping the acne away and evening your skin tone.

I was hoping this could replace my Azelaic acid from the pharmacy, but definitely not. I did see some improvement in my complexion at first and then white bumps started showing up all over my face and neck.

Certainly not as extreme as a squalane based serum, but I need 5-10 minutes to be absorbed (on my skin at least). Always test before use!",4.2

I have the Paula's Choice, and it's very nice, but more than triple the cost. This works just as well. Note that this is a moisturizer (of sorts) and it is surprisingly thick. I put some on my fingertips and rub until the consistency is thinner and warmed up. Then pat around my face before rubbing in. It feels nice after an over the counter retinoid.",1
The Ordinary,Azelaic Acid 10% Suspension Brightening Cream,$12.20,This is a no for me. As soon as I start working it into my skin it dries and becomes matte. This product is way too heavy on the silicone. I t made me very dry and made my makeup pill terribly bad.,5

This was probably beacause I was using other products like the ordinary toner and benoxly wash with it so I decided to stop using all of my acne products and sticked to only using a gentle face wash for dry skin and a hydrating moisturizer and sunscreen everyday for a week. Then I decided to give this product another try..BEST DECISION EVERRR!!! Its been only a week of using just this product with my usual skincare and most of my textured skin is already gone. 70% of my acne is disappearing and a lot of my old acen scars of semi-gone.

First few days I tried it in order of cleansing first, serum 2nd, and than moisturizer last. It dried out my skin out and it seem to sit on the skin, and than I put my moisturizer on. So after trying it that way for a few days, I researched on the internet and found people mixing it with moisturizer. After doing that quite a few times, my hyperpigmentation and melasma have started to fade quicker than expected. That was within a month. I do this in the am and pm.

I want to love this because of what it claims to do and because of the price point, but it just doesn't work for me.",5

The Ordinary,Azelaic Acid 10% Suspension Brightening Cream,$12.20,"It says you can't use it with vitamin C or a retinol, which is absurd because there is no issue using those together with the prescription form. It's not the Azleic acid that conflicts, so it must be another ingredient in the product. The formula seems to go on smooth, but the bottle is only half full so it will last about one week. I'm going to look for a different brand next time.",5

This serum shouldn't be your primary eye product. The only reason I had to stop using the serum was because the bottle expired really quickly. I didn't even get through 1/3 of the bottle.

Now to get to the actual point of the review I wanted to get to. I noticed in some peoples reviews they notice piling throughout the day or even some issues with mixing certain things. If you go to The Ordinary's website, it tells you what not to mix with their products. And for piling and things- make sure that if you have a water-based skincare routine to not use oils until last step or make sure that you're waiting long enough for your skin care products to absorb. I definitely noticed I had issues with the piling and stuff whenever I wouldn't wait long enough for certain steps to dry or if I applied my sunscreen way too soon. I hope this helps some people!",5

The Ordinary,Multi-Peptide + Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Aging Skin,$19.90,"since 2021 I've mostly been using this. I occasionally try other products, but this is ol' reliable. I prefer not too many actives in the AM, but it's nice to have peptides and amino acids to help hydrate & start the day. I am just starting to develop fine lines, so I can't say that this helps with it (can't stop aging, it'll happen eventually 😜) but this serum keeps the dullness away and gives a bit of that skincare glow (thank you, peptides!)",5

But redness is a hard thing to get rid of, so i will give this grace. It sooths my skin amd gives me a nice glow! Im getting a cream from my derm.

As a result, there are almost ALWAYS chewed up looking red spots and scabs on my neck that can never heal before shaving again. Simply 4 to 5 drops of this spread evenly over that area over shaving has my neck cleared up for the first time in years. I've also found this is great for any part of the body where the skin has been compromised and scabbed over. This in combo with the hyaluronic acid and niacinamide and a good lotion has left me feeling confident about my face consistently and I'm simply over the moon about it < 3",1

My face looks and feels nearly the same except I now dont get greasy like their regular moisturizer gets me greasy. It also smells like wet paint yall. I'm not exaggerating or kidding even a little bit. It smells EXACTLY like you freshly painted the walls. The smell does dissipate fairly quickly (within thirty minutes or less). Im hoping to get better results as time goes on. Other moisturizer's have given me quicker results than this. And yes, I've researched this product and am using it appropriately and with the products I'm supposed to use in conjuction with it. Yes, I'm also using the appropriate amount. I've used the Ordinary products for years and love them. Hopefully I'll love this one too.",1

The Ordinary,Retinol 0.5% in Squalane Serum,$8.60,"I love love this retinol and its price point. A few notes after reading other reviews, it does not take much, I use maybe 1/4 of a dropper. Let it sit for a minute or two before putting on moisturizer. it is of course an oil based serum and will absorp slower than a traditional retinol cream. if you have sensitive skin, do not use on your eyelid/undereye and get a seperate eye retinol cream (I like the roc one). Do not be surprised if your acne gets worse at first, your skin probably needed a purge. Keep your routine simple and limit other actives at the same time especially vit c or salicylic acid. do not exfoliate the same night. Use it every other day at most when you start, less often if it is your first retinol. The formula is to die for if you use it properly, I never have any redness or dry patches with it. I have combo/oily skin and it is so hydrating and great at keeping my skin barrier happy. As always WEAR SPF!!!",4.1
The Ordinary,Retinol 0.5% in Squalane Serum,$8.60,I have been using this for 2 weeks and i have noticed a difference. It has diminished the melasma and made my skin more even tone.

I will definitely recommend and purchase again.,5
The Ordinary,Retinol 0.5% in Squalane Serum,$8.60,"I've never gone out of my way to write a review on a product before, but this specific serum is worth writing one. Being 100% honest, this product should be more expensive for how good it feels on the skin. Speaking for my skin specifically, it cleared up some acne, made it feel 10x softer, and gave me glass skin before bed. Now, it claims that it anti-ages your skin, we'll see in 10 years. I can't speak on that now. I will always repurchase this product because of how glowy, soft, and rejuvenated my skin feels/looks after. Everyone should try this prdouct at least once to see if it does wonders to their skin as it did mine. I'm hoping it does!!! For my first review, this is pretty long lol.",3

It's nothing bad about it, I just realize my skin doesn't do well with oils. But it's AMAZING for the body. It's super smooth, and silky, and almost cushiony in a way. It's lightweight too.

The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,Hi I'm 43 years old and once I hit 40 my skin got dry. That was new to me since all of my life I fought oily skin. 10 years ago I never would've thought of applying an oil to my skin. But in the last few years my skin just soaks everything up and still remains dry. This has been wonderful. It has really improved my skin tone.

The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"I think ANY oil may risk breaking some of us out. That said, i was pleasantly surprised by how well this absorbed into my skin while I used it to Gua Sha. It has a slight yellow tint, which does create a ""glow"" when combined with the shine of the oil. My skin feel supple and soft after I use it. Some days I just buff the oil in by gently rubbing it with a dry towel after its had a moment to absorb. Sometimes I rinse it off with a cool washcloth after I Gua Sha. Sometimes I use it at night in place of my gel moisturizer because it does make my skin soft. Overall I like it!",1
The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"I don't typically review immediately after the first use but I jumped straight on here because y'all need to KNOW. This stuff feels SO GOOD. I have combination skin leaning toward oily and I also get eczema. All the oil control products flare my eczema, conversely eczema products make me super oily. I tried to find a happy medium with products for mature skin, but no. Tonight I used my cleanser, an AHA toner, applied Ordinary's lactic acid, then Ordinary's Rose Hip Seed Oil, then my moisturizer. When I tell you my skin hasn't been this soft and comfortable in 30 years, I am saying the last time my skin felt even close to this comfortable I was TWELVE YEARS OLD. Its such a light oil…within 5 minutes your skin just soaks it up and feels so soft and flawless. My 6 year old daughter is napping next to me as I write this, and my cheek is as soft as her cheek. No itching, no tightness, no greasy film just sitting on top of my skin. I am absolutely astonished. I feel like one application erased years of using the wrong products for my skin. I am officially converted and brand-loyal. Putting this stuff on subscription…",5

The only thing i dont like is as it gets older and used it started to get gummy and crusty around the top so you gotta clean it off once in awhile and it the oil does have a weird smell lol but it doesnt bother my skin at all",4
The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"I was looking for a face oil, i recently started my skin healing journey. I had a damaged skin barrier; and i didn't know i did until i started breaking out randomly really bad, my face had a bunch of tiny white papules on the front of my cheeks, i had redness for days, and not to mention the random cystic acne as well. My skin was DRY and tight but oily at the same time. I was having dry patches and underneath it.. OILY. I used to shave my peachfuzz on my sideburns, (Dermaplaning), which only added to my dryness and irritation. Not to mention i was using a very stripping facewash. Regular face lotions wernt cutting it. I even tried CeraVe and all it did was break me out, like itchy and uncomfortable breaking out! So i invested in this wonderful oil. I use it right out of the shower or after washing my face with the Cetaphil hydrating foaming cleanser. The oil does have an earthy smell but nothing too overbearing. Its light! Doesn't bother me at all and im actually prone to headaches if i smell strong scents. So no need to worry about the scent. This oil has really helped rebuild my skin barrier! I couldn't even pop a pimple because my nails would peel my skin! It was that bad! This oil doesn't feel greasy at all. Its a very light oil. Does not break me out at all! If anything it has helped my breakouts. It calms the redness right down when im breaking out all over my cheeks and it has helped with redness in general that i always had. My skin feels so soft now, bounces back, has stopped having dry patches, and does not injure easily as it did before. Im so happy with this face oil. Only con i would have to say is that it sits on top of your skin for about an hour if you dont put a mositurizer on top, which isn't necessary a bad thing because i appreciate the extra layer of protection between my skin and the freezing dry air this winter. I really love this oil so much and im thankful i found this. I would like to add however once again, that you do need to use a mositurizer on top because the oil is not enough for this cold winter air. I use the neutrogena hydro boost on top of the oil. Extremely happy with this product. Will purchase again!",4.4
The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"I have used this face oil for a couple of years now and although I love how it makes my skin feel when added to my night skin routine, the smell is awful.

The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"I started using this about two weeks ago and I'm pretty satisfied. As stated in other reviews, it does have an unpleasant smell, but you don't want perfumey products on your face anyway. So. I use this following my hydroboost moisturizer and its made a noticable difference in my dry skin and the overall look of my skin. It does moisturize and I would argue, for me anyway, helps with uneven skin tones and redness. I'm glad I bought it!",2
The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"Feels a bit oily at first but then it is quickly absorbed into your skin, leaving it silky and soft. Works wonders on my daughter's sensitive skin due to eczema. Highly recommend!",5
The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"this stuff is great for moisture in my nighttime routine. I put 3-4 small drops before bed, and I haven't broken out, my face looks lovely and feels smooth in the morning! my only complaint, and maybe I'm using something wrong, is that I also use the niacinimide and hyaluronic acid drops at night as well as both of those say to use in the PM. I put them on first, let them dry for a few mins, but when I put the rose seed oil on over the other two, they just don't mix well and my face feels all gritty. Still ok in the morning, but I've just been alternating- one night niacinimide + hyaluronic acid, one night rose hip seed oil alone and that seems to work ok!",3
The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"My daughter actually recommended this product to me years ago and the moment I tried it I was hooked.

The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"Cleared up ly dry winter skin within a week! Great replacement for primer in winter months. Does smell earthy, but fades quickly. Pair it with the marine lock serum and neutrogena hyrdo boost water gel",5

The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"I have dry, acne-prone, sensitive skin, and this seems to help. I've brrn through maybe four bottles now. I'd say it seems to help, switched to this from a retinol that kept me in an unending purging phase — I read rosehip seed oil can help with acne scarring/marks. So far I haven't seen any evidence of that, but I still really like it for addressing dryness and topping off a slightly sticky-textured serum I use with a high glycerin content to help my skin feel smooth and supple.",5
The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,Rosehip oil has amazing benefits but it can also cause breakouts for acne prone skin. I have not had breakouts in like this since highschool and the only change was adding this to my gua sha routine.,5

The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"For the price I do love how it makes my skin feel in the morning. The smell is pretty bad though.

The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"I have been using rose hip seed oil as a part of my skincare for years.

Like someone vomited last nights dinner on your face. I have to hold my breath while putting this on because if I get a whiff I will audibly gag. So maybe try another brand.",5
The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"Amazing, within days my skin has tremendously improved.

The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"The oil itself has a really nice feel and absorbs into the skin well, but it gave me a retinol burn & made my skin irritated, bumpy, and discolored after use.

The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"Ok im only writing a comment because that girl Ashleigh from Seattle commented with a stupid perspective and it shouldnt sway you from purchasing based off of her prefrence in smell. The product is amazing. You dont even need a lot. (To me) it gives like a lite olive oil vibe. With a light smell that reminds me of like a dark oil like olive or avacado or even almond oils I usually get from wholes food. I personally do 1 or 2 drops in my hand. My Bf has acne issues with horrible break outs and scarring and this really has transformed his face in a positive direction. He loves it which means i love it for us. He does the drops around his T Zone. I just do 1-2 drops in my hand after a cleanser (la roshe purifying foaming wash) and its lasted 3 months. I have oily skin, and 1 drop at night does me good until the next night. PLEASE BUY ill be there this week for my next one. The smell is faint and fades in 5 secs.",2

The Ordinary,100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,$10.90,"I use this product with several other steps from The Ordinary. I use it before applying my moisturizer and it is very oily. Yes, I understand it's an oil but I wasn't expecting the greasy feeling to last so long. A little bit definitely goes a long way! I apply it both day and night and the next morning when I wake up my skin is super soft but still pretty oily. I don't think it has a fish smell like some other reviews say. I think it smellys rosey and earthy. I also use it on my hands for extra moisurizer when needed and it works great for that too! Overall, I recommend at least trying it and giving it a few weeks before you decide whether you like it or not. Give it time to work.",2

I've recently had 3 totally random comments about how good my complexion looks (I've never had happen before)!

The Ordinary,Multi-Peptide Anti-Aging Eye Serum,$25.00,This product works. I have both under eye serums and this one is by far the best. I can now write a legitimate review after so much use that this eye serum actually works. It shouldn't dry out or burn it's just an oily base. It takes away my dark circles I don't have puffy under eyes only dark circles. I have very sensitive skin that easily breaks out as well this and the product with the pink color are by far the best on here and I've used many.,5
The Ordinary,Multi-Peptide Anti-Aging Eye Serum,$25.00,"Within maybe five minutes of applying this eye serum as directed I felt a burning, tingling sensation around one eye. I immediately washed it off and the sensation went away. I have NEVER had a reaction like this to a skin care product and I try a lot of random products. Everything else I've tried from this brand has been good, but I will be returning this.",1

I was using the glycolic acid toner and while it was good, it did seem to bring out the redness in my skin more than I would like. When I changed to this toner I no longer had that problem. It does its job as a lightly exfoliating toner but still feels soothing. It definitely doesn't have the sting of the old toners (Seabreeze anyone? My fellow GenXers know). I use this after I cleanse with the Squalane cleanser and before the serums that I love . I highly recommend this toner.",1

I still continued to use it for about a month and I felt like it was an alright toner for my skin aside from the weird feeling on my lips. Eventually my lips started to shred. Like, not just peel from being dry, but shred like I've never experienced. After about a week of that I stopped using the toner altogether. Within a few days the corners of my mouth became open sores that would crack and bleed then scab over. I'm now using an anti fungal ointment that is helping to heal the corners of my mouth. I guess this toner made my lips peel to the point it made me susceptible to an infection? So long story short: if this makes your lips feel funny just return it, don't keep using it.",5

Make sure you give it a good shake too.",1
The Ordinary,Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner,$14.00,"I have tried SO many skincare products, most of which either seem to make my skin break out or don't make any real noticeable difference (many other Ordinary products included). This toner, however… GAME CHANGER. My skin has never looked more glowy and smooth. Breakouts are pretty much non-existent when I use this, and if I have to go a few days without it, I can really tell a difference. I use this morning and night after double cleansing and before using Vanicream moisturizer. I don't even wear makeup as much because I love the way my skin looks.

I have dry skin, so I was somewhat surprised to see a product with such a simple ingredients list and mostly hydrating ingredients do this. Just because it broke me out doesn't mean it will for you too, so if have acne prone skin you're curious, try it and keep the receipt. Also is slightly annoying how small the bottle is, The Ordinary products are definitely getting smaller and more expensive posg-acquisition. You can definitely get similar milky toner products from Asian brands for cheaper on sites like Stylevana.",4.6

I had to stop using the glycolic acid due to developing skin issues and i had been waiting for the ordinary to drop another toner. This is perfect for sensitive skin. My skin isnt dull after, no burning or irritation, not stripping. It calms my redness and inflammation a bit. The smell is different but it is a fermented product so thats to be expected.

The Ordinary,Natural Moisturizing Factors + PhytoCeramides Rich Moisturizer,$22.50,I have severely dry skin like I drink enough water so I was trying to find a product that would actually make me feel hydrated on the surface of my skin. Phytoceramides is the only ingredient that actually makes me feel hydrated on the top. I know other moisturizers that do it's job under the surface but sadly my skin doesn't really feel it. I will say this is more of a night time moisturizer. As for makeup I just usually put a thin layer of aquaphor under my makeup and it does the job. I recommend this to anyone who needs surface hydration on their skin.,1

After using this for 15 days, I had many clogged pores, bumps, and acne. I have dry sensitive skin and although it did make my skin hydrated (I think), there are significantly more negative things this product did that made my skin worse.

But I cannot recommend this enough!",1
The Ordinary,100% Plant-Derived Squalane Skin and Hair Hydrator Serum,$10.40,"I got this to moisturize my skin before makeup. I've tried multiple moisturizers but they just mess with the texture of my makeup even if I waited for it to absorb, or they'd make my skin get super greasy under my makeup after an hour regardless of how lightweight the moisturizer was. I wanted something super lightweight that felt natural and wouldn't affect my makeup. You only need 2-3 drops for the whole face, it feels like it doesn't spread far cause its so thin but trust me it does. If you use more it'll leave you oily. It takes about 5-10mins to absorb but once it does it feels completely natural like your skin but hydrated. I blot my face once it absorbs to get any excess off. If you have oily skin you'll probably want the hyaluronic serum since that one is water based, I haven't tried it though.",5
The Ordinary,100% Plant-Derived Squalane Skin and Hair Hydrator Serum,$10.40,"This is a good alternative to oils for skin and hair. I bought it for my damaged skin barrier, but it works better for actual skin problems. It actually healed stabbed over skin in a day. I happened to use it on a wound that had a scab and the scab came off the next day with no bleeding and only light pink skin. I tried it soon after on a rug burn with the same result. Amazing.

I apply this as my second to last night time skincare routine, and follow it with CeraVe in the tub. You need to apply TO Squalane oil immediately after water based products , and BEFORE sunscreen or moisturizer. Applying this as the last step of a makeup routine is the dumbest thing i have read here. I guess if you want to take your makeup off, that would work.

I've definitely noticed a reduction in the lines I was originally targeting. My forehead used to be textured and bumpy and is much smoother now. I'm happier with my skin at age 30 than I was in my mid-20s. My skincare routine is pretty minimal (wash face once a day, vitamin C serum twice a week, 30 spf cream every morning, this retinoid serum twice a week, and Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors every night) and I sometimes slack off on the vitamin C. I also rarely wear makeup, so my skin isn't reacting to different products all the time. That's all to say: there are very few competing factors at play in monitoring my skin's reaction to this serum over time and I believe it delivers consistent results at a good price. My skin looks so refreshed the morning after using this, as long as I get enough sleep. It's a good addition to a simple routine, but no one product is going to perform miracles. If you stay moisturized, wear sun protection, and get enough sleep, this serum will add that extra boost to help rejuvenate your skin. Also, I keep my serums in the fridge and usually stretch them past the 3 month mark.",5

I am 32 and have seen a reduction in fine lines and my skin is brighter. You cant beat the price either!

It works incredibly well under makeup and sunscreen — no pilling whatsoever!! It also doesnt cause my skin to peel, get flaky, or feel dry and tight, which were common issues I've had with other products that claim to reduce oiliness. In my 30s, I have had new ongoing issues with acne along my jaw and chin. This is the only product that's helped reduce that issue completely when I use it consistently morning and night. Only a few drops are needed for my face (don't need a whole droppers' worth). About that smell….I have an incredibly sensitive nose. It's unfortunately true that this product smells bad. It is not rancid, it just smells that way. I apply this product to my face, let it dry down for a minute or two, and then put my moisturizer on top. The odor dissipates a few minutes later after it dries/my skin absorbs the product, usually in less than 15 minutes. This serum works so well for me that I don't mind dealing with the odor.

I've built up this routine gradually over the last few months and it's really paying off! I think patience and sticking to it is the key! I honestly don't want to put makeup on anymore because I'm loving how my skin is looking! This retinal has a yellow hue but if you're only using one pump, letting it sink in and follow with moisturizer, it's really not an issue.",4.3
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I have just finished my first bottle of this and am making my way through my second. I had a bit of irritation the first few weeks with some dryness and red patches but built up slowly and my skin can tolerate it now. I use this six nights a week and have one day off from any actives. I can use it around my eyes, on my eyelids, on my neck and the back of my, hands without irritation but I have built up to this. My skin does look clearer and crow's feet are not as prominent. I will keep using it if and until they bring out a higher-strength formula. I am 54.",4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"Can we get this in another package, because this is often not working, and also some stronger options as well? From 0,2 to 0,6? That would be nice. This is way better than retinol, and we need more of this.",2
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I do like how smooth this goes on and how easy it absorbs into my skin. BUT, i have some peeling going on my forehead and cheeks. This is the only thing different that I've used. Hoping it's peeling to reveal brighter skin fingers crossed",5

The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"It delivers. The skin on my face and neck is noticeably smoother, firmer and evenly textured. Lines and pores are diminished. Initially experienced mild peeling/flaking but that quickly settled down. Dosing. I found a pea size amount as recommended insufficient to spread a thin layer across face, front and back of neck. 5 pumps required for me. The colour. It will stain pillows and other white/light fabrics with a yellow tint",4.3
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"Love this emulsion! Not oily, absorbs quickly and no irritation whatsoever. I can tell my skin texture looks better. The only issue is the pump, I pumped for ages and I turned it upside down as suggested, nothing happened so I had to remove the top part and literally cut the seal with scissors to be able to use the product. I gave it 4 star instead of 5 because of the pump.",4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I have only started since around October of2023 to use any type of retinol, all The Ordinary.

The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"In the directions it says not to apply it to the eye contour, but it also says in the description that this Retinal improves the look of crows feet. May/Should we use it around our eyes or not?",4

The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"Dear users of the ordinary, grow up! So many of you complained about the yellow tint I had to write this. Yes, you get a bit yellowish so what? Use it before going to bed. It works and that's the only what matters. I'm a 40-year-old and recently I found out that all my colleagues thought I was 28. Thanks to the ordinary products and my good genes my skin is in excellent condition. Yellow you say? I don't mind if it's green of blue for as long as is support my skin health.",4

The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"Anyone giving this a bad review is using it wrong. You only need a pea size drop for the whole face and are supposed to use it one to two times a week. This product has made a landslide difference in my skin care. At first I was not seeing results with the ordinary products but decided to just do the suggested regime and added a few products. After using the line for a few weeks I have seen a drastic difference in my skin as a whole and will never go back to my old routine. Rather then seeing just temporary changes I'm seeing permanent real change in my pores, density, elasticity and the glow! Take the time to look up instructions on each product it makes a difference.",5
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"Had 3 uses of this product, and could not expel more out of the tube. I even took the top off to see if this was really all of the product. For the price, I got 3 small sized pumps (about a pea size for reference). Very disappointed, buyer beware.",5

The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I received this product for free from Influenster and The Ordinary in exchange for my honest review. I have been really enjoying this The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulsion. I've noticed after a few weeks that my pores seem to be smaller and those little fine lines have started to smooth out. It absorbs nicely into my skin. I did deal with a bit of overdrying for the first week or two but now it's an affordable part of my skin care routine.,4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,The packaging is the worst I've ever come across in my life. Nothing came out and I had to cut the entire tube open to get anything out.,2
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I really didn't see much of a difference it's supposed to be a lightning and tightening serum and I used it for over a month every other day for about a month and I didn't see much difference I definitely would not buy this it's very creamy and absorbs right into your skin it does make your skin a little bit dry and the areas you put it in it has no smell it's unscented and I do like the little bottle that it comes in,5
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I am 47 and had pronounced forehead lines from frowning. Retinol serum was working well to reduce the lines. Then I tried this. One application and my lines have reduced so dramatically I look 20 years younger! No sensitivity at all but did apply another brand of HA serum first and plenty of moisturiser afterwards. Highly recommend!! In shock tbh haha!,5

Not blow away, but not bad.",2
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"Effective smooths skin after prescribed use. My skin is soft, smooth and glowing just after several weeks of usage (literally used once a week for 2 weeks and then twice in one week). A little goes a long way. Perfect for low maintenance skincare for aging skin. (I'm in my mid-late 40s). Please remember to not use on sensitive areas.",5
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I really like this product. I swapped from an expensive retinal product to this and they are similar in results... but the yellow tone is very strong and gets left in my hair line and eyebrows. Its also transfered to my white pillow case too. Good product but better to use less liberally.,5
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I've used this consistently for weeks now on my very sensitive, dry/combo skin - it's the best I've tolerated any form of retinol/retinal so far! It does tingle a bit when I put it on & my skin is a bit more sensitive on nights when I use it/the day after, BUT when I wake up in the morning after putting it on, my skin looks juicy, plump & fresh. Much more so than when I just use the other products in my routine!",4.3
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I enjoyed first off that there was not a harsh chemical smell as I have found on several other products. This goes on smooth and doesn't have a tacky feel to it. I did notice a slight difference in the fine lines and would just need to use this more to see a bigger difference. I received this produce at no cost in exchange for my honest review.,4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I'm have been fan of ordinary, for a while and using 5% Retinol. So, I switch to the Retinal 0.2 Great product. But be careful using it everyday if you don't want a peeling mask. I made the mistake because there no irritation",2
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I have never used a retinal emulsion prior to this one. However, after using for almost a month, I am a huge fan. Goes on about without feeling sticky. My skin has noticeably improved texture and diminished fine lines. There was very little scent to the product which I also loved. I don't think you can beat this product at this price point.",4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,This product goes on smooth without a smell. However not sure if it does what it says. I didn't see any fading of dark spots or wrinkles probably wouldn't purchase again,4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,This is a great retinol product. I love the consistency of it and how light it feels on the skin. It did not make me purge and I did see some improvement when using it.,4.3
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"This product is great and I would definitely reccomend to anybody looking for an affordable retiniod! After aboir two weeks of usage i've notced my pores are so much smaller!

The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I used this retinol serum on my melanin skin for a month. It was light weight and applied smooth. The texture felt great. It had no hard ordor or scent. It works effectively and left my skin feeling young and smooth.,4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I brought this about 2 week ago and have used it 3 times. Makes my face yellow and transferred to my pillowcases.,5
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,The Ordinary Retinal Emulsion cream has improved the look of my facial skin over the last 4 weeks. It is a light moisturizer cream that doesn't really have much of a scent. The pump bottle is nice to control the amount used because it doesn't take a lot of product to cover the entire face. The elasticity of my skin is improving and the texture of my skin is smoother. This cream did dry my face out at first but over time that seemed to improve.,4.3
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"Unreal! This serum is incredibly effective in evening out my skin tone, improving my skin texture and just making the overall appearance clearer and brighter. It feels light and smooth and absorbs immediately. Love it and will purchase when I run out.",4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"This is the gentlest retinol product I've ever used, which is nice for my sensitive skin. It doesn't absorb perfectly on its own though, you have to be really aware of getting every bit of it rubbed in.",2
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I've never used a retinal emulsion so I had no idea what to expect. However, after using this once to twice a week for about a month, my skin definitely has improved texture and my fine lines have diminished. And please don't let the yellow color turn you away, this retinal is fantastic. Affordable and effective. Yes yes yes.",4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I was really excited to receive this product because I have not used this brand before, but I've heard wonderful things .Unfortunately, I couldn't use this product more than once because it made my skin breakout and burn. The product seemed to be kind of greasy and didn't absorb well on my skin. within about 10 minutes my face was burning and I had to wash it off. My skin is not sensitive but I did have a problem with this product. unfortunately, due to my experience I would not recommend this product to others.",5
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"The product absorbs quickly. After the second week of using it as instructed (that's only twice in 2 weeks), I noticed my dark spots from old acne cysts looked lighter. The product is very effective. However, it made my face dry so I use a hydration booster serum before applying it. Works well for me this way. I would definitely recommend!",4.3
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I've been a big fan of The Ordinary for a long time. I'm 47 and desperately trying to keep my skin in good shape. This is another great product in their lineup. It's effective for an OTC products and has a great price point.,4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I priced improvements on the texture of my skin as well as my skin started to feel smoother as I kept using it it did not break me out or irritated my skin thankfully during my use of the product I did not notice any significant fragrance in the product,2
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"Overall, I feel that this is an excellent beginner retinal cream that's also super affordable. And although there is a yellow tint, it blends completely. I use at night and have noticed more hydrated and softer skin.",4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I have been using this retinal for almost a month, 6 days per week and it has been amazing , love the yellow that comes with it, my skin looks much better and the tone is amazing. love this serum , thanks ordinary =)",3
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I did notice some slight improvement in fine lines. I think with more regular use I could see further results. It goes on smooth without leaving residue. I did not have any negative side effects. I only had a concern regarding the off putting yellow color of the product.,4.3
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,This helped my skin feel smoother and helped with some smaller breakout problems I've been having. It helped even out my skin texture. Also my skin is super sensitive and this didn't irritate it. It felt smooth and light and didn't leave my skin feeling oily or sticky.,4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,This is a great option for an affordable retinol product. It does the same thing as more expensive brands. I had no negative reactions to skin while using this. There is no scent which I like.,2
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I received a sample size to try and as everyone knows you can not really get a good feel for skincare in samples. There's no miracle, works the very first time, cure all product. So I've been giving this my best go. I only applied weekly as instructed since I'm newer to retinols and do tend to be sensitive. I didn't have enough to work up to more than that. A pea size was all that was needed and it went on nicely, no immediate irritation and my skin felt smooth. In the morning my cheeks were redder than usual and after washing my face and doing my makeup I noticed only the days I had used this the night before, my makeup wouldn't sit well. It was separating and my pores seemed larger. My skin was softer though but a little dry although I already have dry skin. I feel over time my skin would adapt and it would be a good addition to my routine and luckily it won't break the bank either.",4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,This is a great option for an affordable retinol product. It does the same thing as more expensive brands. I had no negative reactions to skin while using this. There is no scent which I like.,5
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I have sensitive skin & have had some serious issues with retinal in the past. This is the first retinal I've been able to use over a long period of time that didn't cause me to have skin issues. The product itself goes on smoothly like a lightweight lotion and is at a great price point compared to other retinal options. Since it wasn't as harsh as others, I feel it took longer for results. But I'd honestly rather have that than red and painful skin.",4.3
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I'm definitely beginning to see the difference underneath my eyes. I noticed my dark under eye is becoming lighter after a couple weeks of using. It was easy to apply and it blended will with my moisturizer. I even see a glow after such a short time of using. I can't wait to see the result after a few months of using.,4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,This retinal from the ordinary has the perfect strength for me it has helped with my fine lines and wrinkles. it does not make my skin too sensitive. I really have enjoyed it. I recommend it for anyone who needs help with their fine lines and wrinkles. You may want to just use it once weekly at first. i use it twice a week.,2
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"This eye cream provides smoothness and hydration. While my main concerns are dark circles and under-eye dryness, I've noticed improvement in a short period of time since using this product. I'm excited to see even more improvement with continued use.",4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I was pleased with the performance of this product. It wasn't massive, but my face looked a bit more fresh in the morning after use. The texture and scent were reasonable and I didn't feel tacky, oily or sticky.",5
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"So this retinol serum was not it for me. Everything seemed fine at first, but soon my skin became dry and flaky, especially near my eyebrows. Other than that, I did not notice any difference. When I stopped using it, my skin returned to normal. I don't think this is a problem specific to this product, as I've tried other retinol products in the past and gotten similar results. Because of this, I cannot recommend this product. Also, the sickly yellow color was really off-putting.",4.3
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,Awesome packaging and no intense scent. Goes well with other products. Love the way it makes my skin feel great addition to my skin care routine.,4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I received this product few in exchange for my honest opinion. I feel like The Ordinary brand is a little underrated overall. I use a couple of their products in my daily routine so I was excited to try. I love that it isn't too harsh and there's not a strong scent. There's no scent at all to me. I feel like I need more time to know the long term effects but so far so good. I would definitely recommend if you are a little on the sensitive or reactive side.,2
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I would definitely buy this again! It's a brand I already trust, and it simply works! I like the packaging. The cream has a yellow tint and does tint your skin so I recommend using it only at night. It did dry my skin out but that's from the retinol and to be expected.",1
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I'm surprised how smooth this emulsion is with a very pleasant smell. Not sure I used it long enough to see a complete change but I will continue to use,5
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I received The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulsion face and neck cream about four weeks ago. I used it once.per week the first two weeks and then once every three days the second two weeks. Th cream is yellow in color and it's easy to blend and dries or absorbs pretty quickly. It does not leave an oily look or a greasy residue on your skin. A very little bit goes a long way, around a pea sized amount is enough to do your whole face and neck one time . I cannot say definitively that it produced any results that were good or bad. I honestly did not notice a change in my complexion or texture or otherwise, aside from one thing. After applying it, approximately 2 hours later, my skin gets a bit red. Also, for thirty minutes after applying it, I get a warm and tingly, almost hot sensation, on my face. I read that it is normal to experience some peeling and changes in skin texture, but I'm pretty sure that is only the first few times of use. I don't know, but this product, unlike the majority of other skin care products, my results have been uncertain and indefinite.",4.3
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"I have been using this product consistently for the last three weeks and I love it! I'm in my mid-40's and this seems to be one product that I actually see results from - and so quickly too. I know retinols tend to be harsh, but my skin is generally sensitive and I've had no issues at all. I also tend to still get acne pretty frequently, and this product helped reduce the texture from those old acne bumps. It's not scented, but there is a bit of an earthly smell to it. Not too bad. Overall, it's 100% a product I will repurchase again and again.",4
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,I love how this makes my skin feel! After using it for a few weeks now I can tell a big difference in my skin. I hope it will continue to improve my skin even more!,2
The Ordinary,Retinal 0.2% Emulsion,$14.90,"After using the product a few times, my skin did not react well. I had to discontinue the use of it. I don't normally have reactions to products, so it was a bit concerning.",3
The Ordinary,Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,$8.10,"First if all, it legit smells like diarrhea.

The texture is a little gritty but I only use it at bedtime. Also, I wait a while before layering the next product/serum so there's not a problem with them clumping together. For those who prefer a smoother texture, the Ordinary makes Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone. I tried that one as well but I prefer this one with HA Sphere 2%. The Ordinary is the best. I use several of their products, they are very affordable.",5

The Ordinary,Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,$8.10,Absolutely love this serum! It is a gritty texture and takes some time for your skin to get used to. My skin texture was great in a few weeks! 10/10 recommend using it at night though. The texture is not compatible to be applied under makeup,5
The Ordinary,Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,$8.10,This isnt a luxurious lotion to wear under make up- i have dark spots and textured skin- i will use this at night and wake up with smoother more refreshed skin almost like the gritty texture helps remove dead skin.

The Ordinary,Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,$8.10,Ordinary products are great. It works. Noone believes my age. I also use pycnogenol and Noone in the store seems to know what it is.

I use this 2x a month to keep the melasma away from my face and body. Yes it's grainy, that's the encapsulated vitamin C which keeps it from degrading!

The Ordinary,Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,$8.10,"I had read previous reviews about this product and decided to try it for myself. Directions suggest using it at night, because it has a very sandy texture. I see this as a good thing, because it seems to smooth out the rough spots. Each morning my skin looks better and more glowing. I've been using it for a little more than a week. The only negative to the product is its smell, which is awful, perhaps because the company doesn't use fragrance, which could irritate the skin. Other than that I would buy it again, since it's very affordable.",5

I tried this on a whim and it works better for me than a product that's literally 10x the price. The formula is not elegant. it's a very watery serum that doesn't have the greatest smell. More than once I've knocked the open bottle and lost a bit of product, but at least it's incredibly affordable! I have dry, mature, slightly sensitive skin. I can't use glycolic acid without irritation, and I've found lactic acid is a great option for me because it's hydrating in addition to exfoliating.

It says you can use every day so that's what I did but I realized doing that, it destroyed my skin barrier. So I healed my skin barrier and used this just once at night (and not use my adap. that night). And again, my face broke out and I had oily clogged pores.

You get a lot of good product for a very reasonable price. Secondly, your skin will purge at first and get a little irritated and red (I have sensitive skin). However, with continued use: your fines lines are less visible, your pores are absolutely cleared OUT - no dark spots even with sebaceous filaments, your skin GLOWS. I cleanse nightly with an oil cleanser (oil dissolves oil), then a clay or salicylic acid cleanser to reduce pore size. I then apply this product under a good moisturizer. It is very watery, so be careful where you apply because it runs. Rub it in really well for best results, really get it in there before you apply moisturizer. I am very impressed, and I spent 1/10th of what I expected to see these results. Switched almost completely to this brand, have not had a bad experience with any product.",4.3

This is an acid so don't use it with other acids or retinol because it could be too harsh for your skin. I had no problems with using it full strength right away. I only apply at night and use SPF in the morning.,5

I only use this once a day at nighttime combined with the Ordinary's skin barrier serum and salacylic acid serum for the daytime. Ive never found anything thats able to do what this product has done for my skin. With these 3 products, my skin has completely been renewed and I hope this never gets discontinued!",5

The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"Definitely helps eliminate redness & evens my skin tone. I keep mine in the fridge, not sure if you're supposed to, but i think it being cold helps with my skin. I noticed a difference after 2 days. I apply it every morning & it lasts about 2 months for me",4.2
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I've been using this serum for a few weeks, and it's fantastic! My skin looks brighter, more even-toned, and feels great. It absorbs quickly and layers well with other products. A great, affordable option for a vitamin C boost!",5
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I mean it's affordable it's just too strong for my 54 year old Latino combination post menopause skin. I wish I could use this affordable reputable product however I am sticking with cosrx thanks to Laura sales associate at elmwood location in harahan Louisiana… she's awesome she tested recommended products on my skin… it sunscreen, Clinique moisturizer, Cosrx too.. very happy with level of customer service",2

The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,I've tried many different vitamin c serums and this is definitely one of my tops ones! I'd say it compares to the vichy vitamin c and this one is cheaper. definitely prefer this over la Roche posay's vitamin c.,5
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I love this product and can really see the difference it has made to my hyperpigmentation. However, I find it impossible to finish a bottle within the 6 months usage period, even though I use a generous amount twice a day, which seems terribly wasteful. Surely it would be better to produce a smaller sized bottle or increase the stability of the product so that it lasts longer than 6 months? Not a complaint, just a suggestion :-)",2
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,It's hard to find in stores so I constantly am praying that they keep making it.,3

The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I have been using Ascorbyl Glucoside for a couple of months on the back of my hands and it has really made a difference to the age spots I've had for years. They haven't gone but they are so much lighter. It does dry slightly shiny, but I then use moisturiser and it's fine. A brilliant product.",4.2
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"The product itself seems to work well for my skin (Dry-sensitive), leaving it smooth and glassy, which a reduction in the appearance of sunspots. HOWEVER, be careful using this at night/bed time. It has left black bleach marks all over my white pillowcases and sheets from it rubbing off my face onto the fabric. I can confirm this also happened to another pair of sheets at a hotel I was staying at, where I was using the product.",5
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I was starting to show light age spots on my hands and arms. After repeated use and less than two months the spots are gone. I use it right after I shower, let it dry and had moisturizer or you end up with a slightly sticky skin and then shiny/cakey. Highly recommend!",2
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I've never written a review, yet here I am. This stuff has transformed my skin. I read that combining this form of vitamin C with Niacinamide does wonderful things. I have SUPER sensitive and acne prone skin (in my 60s!!). Within 3 days (no joke), my skin looked brighter and plumper. Since I started using this (over a month now), I have had zero (ZERO!) acne. I hope it continues and my skin won't ""adjust"" to its old, former self. WOW, just WOW. I find it feels oily even though it states it is water based, so I put the niacinamide on first, then this, then my spf moisturizer. Did I say WOW?!!!",5
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,Not good for my skin as it triggered my dermatitis and also make my skin itchy and bumpy,2
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I am very low maintenance with my skincare but have benefited from a Vit C derivative, I do find I'm lovely and bright looking afterwards but I'm really not keen on the texture afterwards, it's quite tacky and taut, so great if you want that skin-tightening feel but it's not my favourite texture, I feel maybe a moisturiser like HA could be added in the formula... May start doing this myself tbh. But overall not a bad buy, just be aware if you have sensory icks & aversions.",4.2
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and it has improved my complexion. It's just given me a little more glow, I can now tell my skin was just a little dull looking before. I will definitely keep using",5
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I use tretinoin for acne and anti-aging and if you're also using tret you're aware of how other skincare products don't always play nice with it. My experience with The Ordinary's Pycnogenol was a disaster and I wonder why I ever strayed from this. It's gentle on the skin, helps with sun damage and hyperpigmentation, and pairs well with Tretinoin. Unlike l-ascorbic acid serums its also very stable and DOESN'T SMELL. Every L-AA serum I've used smelled weird, like hot dog water (it isn't just the ferulic acid often incorporated into it). I just CANT deal with the hot dog water smell and this thankfully has no scent.",2
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I have tried so many Vitamin C (LAA and Ascorbic Acid) but always stings and burn anything that is above 10% until the day i found The Ordinary Absorbyl Glucoside. At first application it does feel tacky but not when u wait few minutes for it to absorb, i have a very dry super sensitive skin from long term usage of tropical steroid cream and ended up with a very thin layer on my face at age 38. My face glows every morning since i use it day and night from using it for about a month. You may not like it because it's not LAA or AA but this serum did manage to keep my skin happy, glowy and non irritant. Would love to purchase it again once the bottle finish. Thank you for making me feel much more confident with myself.",3
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,This quickly became one of my holy grail skincare items! Within a few weeks of using I noticed my dark spots fading (and I had a good number of them due to acen) and my friends were commenting on how dewey and glowing my skin was looking. I apply every morning after a hyaluronic toner and right before my moisturizer. I have had no issues with lack of absorption or pilling. 10/10!,5
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"This one is by far my favorite Ordinary product. I'm in my 30s and have combination skin (mostly dull and dry, but sometimes oily) that likes to break out from pretty much anything. I use this product with the HA moisturizer and not only it does not break me out- any breakouts from other products somehow heal faster. And my face doesn't look like i'm stuck in a never-ending hangover when I wake up in the morning. I've tried Buffet and Copper Peptide serums before and Ascorbyl Glucoside wins.",4.2
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I've been using this for about a year and was pretty pleased with the results until I started a new bottle. I've spent the past year building up how often I apply it, from once a week all the way to 5 times a week and it's just not comfortable any more. I have extremely dry skin and ever since I started the new bottle a week ago my skin has felt dry, itchy and tight. Maybe the ingredients have changed? Or the manufacturing process? Whatever it is I'm hesitant to keep using it. I'm going back to once a week and will see what happens.",5
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I have tried this product off and on whilst looking for a regime for my sensitive / oily / acne / rosacea prone skin. I am a pale caucasian 28 year old female and this product does not irritate my skin and leaves my face glowing and looking hydrated. I use it at night under azelaic acid. I am yet to try it under my supergoop mineral spf and under makeup. I just wish there was more scientific evidence on the effects of anti aging (wrinkling and fine lines) Anyway, good luck out there everyone!! Xx",2
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"Texture is easy to spread. No scent, not sticky after feel. My moisturizer SPF lotions spreads smoothly.

The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,I've been using this product consistently for the past year and have really noticed a reduction in my skin's hyperpigmentation from acne scarring. I can't use traditional vitamin c products due to sensitivity and perioral dermatitis but this is the only product my skin absolutely loves! I think it works amazing as a vitamin c for those with sensitive skin.,5
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I bought this product a few months ago after switching from the 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder. I switched to the Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% as it is an indirect Vitamin C product which allowed me to combine it with a lot of other products. I have definitely noticed my skin becoming clearer in terms of texture and become more radiant, less dull. I will continue to use this product. If you have oily or normal skin, I would recommend this product. If you have dry skin like my fiance, I would recommend the Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution 20% in Vitamin F. Please remember you can't use this with Niacinamide products.",2
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"The product gives an instant glow thanks to a layer of shine. I don't know how to describe it, so I put a picture of my hand, where you can see the edges of the product. The product ist completely dry on the picture! I really like the shine even though I feel like it gets lost after I apply my moisturizer. Anyhow the layer might feel odd to some. Personally I don't mind it and the feeling also goes away after applying moisturizer",5
The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I'm using this product for more than 6 months now, and all I can say is that it really works! It makes my skin look bright and plumpe, and the hyperpigmentation is gone!",5

The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I wanted to like this so badly, but I should've listened to the reviews saying ""you get what you pay for."" The product does not go on smoothly, I personally didn't see any benefits after use, and it clumped upon application. I do LOVE The Ordinary, but this one just was not it. It didn't do any harm or aesthetic damage to my skin so I don't want to give it one star.",5

The Ordinary,Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,$14.80,"I've been trying different products from The Ordinary to brighten and even out my skin tone. I'm in my 50s with combination sensitive skin. This product caused a lot of redness and irritation on my upper cheeks. I didn't get to use more than two weeks. I tried to skip a day, and then use sparingly, but gave up as I was having to cover redness that I never had before, and it immediately went away when I stopped this. Disappointing and a waste of money. If you have sensitive skin be careful.",1

So far (1 week) it hasn't caused any breakouts, and my skin looks and feels good when I apply this. I def see a freshness in my skin tone and my pores appear smaller.

The Ordinary,100% Cold Pressed Virgin Marula Oil,$11.40,"Love this product and sadly spilled about half a bottle so am re-buying. It gives a great non-greasy shine to my very long, thick and dry hair, making the dry ends feel healthy. If I had short or fine hair I would only use this as a treatment i.e. before washing - you would still get oiliness at the root like any other hair oil. I also use it for facial massage and it feels so hydrating. It has a light but still oily feel. If you don't like oil textures, this may not be for you; if you do, this product is ideal. I've used every kind of pure oil under the sun on my face and this has the best texture. I've never broken out from using this product.",5

I use the dropper to drop a dime to nickel size of oil and rub my hands together; I then pat it evenly over my face and neck/decolletage. This oil is quickly absorbed and does not leave me oily; it works great under different kinds of makeup and other products. I would recommend and repurchase.",3

Anyway I am mot the most consistent with my skincare but this cleanser doesnt dry me out, creamy cleansers are recommended for people with fry and sensitive skin so I had a feeling it would be okay on me.

The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,Made my face breakout . I havr combination skin and i never have acne. I get one little period bump once a month in the same place. Once o started using this product i started getting acne in the places i applied the serum. I stopped using it. Its also pretty geavy,5
The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,"This product is horrible. It appears to have changed its formula and is very harsh on your skin. Do not use if you have even slighly sensitive skin. I used just a very little and woke up with extremely swollen face and eyes, and itching and burning face.",3.8
The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,"I've used this product about two years ago and I never broke out. I started getting closed comedomes a year ago due to the summer heat so I used Benzyol Peroxide to help clear out my skin, it helped but but it lead to purging, redness and scars. I have closed comedomes again this year so instead of using Benzoyl Peroxide again, I'm going to use this product again to even my skin texture without purging. I've been using it for 3 days straight. I recommend to do a patch test for a week straight and to not use daily but a day yes and a day no to prevent damaging your skin barrier due to not being able to handle it. Only use once per day that you're going to use it if you're starting!!!!💗💗",5
The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,"i accidentally bought this product meaning to by the other salicylic acid serum and i used it for a while not knowing it was the cause of my new skin issues, after realizing that this was the problem, i stopped using it and my skin started clearing up within the nect couple of days",1

The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,this made my skin so much worse I was trying so hard to like it. I just want clear skin and it created a even bigger issue.,5
The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,I picked up this product because I know salysilic acid is good for acne pimples texture ect I was scared because of the reviews but this product worked really good for me and made my acne and pimples reduce over the first week of use i didn't really smell anything from the serum like people said and if you want something that won't purge your skin but will work id get this,3.8
The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,"Ive used a couple products from the ordinary and I accidentally bought this one. I figured since I have really dry skin that this could work. I can get past the smell but my face broke out the first time I used it, then tried it again to make sure it was that particular product breaking me out. If you have acne problems, I do not reccomend.",5
The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,"To each their own but personally, the smell was horrendous! I used it once and that was enough for me to want to return this product. If you're sensitive to smells, I would not recommend this product.",1
The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,"I had really high hopes for this product and thus I am really disappointed. I am 16 and Ive never really struggled with acne in particular. Ive been getting lots of bumpy texture and closed comedones on my face, also experiencing some singular pimples here and there, these happened probably due to me adding into my routine a moisturizer that was too heavy for my skin. These pimples however werent really inflamed or hurt. I decided to try The Ordinary's serum because I saw someone say it saved their skin. So since my skin has been experiencing some problems I hoped this serum would solve them. Ive Heard about ""the purging phase"" and that this product will most probably cause it. I started using it about 3 weeks ago, and I did, in fact get lots of new pimples. They were inflamed, they hurt and they wouldnt go away. I also experienced some under-skin ones, i don't know what theyre called, but just they don't have anything ""poppable"" they just hurt and are swollen. And to this day i kept telling myself its the purging phase and i have to just suck it up and keep going. But my skin has gotten so bad ive become insecure about it like ive never been before. I don't think that what i experienced is what the purging phase should look like. Today i decided to stop using this product because it just breaks me out. So sadly i cant recommend this product :(( i added a star because it did a great job at keeping my dry skin moisturized",5
The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,I have been using this for 3 days. I apply it at night. It does help clear up bkemishes. I'm 49 and still get them occasionally. It dried it up quickly. I purchased to help clear congested pores. The solution is in an oil base that goes on smoothly. My only complaint is the smell. It almost smells like the oil is rancid. Maybe I got a bad bottle? It smells like pencil shavings from a pencil sharpener. Weird.,1
The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,I love this product for my skincare routine of my face!,3.8
The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,"I almost didn't buy after reading some of these reviews. I can't complain about my skin too much but always had a bumpy forehead w closed comedones, and particularly my temples. So I was terrified of the ""purge"". I think y'all just using too much too fast. I tried 2 drops, one for my forehead and one on jawline etc 2-3x a week and after 3 months I'm having noticeable improvement. Probably best for ""mild"" treatment on sensitive skin given how I've used it without irritation or an ugly purge phase",5
The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,"Yes, the smell is not very pleasant; Yes, the texture feel oily, even though it is not an oil-based serum, yes it doesn't sink in, but I love this product. I have had horrible breakouts for a few years on my chin and jawline and this product, in combination with the classic Salicylic Acid 2% solution, really helped me. I don't have big and painful pimples like I used to. And when I have a pimple, it disappear in 3 days, and it is waaaay smaller than what I had before. I use this product on the morning, and the classi serum in the evening. It even helped me when I had a little bit of eczema under one of my eye. This product; for example, works way better than the niacinamide 10% for me :)",1
The Ordinary,Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,$7.50,I tried this for 3 weeks and it only made my acne so much worse. I was getting new huge pimples every single day even on my neck and I don't ever get pimples there. I thought maybe it's supposed to get worse before it gets better so I stuck with it for 3 weeks and it only got worse. I stopped using and my acne cleared up within a week of stopping.,4

The Ordinary,Marine Hyaluronic Moisture Lock Serum,$9.20,"I purchased this by mistake the first time-I was going for the regular hyaluronic which have a thicker consistency like most serums. This works great during those HOT HOT months!!! Yes, it's thin and watery which is a plus in the summer time. It absorbs QUICKLY! Those heavier serums don't compare when it's hot, humid and muggy outside.",3
The Ordinary,Marine Hyaluronic Moisture Lock Serum,$9.20,This is my second time purchasing this item as it has made a great impact in my regimen.

I am 30 years old but would have introduced this to my routine long ago!,4

I had only seen one review of someone with a shellfish allergy getting a reaction, but I thought what are the chances I would? Pretty high apparently. The Ordinary, PLEASE put a disclaimer on this product for those with seafood/shellfish allergies! Wish I could've liked this product, sad to return it but just glad my reaction didn't get too severe.",3

I prefer it over the regular Hyaluronic. Personally, I've had THEE best luck with all their products, but it's because I know my skin/sensitives etc and I researched SEVERAL sources before using, went slow, patch tested etc. I have ONLY positive to say about these products! I'm always checking to see if they will keep creating new things!",4.5

That being said, I also have a dry scalp and was desperately hoping this would work somehow, so I tried using it as an overnight treatment. I would put a good amount (1-2 full pipettes) of this serum in the night before and then wash my hair in the morning to get the hydrating effects.

When I switched to wavy hair products, I realized that my problem wasn't dandruff at all but dry scalp! This serum does reduce flakes when I use it consistently. The only downside is it's kind of annoying to apply because it soaks right in. Definitely requires more than ""a few drops"" per application.",2
The Ordinary,Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid Scalp Serum,$14.70,"I suffered with severe scalp pain during bleaching, followed by excessive flaking for few days after my salon visit. This serum has completely changed this. I use this to prep my scalp few hours before my salon appointment and again at bedtime. During bleaching, it seems to create a barrier between my scalp and the chemical which really has helped with the pain during the process. When used after my salon visit, it soothes my irritated scalp (feels equivalent to applying aloe after sunburn), which has prevented the excessive flaking post bleaching. It totally changed my life. I would highly recommend",5

While the serum helps my scalp psoriasis a bit, it leaves the hair absolutely soaked and does not dry, leaving your hair to look incredibly greasy even though it is freshly washed and dried.

Sadly, this goes in with all the other brightening products I've tried. It's too sticky, makes my sunscreen pill, and just made me break out all over again. I quit using after a week. Yes, I know some products cause cell turnover and that can cause breakouts temporarily, but in my experience, those breakouts never stopped even after weeks of using.

Noticeably brightened my skin with the added bonus of a low price point and one bottle lasting for ages. However, after having a baby, my skin became more sensitive, and this product couldn't do its job under those conditions. It took me a good 6 months to realize that I should change my skincare routine, and at that point, I saw that my skin was less irritated when I didn't use this product (the primary culprit, however, was over-exfoliation). I tried to re-introduce this product around a year after changing my skincare routine, but it didn't seem to have much effect. However, when I recently re-introduced it again (I now have melasma and it's driving me nuts!), I noticed that my skin was responding positively right away. So bottom line: this product is absolutely AMAZING, BUT your skin barrier must be healthy enough to benefit. If this product doesn't work for you, or you suddenly can't tolerate it after a long period of use, consider a gentler skincare regimen and then try re-introducing it later; it's definitely worth trying because my skin hasn't been as bright without this product.

I didn't realize at first that it was the product but it happened a second time when it affected both eyes / eye regions; the skin on both my eye lids and on my cheek bones felt chemically burnt, were red and swollen. The swelling went away by the end of the day but the scab from the burn and swollen skin took days to heal and come off. I think this might have happened because of the product expiring - I ordered it a year ago and didn't realize since it lasted quite long and was stored in the fridge.

The Ordinary,100% Niacinamide High-Potency Oil-Control Powder,$6.40,"Wondering how long this niacinamide powder is good for as I have an older jar that I keep using which seems to work just fine but I do remember that there was no expiry date on the packaging or on the jar itself. Compared to other products on The Ordinary website, it says how long the product if good for once opened but not for this one. This is already a powder in its purest form so you would think it last forever and ever lol I would love to know....",5

I have been through ao many products, from good molecules to dermalogica to curology to drunk elephant. But nothing has visibly changed my skin the wat this product does. I used to deal with bad flaking combined with oily spots, but my skin is so even now. No flakes. No super shiny spots. Just allover dewy and even. I use it twice a week, after i cleanse my face in the shower so my pores are more open. I leave it for 15 minutes instead of 10, and wipe it off with a textured cotton pad for extra exfoliation. I don't have super sensitive skin so this works well for me, and ive used it for 4 years now so i know how much my skin can stand. Obviously tread lightly if you are new to the product! Start with 5 minutes if it burns too much and work your way up. And yes. It's supposed to burn! It's not comfortable. So many reviews complaining about this, but thats how a chemical peel works. If you don't feel it, its not removing your dead skin. Make sure you moisturize IMMEDIATELY after! Your skin will be very tight and clean. You'll feel so glowy!
