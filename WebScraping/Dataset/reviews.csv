COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"I am someone who didn't use a toner in my skin-care routines but I wanted to give this a try since hearing so much about it. And I must say - Not disappointed at all! It is such a mild toner, it balances the ph of my skin since I apply it after washing my face. I have been using it since 2 weeks only at night. But I can see that my pores (don't have large pores on my skin, only few on the apple of my cheeks and some on the nose) have cleaned up, my blackheads have also reduced somewhat as well as whiteheads. Now I want to clarify that I am using other products as well on my skin - like Serum and Face Cream. But still I feel that the other products don't have anything in them to clear up the pores or blackheads so it could be credited to this toner. I spray some of it on my face since it comes with a spray-on and even though it's AHA-BHA the %age is very minimal, it is very mild (at least for my skin-type - Combination (Dry with Oily T-Zone
). It hasn't caused any breakout for me.",4,,

Cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad,"I have textural issues, so rly bad White and blackheads, followed up w some acne. I haven't been using this product very long but so far, I like the results. It smoothened out my skin, ESPECIALLY when I use the Dr. Jart+ cicapair derma cream solution cream. The appearance of my pores aren't as visible as before. And I'm very happy ab my skin. I personally like the smoother side better than the textural side Bc it feels like I'm scraping my skin since my skin is so badly textured and it feels a little harsh. Maybe when my skin is a little smoother, it'll glide on nicer. I rly reccomend this product! Only use 1-3 times a week tho Bc it does contain Salicylic acid and it could potentially dry out ur skin. Ppl say u can use this in place of toner but my face feels dry afterwards due to the bha I'm guessing ? But I follow up w my toner afterwards‚ò∫Ô∏èI'm not sure how many pads it contains but it's a LOT more thinner than I thought it would've been, so be careful and doubl check it you're getting one or actually 2..",4,,
Cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad,"I have normal-dry, sensitive skin. I've used this for 2+ weeks. Not only it exfoliates gently, it doesn't leave the skin feeling dry and stripped. My brother whose skin is more sensitive than mine felt slight stinging sensation, but it didn't on mine. It calms my irritated skin really fast. It helps prevent future break outs. My acne prone siblings have recognizably reduced their acne life span. It dries them out nicely with extra help from spot-treating with tea tree oil. I used it every other day, while my brother used it both morning and night. This is a keeper.",5,,
Cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad,"Cleans and refreshes my combination skin gently but effectively. Doesn't overly strip skin. I'm difficult to please and I'm really impressed. I plan to restock when I run low. Only con is the quality and size of the pads. Wish they were just a little bigger. Also my jar was in excellent condition and still is, pads very moist but I do worry if the pads might dry up over time so I am careful that lid is closed tightly. I highly recommend this to everyone with oily or combination skin!",5,,
Cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad,I have combination/oily skin and this has become a must-have for me. I use it in place of toner right after cleansing and always give it a minute to do its thing before I layer on a serum or essence. Love!,5,,
Cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad,"Really good, please offer the moisture pads also. thanks. amy",5,,
Cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad,"These pads clear the troubled skin. I use them on my back. I sweat a lot, so these pads clean my skin.",4,,
Cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad,I have been using this for a couple of days and it has really improved my skin! I have oily/acne prone skin and this product helps my skin a lot. I use this after my toner at night and in the morning i notice my skin looks less irritated.,5,,
Cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad,I love how this continues to help my skin feel clean and clear!,5,,
Cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad,Love it! It really help clear my skin. Highly recommended!,5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,"I'm in my 40s and get the occasional zit. These patches help SO much! Their edges are so thin, it's easy for them to stick to your skin and it almost looks like there isn't anything there. These are a staple in my skincare!",5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,These are the OG pimple patches (to me at least) and they work just as they‚Äôre supposed to! They work best on pimples closer to the surface and prevent you from messing with them while helping them heal faster.,5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,These work really well to dissipate pimples.,5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,"When I'm bothered by a pimple or when I can see the middle core I put them on and within the 8hrs it comes right out me! After it comes out I move on to cleansing and treating with aquaphor.
When on, it really helps stop me from touching it! Also helps the pimple stay minimzed, and does block me from touching it when it gets a bit itchy.
I do have a fresher newer pimple, it has minimized in size & calmed redness but not cleared it up. After the 8hrs I cleanse use heat & cold compress (Right now im unsure if its a pimple or boil) when i start seeing the middle I'll definitely put on another patch.
Theyre pretty discreet until it soaks up the oils.",5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,"I think these patches work as well as most other patches. It does get rid of the pimples at white head, or bring the head to the surface so it can be extracted so that's good! But I've used many other patches which work the same if not better and are cheaper with 42 patches so not worth it to me. Glad i tried them though.",3,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,They are pretty effective in my acnes and I like they have different sizes so I can use them on different locations even hair lines,5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,Much thinner than the night time patches and almost invisible. I feel like the pimples never get much bigger after I start using the patch.,5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,I love it üòç,5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,I really like these the blend in very well and it keeps me from touching my breakouts.,5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,"I love how invisible they are to the site. I totally recommend them to everyone who has prone acne ommend them to everyone, who has acne prone skin or has hormonal acne! There is no reason for not loving how amazingly they actually work. It definitely helps you out, when you get the feeling of popping out the pimple which can cause a lot of damage to your skin!",5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,"To be quite frank, I don't think I've ever noticed any ""immediate relief"" (after 24 hours) using the patch but honestly it does the job by providing physical barrier from the outside. It stays on really well!",4,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,These patches are amazing! Better than the originals because they are thinner and easier to use during the daytime if you‚Äôre lounging at home. I try to always have a pack on hand because they do sick a great job at protecting my skin and extracting hunk from blemishes.,5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,"These work wonders for hormonal acne- the deep, painful kind that take forever (if at all) to surface. These patches practically disappear on your skin and make your most stubborn spots disappear too! I will definitely be repurchasing.",5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,It didn‚Äôt work that well for me but I think it‚Äôs a great product,3,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,"I love them because they are discreet, I can use them for work, and it not only helps my pimples to be smaller but also prevents me to touch them and therefore they disappear faster <3 Super in love",5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,These work so well. I love the original version for overnight treatment. Now I have these for daytime treatment--they are so thin and discreet. I recommend these to everyone.,5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,These reduce pimples overnight. It's absolutely amazing. I'll never not have these in my skincare cupboard.,5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,These are so much more thin and transparent than the Acne Pimple Master Patches and they work just as well!,5,,
Cosrx Clear Fit Master Patch,What?! they are so freakin awesome! I will be stocking up. They work!,5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,It‚Äôs good,5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,This exfoliator is EVERYTHING! I can literally feel it working on my face. It makes it feel so smooth and clean after each use. It will definitely be a must for my nighttime skincare routine ‚ú®Ô∏è,5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,Everytime I use this product I get a face full of small bumps. I've tried it twice because so many people swear by this.,1,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"I love this product. I rely on this toner to deep clean my pores. During summer months in the East Coast, humidity opens my pores and the disgusting dirty air fills in... Get the picture... I don't like to see black dots around my nose and chin. This Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid works! I don't recommend using this at daytime, only use at night. I also use this on my body where I sometimes get body acne.",5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,I used it only once and it gave me a sunburn into my skin. I did not see any effect besides the irritation and peeling off.,1,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,I‚Äôve been using the product for three weeks. No change whatsoever,1,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"If you have sensitive skin this is a good thing to use if your face reacts quickly to BHA. It is gentle enough to use multiple time a week, but don't use it every night or twice a day. I experienced peeling around my nose. While using it only 3 times a week I have noticed fewer black and white heads. My pores are visibly smaller (but not gone cause that is a genetic characteristic) and not congested either.",4,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"I‚Äôve had blackheads on my nose since my teen years. I‚Äôve tried multiple products Over the years to rid my skin of them with minimal success . This Corsrx product actually works. Since using it I‚Äôve seen dramatic improvements. I still have some tiny blackheads, but they are much smaller and less visible. I see an improvement in skin texture too. I‚Äôve only been using this product a few weeks. I‚Äôm hopeful with continued use blackheads will no longer be an issue for me. Best blackhead treatment I‚Äôve ever used. The consistency is slightly heavier than water and slightly oily. It does not burn or irritate my skin whatsoever. So, I‚Äôve been using daily rather than once or twice a week per directions. I‚Äôm not sure if this is a good idea, but I just love how effective it is, and can‚Äôt help myself from putting it on my nose each day.",5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"Years ago, Cosrx stopped making this stuff because of the contents and a change in korean drug laws. I was very sad. But I recently found this site, and realozed that Cosrx went back to making this product so I bought 2 bottles immediately. This stuff is amazing.",5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,I‚Äôve only used it about three times so far and followed the directions to use it once a week at first and I can already see a difference in my skin. My pores look smaller and I have visibly less blackheads. My skin‚Äôs overall complexion looks much smoother as well!,5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"so I don't think it's been a life changer for me but it's definitely more powerful at eliminating blackheads than any other product I've used! I still have some stubborn blackheads on my nose though that aren't going away, but perhaps you have to use it multiple times before seeing all the results.",5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"For starters I adore Ohlolly seriously everything on this site is curated and the owners stand by it so you cant‚Äôt go wrong with whatever you choose. I had tried weekly 2% BHA treatments in the past and find that a lower concentration more often does more for my skin. My skin is glowing, pores are smaller and my blackheads are reduced.",5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"I followed the instructions, and after using it the second time after a week, my blackheads on my nose are gone! Needs a very small amount.",5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"I no longer have severe acne, but I switched to BHA because I have issues with blackheads and clogged-large pores. I do think this has helped. I was using the AHA exfoliatior before this one. The BHA did cause me to break out because my skin was going through a ""purging"" stage. After a month of adjustment, the acne resided and my skin healed pretty well. The product is good just be aware that it may cause your skin to flare up.",5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"This is the best skincare product I have ever used. Period. I have written rave reviews for a few other products on this site because Korean beauty literally changed my life, but this one specifically knocked me right off my feet. Literally the first night that I used it, all of the acne on my face that was in the process of healing was completely flat. Like this stuff made my skin skip a week of healing overnight. Absolutely insane. Over the course of a week, every single blackhead on my face was completely dissolved and erased. I have had hormonal cystic acne plus T-zone blackheads for over 10 years, and this product cured it all in one week. This product is straight up a miracle. I will never stop using it as long as I love and its still made.",5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"I switched to this from the harsh exfoliating pads my dermatologist recommended after they started itching/burning and I couldn't be happier. I also prefer this to the Paula's Choice 2% BHA. Although I've only tried a few, this is my favorite exfoliant! I use it two to three mornings a week directly after washing and wait about 25 minutes to apply my sunscreen moisturizer so that my skin's pH can renormalize. I've had a little purging but nothing too crazy. Over all I'm a very happy camper.",5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,I think it‚Äôs really helping! I will order again!,5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,This product is honestly the single most important part of my skin care routine. It cleared my skin so effectively and gently (I had tons of breakouts on my forehead and cheeks) I use this product in conjunction with the AHA 7 from CosRx and my breakouts reduced within three days and are now completely gone. 100% worth the money. I would honestly pay five times the amount for this product.,5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,I‚Äôve been using this for a few weeks and I swear it looks like my blackheads are slowly melting away. This product is gentle and surprisingly works!,5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"I had already been using a different bha before I started this one, so I can't really vouch for it's ability to unclog pores. But I *can* say that my pores didn't get worse when I made the switch to this brand of bha, despite it being gentler than the other brand. I also really like that this bha gets absorbed into my skin super fast, and I appreciate not having to wait around forever for it to sink in.",4,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,I have always struggled with tiny blackheads on my nose and this product as cleared them right up while improving the overall quality of my skin. I normally have sensitive skin and was scared to try BHA but I had no issues with this product. I started using it twice a week and now use it every other day.,5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,I have had black heads on my chin and nose for 12 years (since I was 14). Literally overnight my blackheads were reduced. I could physically feel them being more flush with my skin and more cleaned out when I touched my face. I have super sensitive skin (rosacea and eczema among other things) and I have not had flare ups or break outs since using it. I haven't found my skin being irritated by the BHA. My skin feels smooth and moisturized after each use. I have been using this stuff for about two weeks and I'm already experiencing the clearest skin of my adult life. Pure magic in a bottle.,5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"This is a high-quality BHA, which from my experience is on par with (if not superior to) the Paula's choice BHA in terms of efficacy. The anti-inflammatory properties are fantastic, as I have already used it to spot-treat some pesky nodulocystic acne on my chin. It definitely sped the process of healing along, and even stopped the progression of one in its tracks; however, I am now left with peeling/flaking of my skin in those areas. I, like some of the other reviewers, have also tried using this as part of the fifty shades of snail/Liah Yoo method for reducing the appearance of sebaceous filaments... with minimal results, but that is probably because I am less prone to comedonal acne and sebaceous filaments than I was in my early 20s. This method may work better for people who have that gritty/sandpapery type of non-inflammatory acne. All in all, I will probably purchase again since it is an affordable and effective spot treatment for my skin type.",4,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"I've been on the hunt for the best product that. claims to help pimples and breakouts and I find this one to be the best at calming and helping the recovering process. Plus, it's really hydrating as well. Which is a plus. :)",5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,4,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"this stuff actually works. i love how its very easy to apply, i dont need a cotton round. minimizes the amount of blackheads, and makes them so much easier to extract.",5,,
Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid,"I was not expecting much from this liquid: watery thin AND responsibly priced? Yeah right like this was going to get rid of the little terrors on the end of my nose. But I followed the fifty shades of snails and Liah Yoo tutorials on getting rid of blackheads using this liquid, and it worked! I have only had this product for a few weeks now, and almost all of the evil beings are gone. I have sensitive skin, so I only use this about 2x a week with a skin lab clay mask. If you can stand more activity on your nose and other pores, you could potentially see an improvement faster.",5,,

And even if you don‚Äôt like how it dries on, it doesn‚Äôt matter because it actually works.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,a have used it for a while only. it hydrate my skin. I have been using it at night more since I heard it has glaicolic acid,4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have not used it for a long time. But for a short time of usage, I could not understand the hype. It is sticky and my skin does not absorbs it completely. I checked if it will help my acne scars to heal but nothing happened. I think i prefer hada labo premium.",4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I really love this product. it‚Äôs very moisturizing and doesn‚Äôt make me break out!,4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is very similar to a hyaluronic acid but it's a bit thicker and more moisturising. It's good, but you have to seal it in with a moisturiser.",4,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Mi trovo molto bene con questo siero/essence, avendo la pelle secca anche d‚Äôestate trovo che me la idrati e me la rimpolpi un sacco. Lo applico sui rossori del viso e li attenua. Non brucia gli occhi, √® appiccicoso s√¨ ma una volta spalmato sul viso l‚Äôeffetto diminuisce di molto se non scompare addirittura. Adatto a pelli sensibili, lo prender√≤ di nuovo appena mi finisce!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Sin duda estoy muy feliz por mi pedido, llego en menos de un mes a Peru todo s√∫per bien y los productos me encantan siento mi piel s√∫per linda los llevo usando unos cuantos d√≠as y si veo cambios en mi piel, la textura y mucho m√°s iluminada.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I was nervous about this product at first, since there was people online who have said that they have broken out after this product. But after using this product, I must say, the feeling on the skin already feels so hydrating. Just make sure to dampen the skin before applying to give better results! I have combination sensitive skin, and this product works wonders.",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This snail mucin is actually working on my skin. After two months using it everyday on the day and night I see results, my skin before had a lot of small scars because of the pimples that burst and these scars in two years didn't disappear but now is incredible.
Also the snail mucin at first sight seems to be watering texture but while you're putting on you feel the texture is changing and finally when dries (after 5 minutes approx) the texture is soooo smooth and I could say that even feels velvet, is so amazing!

TLDR: works well, feels great, good amount of product!",5,,

i have combination, textured skin and have repurchased this 3 times now.
i love this product so much and pair it with the hadalabo gokujun hyaluronic lotion, using water in between the two. this makes my skin SOOO glowy i‚Äôve noticed this two weeks after using these two together twice a day. i‚Äôd say this product is amazing for hydration but have not noticed a difference in brightening hyperpigmentation/dark spots or smoothing out the texture of my skin",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"ya voy por la segunda y claramente comprare una 3, es muy c√≥moda a penas la aplica se siente una comodidad incre√≠ble y para que vamos a hablar del glow inmediato que da, aun que es incre√≠ble igual recomiendo se use con agua termal o alg√∫n tonico ( eso igual lo recomienda la marca ) aun que no parezca hace una gran diferencia, solo es bueno pero con tonico es incre√≠ble. mi piel es mixta con tendencia al acn√© super sensible y nunca tuve ninguna molestia 100% recomendado",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have struggled with healing my skin barrier and hormonal acne. The snail Mucin hydrates my skin without the heaviness that I have felt with products like Hylauronic acid or heavy creams. I also experienced no irritation when i began to use it.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,its amazing for keeping your skin hydrated but for me i had to stop using it sadly after my perioral dermatitis started flaring which sucks since i love it so much. i used most of the bottle with no issues and i have very sensitive combination skin,4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I always use this at night because the texture makes it feel a bit too heavy in the morning. It's a staple in my routine and I normally only use 2-3 pumps per use, normally 2 is enough.",4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,it‚Äôs okay and it hydrated but i‚Äôm not a fan of the texture and i think there‚Äôs better hydration that‚Äôs longer lasting,3,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"This is my third bottle, I use this every day at night (a lighter one in the morning) since it does dry my skin a bit (combo skin). But my skin feels really clean after and I do notice a difference w my acne and acne scars, they kinda fade away with this cleanser. Will buy again.",5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,I was soo amazed with my skin the best facial wash I ever have,5,,

Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"This cleanser makes your skin feel so clean and new after using it. Also a very amazing one for people with oily skin, definitely a recommendation.",5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,Cleanser is very refreshing and doesn't tuck on my skin. After using it for a while I do see a difference with less acne and less flakiness. For me it's a perfect product to double cleanse with.,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,I was very surprised. It's perfect for my sensitive skin. Don't dry the skin. Very nice to apply. I'm very happy with it,5,,

Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,My second favorite cleanser from Cosrx! After I clean my face feels very fresh and refreshing and most important it doesn't dry my skin,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"I'm using this cleanser daily and have noticed that my skin is less flaky in the dry areas of my face. It removes all the left over gunk after removing make-up as well. I have combination skin. Make sure to follow through with the other skincare steps after usage though, because it can dry out your skin a little.",5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,I use this one almost daily. It‚Äôs definitely my favourite. It does dry my skin out slightly if I use it too much. (I have combination skin),5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,Amazing product. Really works wonders on the skin.,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,I have not been using it for a long time but this cleanser is so gentle for your skin. I have a combination skin and it doesn't dry my skin but leaves it clean and refreshed! Would certainly recommend,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,I have a very sensitive skin but this cleanser doesn't make my skin red or irritated. I've had this cleanser a few times and would still return to it.,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,I have been using this cleanser for years now and my skin got overall better. Keep in mind that your skin might need to get used to the acids in the beginning but it does a great job clearing the skin and provides a clean canvas for the next skin care steps!,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"For a combined skin, what I have. This is the best cleanser I ever used :)",5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"I got two bottles when they were part of the $1 sale! I trust CosRX and still use this once or twice a week. But it does remind me of old school 90s products I used as a teen because it‚Äôs so lemony, stringent and oil stripping. It foams up spectacularly tho using very, very little so it lasts forever. And it really gives you that extra squeaky clean feel WHEN you want it! üßº Just hydrate your skin after. It‚Äôs a trusty salicylic acid product, but def not a ‚Äúgentle daily‚Äù face wash. My partner uses it on his KP arms in the shower as well so it‚Äôs great for that or body acne where your skin is hardier.",4,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,I used this 2x a day on my face at first and got chemical burns. I've learned my lesson and now only use on my face 2-3x per week. I do use it as a body wash. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.,4,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,This is the best facial cleanser for me and my husband. We‚Äôve been using this for almost a year now and we loved it!,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,Strong scent but it did reduce oiliness after cleansing.,4,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,Favorite cleanser! I use this thrice a week,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"i really really hate the smell of this it‚Äôs so overwhelming you can‚Äôt even ignore it‚Äôs smells like lemons and baking soda and fireworks??üò≠
honestly i haven‚Äôt used it enough to say if it actually works just cause the smell is too much for me but the juminso pore rest cleanser is really good, it‚Äôs a similar price and would give similar results to what this claims to do. overall i wouldn‚Äôt recommend this cleanser",3,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"Got this for a teen with acne problem (occasional break outs) hoping that it will help keep his acne under control. Unfortunately, it was very harsh and he felt it stripped the moisture off his skin and made his acne worse. It may work for others with acne problem but beware that it may dry your skin too much.",2,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,Amazingggg foaming!!,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,Love it,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,I double cleanse in the morning and at night. This is my 2nd part cleanser. I absolutely LOVE how clean this makes my skin look and feel. I have very oily skin but I use this along with the same brand's Essence and All over cream and my oil isn't completely gone but it's definitely helped it alot. My skin texture is completely different and I get way less oily. I will definitely continue using this.,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"One thing I appreciated about this product is that it is not scented, which is a significant plus for me. However, I must admit that I'm hesitant to give it a 5-star review. In the past, I've noticed that when I leave 5-star reviews, this company tends to increase their prices, which is not ideal. Additionally, while this face wash is effective, I don't think it necessarily delivers life-altering results that would warrant a 5-star rating. Nonetheless, I would still recommend this product to others looking for a solid, unscented face wash.",3,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,I do like this cleanser because I have really oily skin but it can be harsh on my skin at times. I wash my face and then rinse it off really fast because if it sits too long the skin on my nose will get dry and flaky.,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"I wanted to like this cleanser because the foam a lot like a lot. And I wanted a salicylic acid face wash to clean up my acne, but I just found this one to be a little bit harsh and it never really did anything because I still had a lot of acne and pores. But I just think it‚Äôs just too harsh. I would pass on this.",3,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"Got this for a teen who needed to start a regular routine, and so far no complaints. I know Cosrx cleansers can be a bit drying, but I think it‚Äôs not the worst option to dip your toes into the world of Korean skincare.",4,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,I heard this was for oily skin after getting it sadly it didn‚Äôt work for me,2,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,I love cosrx products,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,I think it can be too harsh so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend you to get this one if you a looking for a salicylic acid cleanser,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,I think it can be too harsh for some people so I personally wouldn‚Äôt recommend you to buy this one if you are looking for d salicylic acid cleanser,3,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,So good,4,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"Love it ‚ô°, Blooming koco never fails to make me happy when receiving my packages.",5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,Uno de los mejores limpiadores que he usado.,5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"I had tried this cleanser before and decided to buy it again it is very good, it helps me a lot with my oily skin.",5,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"I was surprised to see the quality of this product for such a reasonable price! I just need a teeny tiny amount (literally a pinch) and the lather is unbelievable. My face feels clean, however, it also feels very dry. After using it for a while, my skin barrier got damaged. I stopped using it ever since. I now use it on my body during shower. It affects my body less than the face and neck.
It has a smell of rice water. So, whoever doesn't like any smell on skincare products, might find it uncomfortable.",2,,
Cosrx Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"I didn‚Äôt know to feel about this one. I was a bit skeptical about putting it on my face because of the strong lemon/citrus smell, BUT it didn‚Äôt irritate my face. It was great for removing the rest of my makeup after using a cleansing balm. I have oily skin also and acne prone but I haven‚Äôt noticed anything magical yet other than having a less shiny nose and forehead.",5,,

After I use this cleaner my face feels fresh, soft and moisturized!!",5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,I use this cleanser in my morning routine since it balances the ph level and it doesn't dry out my skin. The amount that I use sometimes doesn't seem like the amount on my face because it doesn't bubble that much but that might be just my preference.,5,,

Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"Not a bad morning cleanser, though I don't think I'll be purchasing again. It leaves my skin feeling clean and is gentle enough, but I think products with low pH don't do enough for my skincare needs.",3,,

Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,This is the best!! It makes my skin feel really clean. I have very sensitive skin and this has been so gentle and effective to start my skincare journey.,5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"This is my favorite cleanser, and I've tried a bunch. The tea tree scent is pleasant but not overwhelming, and the consistency is a smooth, clear gel.

Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,Cosrx Low PH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"This is my go to water based cleanser to use after my oil cleanser. I'll keep using it as long as they make it!

Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,Feel great on my skin. my skin feels clean fresh in the morning not dry,5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"My husband needed a new cleanser so I bought him many options to see which one fit him best, this is by far his absolute fav!",5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"I have had trouble finding a second cleanser that doesn't dry out my combination skin in the winter. This one is the winner! After I use it, my face feels nice and clean and not stripped and tight. It smells like tea tree oil, too, which I like. I live in a dry, cold climate, so I only use it in the evening after my oil cleanser. When I use it twice a day, my skin feels too dry (I just splash my face with water in the morning). However, when I was visiting family in a more humid climate, I did use it twice a day, and my skin didn't feel dry at all.",5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,Great morning cleanser. It makes my face feel sooooo soft!,5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,Cosrx Low PH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,4,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"This cleanser works really well for my skin. In the past two years, my acne has progressively gotten worse, yet this cleanser has been able to exfoliate my skin. It's helped smooth my complexion, and sped the process of healing from acne. It is not abrasive, however it is a powerful product. (It smells pretty strongly of plant extract.) It does cause a good amount of exfoliation, so be prepared with a gentle, and hydrating essence with moisturizer.",5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,Nice gentle cleanser. Smells a little like dirt.,4,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,I love it. I use it as my second cleansing at night. I find it my be too drying for my skin to use twice daily. My main skin goal is to clean congested pores. I don''t know if this cleanser is helping with that specifically ( may be too soon to tell) but my face is much brighter and more even skin tone with less acne scar color.,4,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"I can see how this would be a great cleanser for people with oily, normal, or combo skin. However if your skin is dry, sensitive, or you have a damaged skin barrier, you're going to want to skip this one. It left my skin feeling dry and tight, it was much too stripping of what little moisture my skin has, as a result my 2 week use of this cleanser has undone some of the hard work I have put into restoring my skin's flimsy epidermis and some of the symptoms of a damaged skin barrier which I've worked so hard to heal have come back; dry skin flakes that rub off when i apply oils to my face, stinging sensation while applying products, and multiple blemishes!!! If you don't have my skin type or a damaged skin barrier this will probably be just fine for you but for sensitive people it does not make the cut! Save yourself the trouble, learn from my mistake, and skip this one!",3,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"Gentle, smells nice, does not leave my skin feeling tight after cleansing.",5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"I really love this cleanser. It's a nice, cooling gel and has a wonderfully woodsy scent. Also, it doesn't leave my dry skin feeling tight and stripped of moisture. Definitely purchasing this one again.",5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"I've always been very sensitive to cleansers. They'd either leave me enflamed or super dry, like the product was stripping more than the oil on my skin. THIS is the best. It's super gentle, non-irritating, and soooooo soothing. This is my first time using Korean skincare and have been using about 4 other products from this site with this one. My skin is so soft. I never knew it could feel so soft. My skin is noticeably clearer and less red. I think I owe a lot of that to this product, it's the perfect first step. It wakes me up without any stinging / tingling sensation. My skin doesn't feel stripped or dry after I rinse it off. Nothing about this makes my skin feel uncomfortable. It smells lightly of tea tree oil which is funny because I now see that's one of the ingredients, but it's not over-powering and eye-watering like raw tea tree oil. The scent is so nice but very subtle. And you can't beat the price, this is a steal. I WILL be buying again!",5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"This is my all time favorite cleanser. No matter how many other great cleansers I try, I always come back to this one. It makes my skin feel clean without making it feel dry or tight. My skin loves this stuff!",5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"I tried a sample of this stuff and fell in love with it. I had to buy it as soon as I ran out and f the samples. My skin really enjoys it, I‚Äôll never run out it again.",5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"This was my first experience with a low-pH foaming-ish/gel cleanser, and it is great. Used after an oil cleanser, it always gets any makeup or grime leftover. I tend to like the tea tree smell, but I suppose it might bother some. I have combination/sensitive skin for reference. This was also my choice for my teen daughter's first face cleanser. In my experience, CosRx products are excellent quality for the price.",5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,Great gentle cleanser - great for morning! It leaves my skins feeling refreshed and ready for my morning routine.,5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"I am liking the morning wash so far. Smells great, foams nice. My skin does feel quite dry and tight after using though.",4,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"Skin type: Dry Skin with acne scaring and mild break outs.
The low ph balance is noticably different than other cleanser that I have used. It respects the skin barrier without stripping my skin of the good natural oils. I use this as a second cleanser after my oil cleanser. I will definitely be repurchasing this product from Ohlolly. Delivery was fast and it came with a cute hand written note. I enjoy that Ohlolly has a strong attention to customer service and details. Thank you Ohlolly! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,LOVED this- exactly what my skin was looking for - it leaves me feeling clean like you wouldn‚Äôt believe!! A definite new fav of mine,5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,I use this cleaner every few days. It works wonderfully as a gently exfoliating body wash as well. I am currently on isotretinoin but still find this gentle enough to use a couple times a week.,5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,I have skin that breaks out easily but my skin type is normal to slightly dry. I did not think this cleanser would be this clarifying. My face feels so uncomfortably dry after. And the smell is too much for me. But I could see people with oily skin loving this. It's got some great ingredients in there so I do think it's a quality product. It has a really good lather for something with a low ph too. I just strongly recommend avoiding this if you have dry skin.,2,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,It's amazing. Get it! My skin is sensitive and acne-prone. I'm on my second bottle and will not be living without this product EVER.,5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"Age: 20's
Skin Type: Oily, Acne-Prone
*It has a light, herbal, tea tree scent.
*Does a great job of thoroughly cleaning the skin without over-stripping.
*Foams up in a satisfying way.
*Great Deal! I used it morning and night for over 6 months.
* Pairs really well with a cleansing balm.

Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"I am sure this is a wonderful product for most people. Unfortunately I had a horrible reaction to this product. I have very sensitive, cystic acne prone combination skin. Based on the reviews I thought that this would be a great cleanser to use in the morning. I was wrong. The first time I used the product I woke up the next day and had several cystic pimples in a cluster on my face and I was not positive that the cleanser with the cause so I for went using the product for about 2 weeks. After using the product a second time I had an even worse reaction. I would strongly recommend anyone with cystic acne to proceed with caution when using this product.",1,,

Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,I've been using this for about 3 months now and I've decided that this is definitely my go-to cleanser. It's gentle and it foams but not intensely so you're left with tight skin after washing and drying. This is ideal for oily and acne prone skin.,5,,

COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"Okay! Before and after pictures. I truly do love this product and it helped my skin so much. I used to have these bumps. I never went to the dermatologist or anything for my acne, I just assumed it was fungal acne... (haha) After a month of using this and using their good morning facial cleanser, black head clearing power liquid and snail essence... life changing. I did just use just the toner from corsx before I bought everything else because I saw results. But, using all of their products have literally sped up the clearing process! Also, I barely wear makeup too prob 1-2x a month to take photos in (lol). I feel so much more confident now! I do use some other products like the Sunday Riley CEO serum for my scarring and aveeno moisturizer. However, give this product and other corsx stuff a try! I have tried more expensive products and I find this is affordable for what it does as well. Just to note, I do have oily/combo skin and genetically large pores! :)",5,,

I have combination skin and although I only put it on my oily T-zone I guess I was not as oily as I thought, for it dried me out quiet a bit. I ended up giving it away and it worked well for the person I gave it to. So get it if you overproduce oil/sebum. It did not irritate my skin just made me dry is all.",4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,One of the most cost friendly toners for all kinds of skin,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"Very good product.
Nice combination of AHA and BHA and it is very gentle on the skin. I have used other products with AHA but could not continue them because they irritated my skin after only 2-3 days. I will definitely recommend this product.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,I like this !,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"My skin looks amazing now! It‚Äôs completely smooth, no more bumps. There used to be a few pimples but they just disappeared. And before, I used to pop my pimples in order for them to start going away. But I remember the day before i received this toner, I pimple grew on the side of my face. Then the morning after I used the toner, it was flat. Gone! I would like to note though that the toner wasn‚Äôt the only thing i added to my new daily skin routine. I also started using the cosrx snail mucin with it.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Best toner ever for my 20s,5,,

COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"I use this product for back acne and chest acne, and it works amazing. Obviously it‚Äôs a toner so you dont want to use it every day, but every second day works well It‚Äôs cleared up my back so nicely! If you dont want to get it off Amazon, Walmart has them for fairly cheap as well",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"This is the first time I‚Äôm doing my skincare routine with active ingredients for chemical exfoliation. I used to do physical exfoliation with a scrub which, overtime, damaged my sensitive skin and irritated the heck out of it. I‚Äôve been watching skincare advice videos and many recommended kbeauty skincare products so I decided to try this product as my exfoliator.
Wow, I didn‚Äôt expect much because I read that this is a very mild AHA/BHA product that can be used daily but I‚Äôm impressed. I had bad breakouts on my forehead due to trying different kinds of akincare products and this treatment toner cleared them up super fast. I love how gentle this toner is, it didn‚Äôt sting my skin at all and my sensitive skin didn‚Äôt react from it. I used it daily for a week but found that it was more effective to use it only 3x/week. I have been using this toner for 3 weeks now and I love it.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"Very happy with this. I love the fact is is a spray nozzle, has a gentle fragrance, not overpowering, feels light on the face.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"I‚Äôve been spending quarantine simplifying my skincare routine by focusing on active ingredients. I had narrowed it down to cerave cleanser, a great moisturizer, a great peptide serum, and .1% adapalene (with sunscreen in the AM). The results have been great, but I was still having some breakouts, some of which looked like fungal acne. After reading the reviews, I went ahead and tried this and it‚Äôs absolutely what my routine was missing. For reference, I tend to have really reactive skin that seems to despise vitamin c, hyaluronic serums, and direct oils (I have tried them all, even your favorite one lol). The acids in this don‚Äôt seem to scorch my skin like other hydroxy acid products do, but I get to enjoy the results of less pore congestion and smoother skin. So for those who‚Äôve commented that there technically isn‚Äôt aha/bha in this, I don‚Äôt really know what to say other than it sure as heck acts like there is.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Just make sure you hydrate your skin after applying this toner. It really strips away your facial oil,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"This was my first time using Cosrx products and I have to say, I‚Äôm very impressed. My skin is very oily and I have a lot of black heads and small white heads that lay deep beneath my skin. Prior to using these products, I would rub my face and feel so many little bumps beneath my skin and my face just felt awful to touch. Ya know that feeling when touching your face just puts you in a bad mood? ... like that!
Since my skin was oily, I choose mostly the BHA products since BHA loves oily skin. After cleansing my face, I start with the [Cosrx] AHA/BHA CLARIFYING TREATMENT Toner, then apply the [Cosrx] Bha Blackhead Power Liquid (It is a liquid but with a bit more consistency than water & leaves your face feeling moisturized), next the [Cosrx] Natural BHA Skin Returning Emulsion. At this point my face feels so fresh and soft, not greasy. However I also love to apply the Cosrx advanced snail 92 all in one cream to my face and neck as well. Now if you have the time, I suggest leaving 10 minutes between applying each product. (You‚Äôll most likely have that time in the evening before bed) It just helps the skin absorb the ingredients separately for better effectiveness rather than apply a jungle juice of ingredients at once.
After only a few days, WHAT A DIFFERENCE! My skin feels so much smoother, soft, less irritated and far less oily. My makeup sits so much better now.( Although if you are going to wear makeup, I would suggest not applying the snail cream.) I absolutely can‚Äôt stop touching my face! Seriously. It just doesn‚Äôt feel like my skin anymore. Will definitely keep using and explore more of their products.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"So light. Doesn't bother my sensitive skin. Apparently, I'm supposed to use a chemical exfoliant instead of a physical one cause I'm 51 with mature skin. This is way easier and kinder than rubbing grains all over my face. I started using this twice a week for awhile then upped it to 4. I can honestly say that my skin texture is very different now, it's actually healthy looking and even. That's the best way I can describe it. I should of taken pics but I didn't expect this much of a positive change. Glad I switched. Will be reordering.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"Nice toner! I've got a sensitive, oily face and this doesn't give me a reaction or anything bad. I use it with COSRX snail moisturizer and soon to be- essence. It doesn't give me any problems when I use it with another K Beauty face wash brand (ATOMY). In all, its good stuff and I highly recommend!",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"Exfoliation douce, parfaite pour peau sensible ou √† probl√®me!",4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"First things first, I have oily skin, so my review might not be for ppl who have different skin type than I do.
I have used 75% of this and it‚Äôs not even a month yet. Most of the timers that I have tried in the past lasted for a while maybe like almost 2 months, but not this one.
I didn‚Äôt like the spray bottle design, I prefer the ones you pour or squeeze into a cotton pad better, because I find my self spraying a lot when using this.
Anyways my skin. After using it for almost a month now, I have realized that my skin IS softer AND clearer. However, this is drying to my skin and so I use a bit more of my moisturizing serum, so if you have a dry skin, you might wanna do a patch test for a couple of days first before actually using it.",4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"Good for my oily/sensitive skin. After a week of using it, my skin texture changed. I used it am/pm and wake up with a smooth and glowing skin. Although my blackheads doesn't cleared up when using this.",4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Buy it,4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"This toner is actually great. It's lightly exfoliating and leaves my skin clear with so little effort on my part. It's a bit pricey; I apply it every evening and I imagine I'll only get 4-5 months out of this. However, so far I really like the way it makes my skin look and feel. I've had my eyes react poorly in the past to acids, but it's been fine so far to just spray my face and blot my eyes dry.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Have tried a number of toners and really loving this one,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Good one,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Worked well for me,5,,

COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,My holy grail! Love that they shipped so fast,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"I use this only at night when I plan on using an active, after makeup removing and cleansing. It helps get extra residue off and brings the skins PH down to help better absorb the active. Works great for my sensitive, oily, acne prone skin.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Nice,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,None,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,This was my first toner and I have found that it‚Äôs helped my skin and it‚Äôs very refreshing.,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"This product is honestly one of my favourite in terms of skin care. Although my skin is not completely smooth, It really helped reduce a great amount of texture I previously had. It does not sting or burn but feels very soothing and refreshing. I notice that right after I use it my skin feel very soft and supple. This is my second time buying it.
The only thing ‚Äúoff‚Äù was that the box was opened when I received the product. But other than that the product itself seems to be fine.",4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"This treatment toner helped my fungal acne! I had already been following the protocol from Simple Skincare Science, and my skin had been slowly getting better. Once I added this toner, my skin got better faster...and once I added The Ordinary's Niacinamide, the FA completely went away! If you are struggling with fungal acne (acne that doesn't respond to traditional acne remedies) I HIGHLY recommend checking out the SSS website to follow their protocol and to add this toner to your skincare regiment. I will definitely repurchase.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Arrived quicker than stated. Absorbs completely,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,I bought other Cosrx to help my son's acne and it cleared up within a week,5,,

COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Really like this product,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"I really like this product and will keep using it. On top of balancing the ph of your skin, it gently lifts dead skin cell and impurities from the skin. My skin looooves it! It gives a great brightening effect. Gentle enough for daily use. I use it just after cleansing and before a vitamin C serum (day routine) or before Klairs hydrating toner (night routine). I totally recommend.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Use about twice a week but it works well,4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"I have a very sensitive skin, having trouble finding the right product for my skin. When I used this product, I have no skin reaction at all. Highly recommended for people with very sensitive skin like me.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,I actually don‚Äôt know if it is helping my skin or my other products are. I switched my entire skincare routine to Korean brands and my skin looks bright and healthier than ever. I‚Äôm happy with this product as it doesn‚Äôt give me that greasy feeling. Very refreshing spraying it on my face!,4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,love it!,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"This is a good chemical exfoliant if you have sensitive skin. It's not super strong but will still slough off dead skin cells and help prevent whiteheads/blackheads. I have found that it is a little too gentle if you have active acne, for that you will need something stronger. But it is a very good product for everyday usage.",4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Very good product,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"I love this product! Along with following a good skin routine, when I introduced this toner to my routine I noticed a significant difference in hyperpigmentation from acne scars due to the AHA and BHAs in it. I only wish the bottle was bigger as using it twice a day I seem to run out quickly.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Love this brand of toner,4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"This is a ph adjusting toner which alters the ph of your skin to make your actives (vitamin c, aha, bha, etc) more effective. This toner does not contain enough AHA or BHA to exfoliate your skin, it is not meant for that!! This is used cleanser > ph adjusting toner > actives > hydrating toner > rest of routine. It seems to work very well, I have noticed good progress with my Vit C serum while using this toner!",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,awesome,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,So far loving this and haven‚Äôt had any breakouts from this,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Works great once u have washed and cleansed your face. Spray works great but is more effective when used with some cotton ball.,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Good source of AHA. Works very well.,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,I love this toner. It doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin or make me break out.,5,,

COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,I kept being told I needed AHA and BHA but didn't want to spend Sephora prices. This toner has changed the game. Hydrated and smooth always with less breakouts!,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Great product had made huge improvements to my skin,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"I love this product! Asian skincare toner is not like western toner, so moisturising and not drying or irritating! I use it twice a day, my pores and skin look great and helps other product absorb into my skin. I have used this for almost 2 years and is my absolute go to!",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"Really loved it! Already ordered another bottle. I was really skeptical about using aha and bha on my skin but it worked out great for me. I only use it in my nightime skincare routine before bed with a cotton pad. After maybe three weeks of using the product, I noticed I wasnt getting as much acne, specifically small white heads. My skin was also smoother and I felt like all my other products absorbed better.",4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Great Product,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"I got the AHA and the BHA toners too, but they made me break out in comedones like crazy!
Using this helped get them under control. Is good, will tone again.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"Love this toner, great for oily skin.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Love this product!,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"I'm in love with Cosrx! I've been on a mass shopping spree for Cosrx products since coming across the brand. I saw Cosrx featured on a few beauty blogs / videos as a company that's good for acne scarring and people that have acne problems. I'm in my 20s and still get acne so I really wanted products to help with that.
I've really noticed my skin improving since switching to Cosrx - my skin feels a lot smoother. This product in particular is meant to maintain the skin‚Äôs optimal pH level and prevent whiteheads and blackheads. I still do get whiteheads, but they are nowhere as big as the ones I used to get - the whiteheads I get now are much smaller and very manageable. They go away quite quickly compared to the ones I used to get. You're supposed to use this with a cotton pad - you spray it onto the cotton pad and wipe you face with it to exfoliate. It comes with a spray nozzle, so it's super easy to spread on a cotton pad! Not all Cosrx products come with a spray nozzle, so this is a great feature. I find my skin really feels fresh and not dried out at all when I use this! I'm hoping with continued use, all my whiteheads will go away.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Works amazing but is slightly drying,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Authentic. Works well as a pH-adjusting toner with mild exfoliation. Will repurchase.,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,It's a good daily exfoliating toner.... My skin is way too sensitive and it exfoliates my skin very well witout any breakouts or rashes..My skin loves it,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"Absolutely love this!
Would buy again and again!
This is my go-to toner!",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Good,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,This is a really nice toner that leaves my face feeling clean but does not dry it out. I have extremely oily skin and I feel that with the AHA it has made it less oily throughout the day.,4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"I really like this toner. It doesn‚Äôt dry my skin out like most AHA‚Äôs do, and it has a really nice scent to it. I broke out initially, but that may have been hormonal and nothing to do with this product. I will likely purchase this item again.",4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"I really like this toner, it has a nice mild smell, and absorbs into my skin well. I have mild acne and occasional pimples, and using this along with other Cosrx products helped clear my skin. I will be repurchasing.",5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,Box is beat up but the product was as described. Still haven't had the chance to thoroughly test the product.,5,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"really love it, especially for my oily combination that needs both aha and bha",4,,
COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"I have been using this product in conjunction with a more involved multiple-steps skin regimen. However, when I ran out of the first bottle, I rushed to get a second one! I used rose water in the meantime, but I really do prefer this toner: since I have used it, even my hormonal acne has been much better, and I can tell that my moisturizers have gone the extra step compared to before. There is no real strong scent to it, and it feels refreshing. As per the instruction, the trick is to use it on a cotton pad, which acts as an added very (very very) gentle exfolient, suitable for everyday use.",4,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Snail slime is the last thing I wanted to put on my face but this works. The peptides present in the mucin must be doing something because my skin feels plump. Worth a try in my opinion.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Each evening, after face washing a few drops of Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence cover my face, neck and arms. The non-greasy feeling make my skin feel refreshed and ready for moisturizer.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I did not know that I needed more hydration in my routine until I finally gave in to the hype and bought the cosrx snail mucin. It is as good as everyone says! It's a little sticky when you first apply ,but it sinks in, giving your skin the hydration that it needs. I love it! I don't think I can live without it now.",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I really wanted to love this product but sadly it did not work for me. I reached out to customer service to see if anything could be done. They offered a store credit but I had to pay shipping to return the item to them and since I got free shipping when I placed my order they would also be deducting that amount from my ‚Äústore credit‚Äù after all deductions my credit would be for about $7. I understand they are a small business but the customer service is not beneficial to the customer. I wish I would have read they return policy before so I would have purchased this item from another vendor that might have a more flexible return policy. My face broke out in cystic acne within 2 days of using the product and is still recovering from healing after almost a month of discontinued use. Be cautious if you have sensitive skin.,1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Finally understand the hype behind this product! Needed to switch to a different essence to help with the dry, cold weather and this was the perfect choice. It plumps my skin and provides the perfect amount of hydration that lasts all day.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"If you're looking to level up your skincare, a hydrating essence like this one is a must! It's restored elasticity in my skin during a time when I was training for a half marathon & losing a lot of water. It makes my skin feel so plump and I've gotten compliments on how my skin was glowing once I started using this product more regularly. I LOVE snail mucin & will continue to use this!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've been repurchasing this product for 2 years and will never stop. If this product only has one fan It's me. If it has zero fans, I'm dead.",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Light and moisturizing, perfect as a step after toning, absorbs quickly",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I absolutely love it. Been using it for just a few days and my skin is bouncy and hydrated. I was initially not too sure about it considering it is real snail mucin. But I heard a lot of good things about it and I'm happy I tried it out.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I‚Äôm on the snail train with this stuff! It‚Äôs so soothing and such a great step to use before retinol. It feels restorative and makes my skin glow. I only use at nights bc it leaves an interesting finish. Side note, I can‚Äôt say enough great stuff about OhLolly in general- way better pricing than other sites and their customer service is great too, they saved my package from getting delivered to the wrong place and are so quick and friendly. Thanks folks!!",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I don't know if I see any obvious difference, but it's light, doesn't have any smell, and feels good to apply.",4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,My first bottle of this snail mucin was a gift and it took running out of it for me to realize how much it was actually working for me. I have oily but parched skin and I‚Äôm in my 40‚Äôs so hydration and repair is key for me. As with all skin care products patience and regular use will yield the best benefits. This one absorbs very nicely on my skin and plays well with my other products. Especially soothing after treatments.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have sensitive combo skin and this toner made me too oily and breakout, even when I used only one pump.",4,,

I follow up w a moisturizer and use a rose quarts roller which works best for me.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"It must be close to 3 years since I started using Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence. I use it at night after toner and essence before thicker serums or right after acid or OTC retinol. I like the hydration it provides. If not using it when i run out while getting it shipped my skin gets slightly more irritated. I have come to appreciate it even more when I started using strong acids for exfoliation and otc retinol on a regular basis (i use drunk elephant). This essence provides a shooting/calming effect that I believe helps decreasing irritation when my skin is going thro some rough time (seasonal, hormonal, over- exfoliation / retinol). I can definitely tell my skin benefits from using specifically this essence over other multiple toner or essences I have try. It has become an staple. I am not sure about any other benefit such as anti-aging etc as I am not intending to properly testing in that way. I am 42 yr , normal-dry , dehydrated, hormone-sensitive, reactive skin.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I really like this product.. I have extremely oily skin.. like by mid-day have puddles of oil on my cheeks oily skin ( I know ew gross). Anyway, since using this product (and others) I have found my skin is properly hydrated and healing from acne. I was kinda scared it was gonna be sticky or like boogers.. but its not! It absorbs nicely and feels fresh!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Fantastic! SO hydrating!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"If you‚Äôre dry and need some extra love, you need this! Perfect for the nighttime, but it is sticky of course... it‚Äôs from snail so idk what you expect. It‚Äôs not that sticky after a few minutes though but adds an 110% dose of hydration",4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Lots of people of all skin types love this essence for good reason. It's quick to absorb, layers well, and great for all skin types, including my acne-prone dry skin. I used it every morning and every night. The biggest benefit I get from it is that without it, even my heavier moisturizers don't seem to do enough. So it's like a booster to help my other moisturizing products work like they're supposed to. I'll keep using this day and night as long as they make it!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Felt awesome on my skin. Will buy again.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Very thin consistency yet packs a powerful moisture punch!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This is great for my sensitive skin when I need an extra boost of moisture. I layer it under Benton snail bee cream and it has calmed my skin overnight and faded hyperpigmentation.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Caused acne with direct application but better tolerated mixed into moisturizer. Not seeing much change.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is really hydrating. I have dehydrated oily skin and with this in my regimen my skin looks and feels so much better. It does have a tacky consistency that I had to get used to, but it doesn‚Äôt interfere with my makeup or other parts of my regimen.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I love the cosrx snail mucin and will purchase it again. My skin felt wonderfully soft and moisturized.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Love it!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is my second bottle of this essence. I love it. It repairs, heals and give skin a supple elasticity. Snail mucin is now among my favorite ingredients like aloe, propolis and Vitamin E. Highly recommend and a bottle lasts for months",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have been hearing how amazing the cosrx snail essence is so I decided to try it for myself. I recently wrecked my skin by overexfoliating and it was very dry and dehydrated. This product made my skin go back to normal in only a week. It is so hydrating and soothing. It has no scent which I like because I am sensitive to most fragrance. The texture is slimy but it sinks right into your skin. This was my first time ordering from Oh Lolly but it won‚Äôt be my last. The shipping was super fast and I love the selection of products they offer.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I love the smell and texture it's really unique and feels amazing on my skin!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,It‚Äôs not too sticky (remember it is snail) and absorbs quickly!,5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have been using this product for almost 6 months now. It was the first essence I had ever purchased, and I was expecting more dramatic changes to my skin than what I saw early on. The texture was less slimy than I had anticipated, but will give you a positive ""string test"" between your fingers. It applies with a slightly tacky feel, but when layered with a face oil, moisturizer and SPF does not cause any issues with makeup application. It does provide some instant hydration, which for my skin was enough in the summertime but is inadequate now during the winter. I find that I need more layers of toner beneath this essence (have yet to try the 7 skin method!) to achieve the same degree of hydration, so this for me wasn't exactly a holy grail product. Nonetheless, I feel that layering this product does somehow help to smoothen and almost prime my skin, which is why I am persisting with this product through the winter months. I am also still holding out hope that with continued use throughout my 30s, I will see some of the anti-aging benefits that have been attributed to snail mucin.",4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is one effective product. It's got a thickish, serum sort of texture but goes on my skin very smooth and absorbs nicely. It then magically turns my skin baby soft. I love it. It doesn't smell like anything, there's no scent at all. It comes in a big bottle. I have dry skin and I highly recommend it.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is one of my favorite products ..like...ever! Is super hydrating, absorbs quickly, leaves skin soft and I use it almost every night. I highly recommend it :)",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,HOLY GRAIL.,5,,

Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,Good Cleanser but I found the scent really unpleasant.,4,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"This cleanser i use before but now I buy another one for skin cupid
It‚Äôs not same I don‚Äôt why",1,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"I like it for cleaning my skin, but it can leave a bit of a dryness afterwards. It doesn't affect me as I moisturise after and I have oily skin anyway but it's something to note. Otherwise it lathers great and smells nice enough and is perfect for double cleansing.",4,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"I thought this cleanser would be good because the COSRX sunscreen was so effective, but I am disappointed in this cleanser. It didn‚Äôt meet my expectations and left my skin feeling less dry and greasy, maybe its the gel formula that doesn't suit my skin.

Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,Bought this alongside the HARUHARU WONDER Black Rice Moisture Deep Cleansing Oil and I've been using it for a week or so and my skin feels and looks so much better already. A little goes along way with this and it makes your skin feel really clean without leaving your skin dry. I would say it has quite a strong fragrance however its a mix of tee tree and citrus which Im not a massive fan of but the product works so well I'm not bothered by it.,5,,
Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser,"i feel so irritation or dryness after washing off this cleanser, which is amazing. fragrance-free, is always a plus; and the texture is nice and lightweight, lathers well and applies well. overall, an amazing cleanser",4,,

It feels better than any moisturizer I've ever used. ever. after a solid hour I can feel other moisturizer brands like Olay on my face and even using a very small amount still makes my face look oily but snail 96 absorbs quickly and only after about 30 minutes my face is smooth, glowing, hydrated and doesn't give that shiny look that makes me look like i just got back from the gym I'm going to recommend this to my sister",5,,

Switch the advertise for the one I want. They sent me the wrong one which is a different version, they're trying to tell me it's just a package change which is not true. I've been using my eyeliner for over 25 years. So I know what it is. It's the new version they've sent me. Which I don't want and they're not. Don't even advertising that one. I've asked him to send me a label so I can send it back with their own cost for shipping. They're taking forever answering it, which means I'd have to go to my credit card company. And dispute this matter and make them pick it up, which I don't want anyways. I paid $25 apiece ordered 6 of them paying $140. What they sent me. I can buy it for $12 or $15 at places like Amazon and some stores. I paid them double the price because they were advertising. The one I wanted and they sent me the wrong stuff. Why would I pay double the price for something? I don't want and I can get it for half the price.. Watch out if you're buying anything from this company.",1,,

Neutrogena Facial Wash Fresh & Clear With Pink Grapefruit Pump 200Ml,Very good service . Appreciated,5,,
Neutrogena Facial Wash Fresh & Clear With Pink Grapefruit Pump 200Ml,". Face wash have a very strong citrusy smell, which is a bit too strong for me..
. The results are not great really I have been using it for many days now and I really don't see significant changes in the way my skin feels
. But on the good side, this face wash is very refreshing and is not harsh on skin, I highly recommend if you have oily skin as this face wash will keep the moisture but will remove the oilyness.
. Overall a average product, nothing special.

The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,"I was finally able to get my hands on this product. Each time I went looking for it, it was sold out. I now know why! After 1-2 uses, it removed so much dead skin you wouldn't believe it. I have become a bit of a skin care freak once I got in my late twenties. Unfortunately, I started getting sun damage and dark spots. A lot of this has already been reversed thanks to retinol, kojic acid, niacinamide, hydroquinone and face steaming. (All under the care of a licensed dermatologist of course.) But if you're looking for something to even out your skin tone and texture, as well as get rid of dead skin, this is the product for you. I am happy to say I have found another product to add to my skin care routine.",5,,
The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,"Works wonders for underarms, you literally wont wven smell. And has the heels if my feet softer than a new born baby. I tried on my scalp an it caused major itching and burning, I dont have flaky scalp so maybe thats why. Also was a bit harsh on my face. I returned it but after noticing my under arms and feet I'll definitely order another bottle for that.",5,,
The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,it was burning and tingling like 100 ants where biting my face and other products burn too so i had to go to school with visible chemical burns i will never be buying the ordinary AGIAN! If you want better brands bubble and byoma are my go to,4.3,,
The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,I have used this toner for years but i am now concerned of the quality. Seems like the formula has changed some too. I ordered online and received the product which had a unknown black substance floating in it. Was replaced and no floaty things.,5,,
The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,You definitely have to use regularly for any results. Burns a little at first but goes away. I wouldn't repurchase because of how many cotton pads you need to use for this product. I want to try a roll-on or lotion product next for ease of application and convenience.,2,,
The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,"I was faithful to a different toner for the past 4 years and it basically has been discontinued so I decide to him give this one a try and I love it, it doesn't make my face red or irritated and does the job face feels so clean and looks exfoliated!",1,,

I try to use it at night as well so I wake up with beautiful skin that looks hydrated and bouncy. I only use it sometimes during the day because I wear full glam every day for work and it is a little heavy on the serum side, and does not really dry down, so when I do skin prep, I have a few products with HA in it already. But I can always tell a difference when I'm not using it. I also use it on my neck, collarbone, and hands.",4.3,,

Skin Care Set,"i was excited to try to product because my niacinamide was out and i wanted to try some of the ordinary's other products because i usually love them, but the niacinamide was not the same consistency as it normally is. i use it everyday and it's usually pretty watery but the one that came in this package was gooey and hard to apply. so far ive liked the other two products that came in this package but im really disappointed in the niacinamide because this is a daily product i use and now im gonna have to buy another one because this just isnt the same thing",5,,

Acne Skin Care Set,Severe redness and irritation on dark skin,5,,
Acne Skin Care Set,I dont hate it. It hasn't done anything significant yet but I think it's helping.,3,,
Acne Skin Care Set,I would totally recommend this product. With that being said ive only been using it for 2 days and have some pointers for someone looking to use it. I wash my face 2 times a day and have sensitivish skin. Normally as long as i buy products made for sensitive skin i have no issues. The face wash seems to be great as well as the moisturizer for daily use. The moisturizer is different from others ive used it leaves my face feeling a little tight once it dries which im liking. I think it could be a little more moisturing but it isnt leaving any irritation or anything. The syrum however is pretty harsh because its drying which does help clear the acne. Is says to use it once a day starting out which i think is where you go wrong when you have sensative skin. I can feel that it is a bit irritating but once used i did notice my acne clearing. I try to listen to my body so the only recommendation i can give is to use the facewash and moisturizer daily and the syrum once or twice a week max and when you so use it put it on then once dried apply the moisturizer over top. Do not use it everyday it will dry your skin. Definitely helping sooo much with my acne though. Hope i was help to someone. Also cant beat the price.,5,,
Acne Skin Care Set,I get really bad acne breakouts on my jawline area and dry skin. I saw a difference in my skin after using this for a week. It really controls my acne and keeps my skin hydrated. Will definitely be purchasing this again.,1,,

It obviously wont make your hair grow over night, you have to give it time. I do feel that this product helped me rather than not using any product at all.

Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,"i wanted to try this serum to help fill in an uneven spot around my hairline, but i had to stop after two days of use. i have NEVER had issues with itchy scalp or dandruff before, but this gave me both almost immediately!! i followed instructions and used a few drops on clean, freshly blowdried hair right before bed, but the following day i was just so unconfortably itchy and dry!",5,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,I've almost finished my first bottle of this product and am very pleased to see new hair growth filling in my hairline. I think ive had some traction alopecia and/or hair loss concentrated around my previous early 2000-2010s side part that i just started noticing a couple years ago. I can see many new short strands of hair growing from this problem spot that i have been targeting so i hope they will continue to grow out.,1,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,Notices my hair just really thinning out and well I always use tree tea oil to help with the growth but wasn't doing much a small part near my forehead. It's been 2 weeks of consistent use and I can tell a different so I'm hopeful with more use it will be back to normal. I can tell ay hairs are actually growing bc of how they stand up like baby hairs ü§ûüèºü§ûüèº so far so good,1,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,"i tried this hair oil for some hair thinning problems i had been having recently and i typically use a lot of the ordinary's products with great success! this hair oil definitely was not for my hair type because i did notice some slight regrowth in my hair and it didnt leave my roots feeling greasy at all, but within the few days i was using the hair oil my ends were incredibly dry and brittle and strands of hair broke off super easily. i think it will work for specific hair types, just not mine.",1,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,It irritated my scalp every now and then. Some days it wasnt irritated so I continued use. I have hair loss now and I will be discontinuing the product. Wish I could get my money back.,4.1,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,"I feel like most of the time serums don't work for my hair/skin, but this product definitely did. I included pictures so you can see, the first picture was taken on July 1 and you can see a pretty decent bald spot and widened hair line. The second picture was taken on October 24, so just shy of 4 months, and the balding has completely stopped, along with a much healthier hair line. I see tons of baby hairs growing in still! I will also add that I have incorporated a lot more protein into my diet, which I think is helping with hair growth, too, but this serum is incredible! I just bought my second bottle. You definitely have to be consistent with it and it will not happen overnight, but it's worth the little bit of effort for healthier hair :)",5,,

I'll update again with results after using it more,1,,

Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,I've been using the product for about a month and am already seeing results. The hair at the crown where it had gotten thin is noticeably thicker already. The product is easy to use. I use it every night.,5,,

Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,Says to put it in clean dry hair but it will make your hair look very greasy after. Not sure if it works yet as I just started using it.,5,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,"I noticed after years of religiously using dry shampoo that i was shedding A LOT. I have very fine hair, and previously an oily scalp by the end of day 1 washed hair. With using this product i can wash my hair in the morning, apply to my scalp at night, and my hair is not greasy by the next morning. I have also noticed a significant amount of less shedding in the shower and in my brush. Still on my first bottle :)",5,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,I started loosing a lot of hair just after 2-3 times of using this product. This never happened to me before.,4.1,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,"I have been diagnosed with androgenetic alopecia. I have seen less shedding using a small amount that I massage in nightly. Although, I would love my hair to thicken up, I'll take less shedding.",5,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,"First, understand healthy scalp hair takes 2-3 months to grow an inch. Longer if that hair is fine or follicle is aging. There is no quick results with what this product is - a peptide serum. Set realistic expectations. I'm mid late 30s, starting to see more quite a bit new white hairs, and possibly mild thinning on my cowlick and sides of the widow peak. I have a lot of almost black, thin, fine hair that doesn't hold a curl. I mostly wanted to see if this would help support ponytail breakage hairs growing back, and test if I do have thinning. I use this serum at night down my part, front hair line, 2 lines into the sides of my head and the bottom where I have a lot of high ponytail breakage. After using this product for about 4 months, I could tell a darker fullness to my front hairline! My middle part seems to be a less thick line too. I can't tell on my cowlick, maybe ever so slightly a bit darker from new hairs. I trialed not using it for a month while I traveled a ton. Some of that darkening faded, but not completely. I didn't notice more fallout than usual. If you stop using or don't use most days, results will diminish. After 6 months, my front hair line hairs are actually now down to a bang length! I can also put the awkward hair in front of my ears behind them, it doesn't just stick back out again, and some longer strands started to pull it all back into my pony. And more of my back hairs are reaching my ponytail again. That's the thing I did want it to help with! My back hairline broken hair has definitely gotten longer and healthier, I have less broken hairs falling out, and I think I'll have a bigger improvement here in the next 6 months. I did not expect a miracle, I still have quite a bit of hair where balding isn't noticeable, and so I'm pleased with the results knowing a peptide serum has a limit to what it can do. I've also switched brushes, to a microfiber towel and satin pillowcases too. Even spilling a good chunk of the bottle, it lasted me this 8 months since I don't put it on my whole head. The serum dropper is not the ideal format, but it helps me get direct on the scalp. I'll order another and see how long I stay consistent. I do like this is helping broken hairs grow back and preventing some slight signs of losing hairs. It's not pointless, but it is subtle. The subtleness over time is what will produce noticeable results.",1,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,I did not have much hair fall when I started using this product. 2.5 weeks in and I now have bald spots that are very sensitive! This is such a shame!,1,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,"I love the ordinary facial products, so I tried to use this hair care but it did not work at all and also whenever I use this serum it negatively effects my sleeping schedule.",4,,

(It's recommended to use at night, but i shower in the mornings and use then.)",5,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,"My hair had been falling out so much more than it used to. I especially noticed how much was falling out in the shower. So, I started using this and have been for just about 4 months now. The difference is amazing- I can actually see all of the new growth coming through! I just apply a few drops to the top of my scalp and rub it in. I added a photo where you can see all the newer untamed baby hairs at the top of my head! I love this stuff and have still barely made a dent in the bottle. Just a few drops go such a long way!",1,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,"i've always had pretty thin since i was little. for years i was bleaching my hair, which thinned it out even more. recently i went back to my natural brown and i wanted something that would revive + add the thickness of my hair. i've been using this almost every night for almost 2 months on only my scalp and putting it up for bedtime, and i notice an obvious difference in my hair. there's more volume and the hair growing in is thicker and healthier. my hairdresser even said she noticed a difference in my hair! def recommend, especially if you're trying to recover after hair damage from bleaching, like me.",4,,

Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,I have been using this for almost a year now and have seen results after using it for 5 months. I was starting to have a small bald patch near my front hair parting and had started to look at hair-topper options. This serum has not only helped in new hair growth in that bald area but has reduced my overall hair fall. I have already been recommending this product to my friends who complain of thinning hairs,1,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,"I've been using this serum multiple nights a week for a few months now. There's been a noticeable increase in baby hairs growing and my hair is a lot thicker too. For me this works better than taking a hair supplement because I will forget to take those, as this is easily incorporated into my nighttime skincare routine.",5,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,"After using the serum for a period of 6 months, I did not observe any visible improvement in the growth of baby hair or hair growth in the specific areas where I was hoping to see results.

Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,I love Ordinary products and bought this just to hopefully make hair thicker.

I have stopped use and am hoping hair grows back.,1,,

Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,"I bought this a few years ago after I had gotten so frustrated with my hair after the post baby shed. My hair was thin (especially around my face, looked like I had a receding hair line at my temples). After years of hoping the post baby regowth would magically appear and continuously cutting my hair short so everything could catch up, I gave up, and then found this product. Now, you have to be patient and consistent. You might not notice anything after you finish the first bottle, it does take time, but there is a pay off. I have been using it consistently for a couple of years now and my hair is so much thicker than when I started. The last time my hair was this thick was when I was a little kid. No, its not my hair bouncing back post baby shed, I waited for five years for that to happen and it never did. I found this, tried it, and I will continue to recommend this product. Use it at night before you go to bed. If you use too much your hair will be a little greasy, but if you use as directed your hair won't look and feel greasy. There's no smell, there's no residue, and I've never had any issues with my scalp being irritated in any way when using this product. Give it a go. Also, their lash and brow serum is amazing. My lashes are fuller and longer and it rescued my thin millennial brows (also be patient with that, all good things take time).",5,,
Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,"I bought this serum a few weeks ago from the store after reading so many positive reviews. I have been experiencing excess hair shedding since the past few months which I am chalking up to my hormonal imbalance. I am in the process of getting by blood work and ultrasound done to find out what's going on and wanted to try this serum meanwhile to help with the hair regrowth. I used a few drop of the serum all over my scalp and lightly massaged it with my fingers for a few minutes, let it stay overnight and washed it the next morning with my regular shampoo, followed by conditioner. I have used the serum 3-4 times, every few days but found that my hair fall has increased even more after using this so I have decided to not continue anymore.

I have only been using this product for one week and I have seen a significant difference in hair growth and thickness.

However, after one week, my hair looks fuller in the front and I do not need to use a brown spray. Love this product - just ordered more.",1,,

Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density,I have been using this on and off on my scalp and eyebrows. I really can't tell if there is much of an improvement but will continue for a few more bottles to notice some improvement. It does cause some break out along the hairline.

Anti-Aging Peptide Serum with Hydration,"since 2021 I've mostly been using this. I occasionally try other products, but this is ol' reliable. I prefer not too many actives in the AM, but it's nice to have peptides and amino acids to help hydrate & start the day.

Squalane Cleanser For Dry Skin,"So, firstly, I did not do my research on Squalane. Your face naturally produces squalene to moisturize your face, but it traps oils in your pores.

I actually used to have to test products on my wrist since i could accidentally chemical burn my face, since i had no skin barrier left from all the poor skin maintence in my teens. I wanted something to help with redness and naturally heal my skin instead of the chemicalized 1 stop shop products, that are expensive and end up not working for me. Over the last 6 months ive seen significant decrease in redness in my t zone. It was not over night but gradual in about 30 day increments for me to see a difference.

Prob the first product ive been able to use. I was just diagnosed with roscea. This product seems to calm & mosturize, more than get rid of redness. But redness is a hard thing to get rid of, so i will give this grace. It sooths my skin amd gives me a nice glow! Im getting a cream from my derm.

As a result, there are almost ALWAYS chewed up looking red spots and scabs on my neck that can never heal before shaving again. Simply 4 to 5 drops of this spread evenly over that area over shaving has my neck cleared up for the first time in years. I've also found this is great for any part of the body where the skin has been compromised and scabbed over. This in combo with the hyaluronic acid and niacinamide and a good lotion has left me feeling confident about my face consistently and I'm simply over the moon about it < 3",1,,
Soothing & Barrier Support Serum,"I DESTROYED my skin barrier from working in ovens and walk-in freezers. Nothing seemed to repair it, til i found this!

My face looks and feels nearly the same except I now dont get greasy like their regular moisturizer gets me greasy. It also smells like wet paint yall. I'm not exaggerating or kidding even a little bit. It smells EXACTLY like you freshly painted the walls. The smell does dissipate fairly quickly (within thirty minutes or less). Im hoping to get better results as time goes on. Other moisturizer's have given me quicker results than this. And yes, I've researched this product and am using it appropriately and with the products I'm supposed to use in conjuction with it. Yes, I'm also using the appropriate amount. I've used the Ordinary products for years and love them. Hopefully I'll love this one too.",1,,

100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"I don't really prefer this oil for my combo skin personally. It's nothing bad about it, I just realize my skin doesn't do well with oils. But it's AMAZING for the body. It's super smooth, and silky, and almost cushiony in a way. It's lightweight too. And it just glides against your skin so efforlessy.

100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,Hi I'm 43 years old and once I hit 40 my skin got dry. That was new to me since all of my life I fought oily skin. 10 years ago I never would've thought of applying an oil to my skin. But in the last few years my skin just soaks everything up and still remains dry. This has been wonderful. It has really improved my skin tone. And it moisturizes my skin well without leaving it greasy. I'm still just in shock that I'm able to put an oil on my face but it has been amazing.,5,,

100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"I think ANY oil may risk breaking some of us out. That said, i was pleasantly surprised by how well this absorbed into my skin while I used it to Gua Sha. It has a slight yellow tint, which does create a ""glow"" when combined with the shine of the oil. My skin feel supple and soft after I use it. Some days I just buff the oil in by gently rubbing it with a dry towel after its had a moment to absorb. Sometimes I rinse it off with a cool washcloth after I Gua Sha. Sometimes I use it at night in place of my gel moisturizer because it does make my skin soft. Overall I like it!",1,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"I don't typically review immediately after the first use but I jumped straight on here because y'all need to KNOW. This stuff feels SO GOOD. I have combination skin leaning toward oily and I also get eczema. All the oil control products flare my eczema, conversely eczema products make me super oily. I tried to find a happy medium with products for mature skin, but no. Tonight I used my cleanser, an AHA toner, applied Ordinary's lactic acid, then Ordinary's Rose Hip Seed Oil, then my moisturizer. When I tell you my skin hasn't been this soft and comfortable in 30 years, I am saying the last time my skin felt even close to this comfortable I was TWELVE YEARS OLD. Its such a light oil‚Ä¶within 5 minutes your skin just soaks it up and feels so soft and flawless. My 6 year old daughter is napping next to me as I write this, and my cheek is as soft as her cheek. No itching, no tightness, no greasy film just sitting on top of my skin. I am absolutely astonished. I feel like one application erased years of using the wrong products for my skin. I am officially converted and brand-loyal. Putting this stuff on subscription‚Ä¶",5,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,Great product love the entire collection. Leaves your skin smooth and perfect for a bare face or make up application.,4.4,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,I really love this product. I've noticed my skin is so dewy and plump since using this. Looks and works great with my Glossier skin tint. Only thing is the smell like so many others have mentioned. It's earthy and not that pleasant. But still bearable.,5,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,This is very hydrating and doesn't break out my sensitive skin. It is an oil so I cant use makeup over it. I apply it at night instead of moisturizer combined with toner and on mornings I know I wont need to wear makeup.,2,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,I've had very dry skin my entire life and this product has truly transformed my face! I've been using this oil for well over a year each night before going to bed. It leaves my skin glowing and radiant. I'm constantly being asked by strangers what I use to achieve the healthy glow - truly the best product for such a reasonable price.,5,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"Im on my third bottle of this stuff , rose hip and rose essence is super good for the face and maintaining firm skin and locking in moisture. I love this stuff. The only thing i dont like is as it gets older and used it started to get gummy and crusty around the top so you gotta clean it off once in awhile and it the oil does have a weird smell lol but it doesnt bother my skin at all",4,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"I was looking for a face oil, i recently started my skin healing journey. I had a damaged skin barrier; and i didn't know i did until i started breaking out randomly really bad, my face had a bunch of tiny white papules on the front of my cheeks, i had redness for days, and not to mention the random cystic acne as well. My skin was DRY and tight but oily at the same time. I was having dry patches and underneath it.. OILY. I used to shave my peachfuzz on my sideburns, (Dermaplaning), which only added to my dryness and irritation. Not to mention i was using a very stripping facewash. Regular face lotions wernt cutting it. I even tried CeraVe and all it did was break me out, like itchy and uncomfortable breaking out! So i invested in this wonderful oil. I use it right out of the shower or after washing my face with the Cetaphil hydrating foaming cleanser. The oil does have an earthy smell but nothing too overbearing. Its light! Doesn't bother me at all and im actually prone to headaches if i smell strong scents. So no need to worry about the scent. This oil has really helped rebuild my skin barrier! I couldn't even pop a pimple because my nails would peel my skin! It was that bad! This oil doesn't feel greasy at all. Its a very light oil. Does not break me out at all! If anything it has helped my breakouts. It calms the redness right down when im breaking out all over my cheeks and it has helped with redness in general that i always had. My skin feels so soft now, bounces back, has stopped having dry patches, and does not injure easily as it did before. Im so happy with this face oil. Only con i would have to say is that it sits on top of your skin for about an hour if you dont put a mositurizer on top, which isn't necessary a bad thing because i appreciate the extra layer of protection between my skin and the freezing dry air this winter. I really love this oil so much and im thankful i found this. I would like to add however once again, that you do need to use a mositurizer on top because the oil is not enough for this cold winter air. I use the neutrogena hydro boost on top of the oil. Extremely happy with this product. Will purchase again!",4.4,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"I have used this face oil for a couple of years now and although I love how it makes my skin feel when added to my night skin routine, the smell is awful. It reminds me almost of dog pee. As much as I like the feel of it, I'm looking for a new product because i can hardly stand the smell anymore.",5,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"I started using this about two weeks ago and I'm pretty satisfied. As stated in other reviews, it does have an unpleasant smell, but you don't want perfumey products on your face anyway. So. I use this following my hydroboost moisturizer and its made a noticable difference in my dry skin and the overall look of my skin. It does moisturize and I would argue, for me anyway, helps with uneven skin tones and redness. I'm glad I bought it!",2,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"Feels a bit oily at first but then it is quickly absorbed into your skin, leaving it silky and soft. Works wonders on my daughter's sensitive skin due to eczema. Highly recommend!",5,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"this stuff is great for moisture in my nighttime routine. I put 3-4 small drops before bed, and I haven't broken out, my face looks lovely and feels smooth in the morning! my only complaint, and maybe I'm using something wrong, is that I also use the niacinimide and hyaluronic acid drops at night as well as both of those say to use in the PM. I put them on first, let them dry for a few mins, but when I put the rose seed oil on over the other two, they just don't mix well and my face feels all gritty. Still ok in the morning, but I've just been alternating- one night niacinimide + hyaluronic acid, one night rose hip seed oil alone and that seems to work ok!",3,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"My daughter actually recommended this product to me years ago and the moment I tried it I was hooked.

100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,I use this every day under my makeup and a last step every night. It adds the right amount of moisture and glow. I've used biossance squalene oil and other expensive options and this is still my favorite!,2,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"I have dry, acne-prone, sensitive skin, and this seems to help. I've brrn through maybe four bottles now. I'd say it seems to help, switched to this from a retinol that kept me in an unending purging phase ‚Äî I read rosehip seed oil can help with acne scarring/marks. So far I haven't seen any evidence of that, but I still really like it for addressing dryness and topping off a slightly sticky-textured serum I use with a high glycerin content to help my skin feel smooth and supple.",5,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,Rosehip oil has amazing benefits but it can also cause breakouts for acne prone skin. I have not had breakouts in like this since highschool and the only change was adding this to my gua sha routine.,5,,

100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,I use a drop of this below each eye after cleansing and before applying night cream. I definitely notice a difference in the morning when I do this. I also sometimes add a drop to my moisturizer in winter when I need a little extra hydration.,5,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"For the price I do love how it makes my skin feel in the morning. The smell is pretty bad though. My husband says it smells like herbal tea and I say it smells like wet compost mid summer. I'll likely buy it again because of the price point, any more expensive and I'd pass.",2,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"I have been using rose hip seed oil as a part of my skincare for years. It helped heal my acne scars, and really hydrates my skin. I have tried many different kinds and they all seem to work great, including this one. However, this stuff smells like hot garbage. Like someone vomited last nights dinner on your face. I have to hold my breath while putting this on because if I get a whiff I will audibly gag. So maybe try another brand.",5,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"Amazing, within days my skin has tremendously improved. I have very oily skin and believe it or not but if you add oil to your skincare routine‚Ä¶ it reduces how much oil your natural skin produces. I use this overnight",5,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"I love this product so much! I bought this rosehip oil back in February and have been using it with my body lotion after a shower, in addition to my face. My skin looks radiant, and is so smooth to the touch. Highly recommended for face or for body!",4.4,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"The oil itself has a really nice feel and absorbs into the skin well, but it gave me a retinol burn & made my skin irritated, bumpy, and discolored after use. I wouldn't buy it again, but you might enjoy it if your skin isn't sensitive.",5,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"Ok im only writing a comment because that girl Ashleigh from Seattle commented with a stupid perspective and it shouldnt sway you from purchasing based off of her prefrence in smell. The product is amazing. You dont even need a lot. (To me) it gives like a lite olive oil vibe. With a light smell that reminds me of like a dark oil like olive or avacado or even almond oils I usually get from wholes food. I personally do 1 or 2 drops in my hand. My Bf has acne issues with horrible break outs and scarring and this really has transformed his face in a positive direction. He loves it which means i love it for us. He does the drops around his T Zone. I just do 1-2 drops in my hand after a cleanser (la roshe purifying foaming wash) and its lasted 3 months. I have oily skin, and 1 drop at night does me good until the next night. PLEASE BUY ill be there this week for my next one. The smell is faint and fades in 5 secs.",2,,

100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,I have extremely dry skin. I usually choose products made for dry skin. I put 3 drops on my face by mistake one morning and it started out dewy with a nice powdery finish. By lunchtime I had 3 whiteheads out of nowhere... I don't EVER breakout. I use this to dermaplane my face on the regular but I finish with a calming cleanser and I've never had an issue until it went on by itself.,4.4,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"I've used several different products from The Ordinary and loved them so I had high hopes for this. Unfortunately it smells horribly. When I opened the bottle it was unpleasant but once I started to apply it, the smell became overpowering. It was so revolting that I immediately washed it off. Two hours later I still smell it. I'm returning it first thing tomorrow.",5,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,"I use this product with several other steps from The Ordinary. I use it before applying my moisturizer and it is very oily. Yes, I understand it's an oil but I wasn't expecting the greasy feeling to last so long. A little bit definitely goes a long way! I apply it both day and night and the next morning when I wake up my skin is super soft but still pretty oily. I don't think it has a fish smell like some other reviews say. I think it smellys rosey and earthy. I also use it on my hands for extra moisurizer when needed and it works great for that too! Overall, I recommend at least trying it and giving it a few weeks before you decide whether you like it or not. Give it time to work.",2,,
100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for Aging Skin,This product has become a staple in my night routine. I put it on top of my moisturizer or retinol and it helps keep my skin moisturized.

Matrixyl 10% + HA High-Strength Wrinkle Support Serum,I have been using this serum for years now. I absorbs well and feels so nice on the skin.

Matrixyl 10% + HA High-Strength Wrinkle Support Serum,"I'm 23 years old and for some reason have fine lines around my eyes from smiling. Ever since I used this product, those lines are GONE. It definitely smooths out all the lines and plumps the skin. Matrixyl is a very good and proven ingredient to boost collagen. 1 bottle lasted me 3 months. I'm very happy with it and will continue to purchase!",2,,
Matrixyl 10% + HA High-Strength Wrinkle Support Serum,"I started using Matrixyl in Jan 2024 in AM only, so just over 4mths in. I love what it's doing for my skin, so far. It's a lovely light serum that works great with my moisturizer, sunscreen and makeup. I use niacinamide & retinal.02% at night (having stepped up slowly with lower retinoids) and the combination has really started giving results. I've recently had 3 totally random comments about how good my complexion looks (I've never had happen before)! I'm fair skinned with freckles and over the years gained sun damage, pigmentation, wrinkles, enlarged pores, breakouts and more! All of these latter issues are definitely improving - I wish I'd started this skincare regime years ago! I love The Ordinary products and im so glad I started using them.",5,,
Matrixyl 10% + HA High-Strength Wrinkle Support Serum,"Even though I just entered my 20s, I started getting forehead lines that are visible even when my face is at rest. This has been the only formula to soften my forehead lines and help with dehydration. The texture is also my favorite out of everything I use. It would be great if there were larger bottle options like with the niacinamide. I got through them like water.",5,,
Matrixyl 10% + HA High-Strength Wrinkle Support Serum,"I've been using this for the past 5 months and the difference it has made, especially on my neck, is nothing short of amazing! It has also helped firm my smokers lines, the area around my jaw line where, when your 54, tends to get little crinkled after being slept on overnight. The improvements have extended to the rest of my face but my neck and jawline have benefited the most. I will absolutely continue using it and recommend it to my friends and family.",4.5,,

Multi-Peptide Anti-Aging Eye Serum,"Quality product, reasonable price for mature skin (normal to oily).",4,,
Multi-Peptide Anti-Aging Eye Serum,This product works. I have both under eye serums and this one is by far the best. I can now write a legitimate review after so much use that this eye serum actually works. It shouldn't dry out or burn it's just an oily base. It takes away my dark circles I don't have puffy under eyes only dark circles. I have very sensitive skin that easily breaks out as well this and the product with the pink color are by far the best on here and I've used many.,5,,

Multi-Peptide Anti-Aging Eye Serum,This product works. I have both under eye serums and this one is by far the best. I can now write a legitimate review after so much use that this eye serum actually works. It shouldn't dry out or burn it's just an oily base. It takes away my dark circles I don't have puffy under eyes only dark circles. I have very sensitive skin that easily breaks out as well this and the product with the pink color are by far the best on here and I've used many.,5,,

It does its job as a lightly exfoliating toner but still feels soothing. It definitely doesn't have the sting of the old toners (Seabreeze anyone? My fellow GenXers know).

Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner,"From the first time I used this it made my lips feel weirdly fuzzy even though I didn't use it near my lips. I still continued to use it for about a month and I felt like it was an alright toner for my skin aside from the weird feeling on my lips. Eventually my lips started to shred. Like, not just peel from being dry, but shred like I've never experienced. After about a week of that I stopped using the toner altogether. Within a few days the corners of my mouth became open sores that would crack and bleed then scab over. I'm now using an anti fungal ointment that is helping to heal the corners of my mouth. I guess this toner made my lips peel to the point it made me susceptible to an infection? So long story short: if this makes your lips feel funny just return it, don't keep using it.",5,,

Make sure you give it a good shake too.",1,,
Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner,"I have tried SO many skincare products, most of which either seem to make my skin break out or don't make any real noticeable difference (many other Ordinary products included). This toner, however‚Ä¶ GAME CHANGER. My skin has never looked more glowy and smooth. Breakouts are pretty much non-existent when I use this, and if I have to go a few days without it, I can really tell a difference. I use this morning and night after double cleansing and before using Vanicream moisturizer. I don't even wear makeup as much because I love the way my skin looks. I will continue to buy this as long as it exists (please be forever)!",1,,

I have dry skin, so I was somewhat surprised to see a product with such a simple ingredients list and mostly hydrating ingredients do this. Just because it broke me out doesn't mean it will for you too, so if have acne prone skin you're curious, try it and keep the receipt. Also is slightly annoying how small the bottle is, The Ordinary products are definitely getting smaller and more expensive posg-acquisition. You can definitely get similar milky toner products from Asian brands for cheaper on sites like Stylevana.",4.6,,

Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner,"I love this. I had to stop using the glycolic acid due to developing skin issues and i had been waiting for the ordinary to drop another toner. This is perfect for sensitive skin. My skin isnt dull after, no burning or irritation, not stripping. It calms my redness and inflammation a bit. The smell is different but it is a fermented product so thats to be expected. I only wish i could buy a bigger bottle. I love this and it has made such a huge difference in my skin.",4.6,,
Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner,"Where has this been all my life? Immediately after using the discoloration of my face went down so much.

Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner,"I love TO products. I saw this new toner and was supposed to be milder than the glycolic acid toner, but after I used this, my skin felt rough and bumpy. I decided to return it and stick to the glycolic acid toner. My skin feels smooth again.",1,,

Natural Moisturizing Factors + PhytoCeramides Rich Moisturizer,I previously used the original Natural Moisturizing Factors moisturizer but it never fully got the job done for my skin.

Natural Moisturizing Factors + PhytoCeramides Rich Moisturizer,I have severely dry skin like I drink enough water so I was trying to find a product that would actually make me feel hydrated on the surface of my skin. Phytoceramides is the only ingredient that actually makes me feel hydrated on the top. I know other moisturizers that do it's job under the surface but sadly my skin doesn't really feel it. I will say this is more of a night time moisturizer. As for makeup I just usually put a thin layer of aquaphor under my makeup and it does the job. I recommend this to anyone who needs surface hydration on their skin.,1,,

It's so thick that it leaves an oily shine on your skin for hours after application. If I want to apply makeup after this moisturizer, I have to blot off the oil with a tissue. After using this for 15 days, I had many clogged pores, bumps, and acne. I have dry sensitive skin and although it did make my skin hydrated (I think), there are significantly more negative things this product did that made my skin worse. The Ordinary is known for its amazing formulas and clean ingredients, and this moisturizer missed the mark on both.",4.3,,

However, a hill that I will die on is that if you treat oily skin like dry skin then your skin will balance out and this product is a great start.

But I cannot recommend this enough!",1,,
100% Plant-Derived Squalane Skin and Hair Hydrator Serum,"I got this to moisturize my skin before makeup. I've tried multiple moisturizers but they just mess with the texture of my makeup even if I waited for it to absorb, or they'd make my skin get super greasy under my makeup after an hour regardless of how lightweight the moisturizer was. I wanted something super lightweight that felt natural and wouldn't affect my makeup. You only need 2-3 drops for the whole face, it feels like it doesn't spread far cause its so thin but trust me it does. If you use more it'll leave you oily. It takes about 5-10mins to absorb but once it does it feels completely natural like your skin but hydrated. I blot my face once it absorbs to get any excess off. If you have oily skin you'll probably want the hyaluronic serum since that one is water based, I haven't tried it though.",5,,
100% Plant-Derived Squalane Skin and Hair Hydrator Serum,"This is a good alternative to oils for skin and hair. I bought it for my damaged skin barrier, but it works better for actual skin problems. It actually healed stabbed over skin in a day. I happened to use it on a wound that had a scab and the scab came off the next day with no bleeding and only light pink skin. I tried it soon after on a rug burn with the same result. Amazing. It also works to calm flyaways in my hair. Use lightly and not on roots.",5,,

I discovered this product after i completely destroyed my skin barrier and this stuff SAVED my skin!! I apply this as my second to last night time skincare routine, and follow it with CeraVe in the tub. You need to apply TO Squalane oil immediately after water based products , and BEFORE sunscreen or moisturizer. Applying this as the last step of a makeup routine is the dumbest thing i have read here. I guess if you want to take your makeup off, that would work. I have SUPER sensitive skin, as well as rosacea and TO squalane doesnt irritate me at all. It calms my skin down and reduces redness and dryness.",5,,
100% Plant-Derived Squalane Skin and Hair Hydrator Serum,The hemi-saline was amazing. It wasn't too heavy and worked particularly well for my hair. I LOVE it. I tried the squareness and it's way too thick and heavy. Please please bring back hemi-squalane even if you need to increase the price.,1,,
100% Plant-Derived Squalane Skin and Hair Hydrator Serum,"Nothing has ever provided a better moisture fix for my skin than this product. For several months now, I have used this twice a day as the finishing layer for my skincare routine. My skin looks and behaves so much better using this instead of a cream or lotion moisturizer. It can feel a bit oily going on if I'm too generous, but it absorbs quickly into my skin, leaving it so nicely hydrated. My makeup sits better, and it has helped control a couple of dry patches that have never stood down to anything else.",5,,

I have very problematic, flaky, acne prone, cloggged skin with seborrheic dermatitis. This is the first ""oil"" that hasn't broken me out, lays beautifully under makeup and is very soothing at night. 3 small drops is more than enough per application!!! Otherwise yes it will get oily. Haven't had any problems with pilling. I use it after cleansing and after my buffet serum (now called something else) and before my moisturizer. Excited for more positive results with continued usage ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5,,

No pilling!!! This is huge for me. I struggle with layering products and pilling.",4.6,,

Anti-Aging Retinoid Emulsion,"I bought this when I first started noticing fine lines around my mouth (age 26-27) and have used it about twice a week for the last 3-4 years. I've definitely noticed a reduction in the lines I was originally targeting. My forehead used to be textured and bumpy and is much smoother now. I'm happier with my skin at age 30 than I was in my mid-20s. My skincare routine is pretty minimal (wash face once a day, vitamin C serum twice a week, 30 spf cream every morning, this retinoid serum twice a week, and Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors every night) and I sometimes slack off on the vitamin C. I also rarely wear makeup, so my skin isn't reacting to different products all the time. That's all to say: there are very few competing factors at play in monitoring my skin's reaction to this serum over time and I believe it delivers consistent results at a good price. My skin looks so refreshed the morning after using this, as long as I get enough sleep. It's a good addition to a simple routine, but no one product is going to perform miracles. If you stay moisturized, wear sun protection, and get enough sleep, this serum will add that extra boost to help rejuvenate your skin. Also, I keep my serums in the fridge and usually stretch them past the 3 month mark.",5,,

Anti-Aging Retinoid Emulsion,"I bought this when I first started noticing fine lines around my mouth (age 26-27) and have used it about twice a week for the last 3-4 years. I've definitely noticed a reduction in the lines I was originally targeting. My forehead used to be textured and bumpy and is much smoother now. I'm happier with my skin at age 30 than I was in my mid-20s. My skincare routine is pretty minimal (wash face once a day, vitamin C serum twice a week, 30 spf cream every morning, this retinoid serum twice a week, and Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors every night) and I sometimes slack off on the vitamin C. I also rarely wear makeup, so my skin isn't reacting to different products all the time. That's all to say: there are very few competing factors at play in monitoring my skin's reaction to this serum over time and I believe it delivers consistent results at a good price. My skin looks so refreshed the morning after using this, as long as I get enough sleep. It's a good addition to a simple routine, but no one product is going to perform miracles. If you stay moisturized, wear sun protection, and get enough sleep, this serum will add that extra boost to help rejuvenate your skin. Also, I keep my serums in the fridge and usually stretch them past the 3 month mark.",5,,
Anti-Aging Retinoid Emulsion,I love love this product! But unfortunately my skin got used to it :( when is the 5% coming??? Please!,4.5,,
Anti-Aging Retinoid Emulsion,"One of my new HG! I started with using it twice a week, than 3 times a week. And now i use it everyday if i remember at night! I start with niacinamind, than this and than my moisturizer with some argon oil mixed in. And muah my face is glowinggggg",5,,
Anti-Aging Retinoid Emulsion,"Searched for awhile for a budget friendly, cruelty free retinol that worked for me. My skin purged for a couple weeks but now it glows. Fading my sun spots and acne scars. Helping with my cystic acne as well. Please never stop making this!",3,,

Anti-Aging Retinoid Emulsion,"I have been using this serum for 2 years now and i never want to go without it! As someone with sensitive and acne prone skin, this emulsion provides me some of the benefits of a retinol in a form that does not irritate my skin. I am 32 and have seen a reduction in fine lines and my skin is brighter. You cant beat the price either! An added bonus is that it absorbs quickly and doesnt just sit like an oil on top of the skin like some retinols i have tried. I am a huge fan of this product.",4.5,,
Anti-Aging Retinoid Emulsion,once I started using it there was no going back and it would've been more comfortable if the ordinary granactive retinoid 5% in squalane had also a formula in emulsion,5,,
Anti-Aging Retinoid Emulsion,"Every night that I use this, I wake up looking beautiful. Dark spots are lighter, texture is more smoother and plump. The formula feels smooth and creamy. And it melts right into my skin. I have been using this for years. I am 42 years old and I look about in my late 20s. And this is my secret lol",3,,
Anti-Aging Retinoid Emulsion,This is the only type of vitamin A that I can tolerate on my skin and I use it every other night. It's been about six weeks and I am seeing positive results. I hope this will always be available.,5,,
Balancing Serum for Blemish Prone Skin,"When I first applied it made my skin tingle, and itch very slightly but I still went with the flow and kept it on.

It works incredibly well under makeup and sunscreen ‚Äî no pilling whatsoever!! It also doesnt cause my skin to peel, get flaky, or feel dry and tight, which were common issues I've had with other products that claim to reduce oiliness. In my 30s, I have had new ongoing issues with acne along my jaw and chin. This is the only product that's helped reduce that issue completely when I use it consistently morning and night. Only a few drops are needed for my face (don't need a whole droppers' worth). About that smell‚Ä¶.I have an incredibly sensitive nose. It's unfortunately true that this product smells bad. It is not rancid, it just smells that way. I apply this product to my face, let it dry down for a minute or two, and then put my moisturizer on top. The odor dissipates a few minutes later after it dries/my skin absorbs the product, usually in less than 15 minutes. This serum works so well for me that I don't mind dealing with the odor.

I love The Ordinary so I grabbed this and crossed my fingers‚Ä¶my skin is changed in 2 weeks.

Balancing Serum for Blemish Prone Skin,"I received a bottle of The Ordinary Balancing and Clarifying Serum from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. It came in well packed and is already in a dropper bottle, making it easier to apply. This multiactive transparent solution is a mixture of fragmented molecules derived from the breakdown of bacteria lactococcus lactis. It helps minimize excess shine and reduce pores, while it hydrates and strengthen your skin barrier. This is fragrance free and is great for people with blemish prone skin. It's so easy to apply. After cleansing, put few drops on your face avoiding eyes. It is non greasy. It hydrates the skin well. It also helps improve your skin texture, giving you brighter, clearer, and fresher skin. I love this serum.",5,,
Balancing Serum for Blemish Prone Skin,"Used this for about a month daily as instructed. I noticed that it left a shiny film on my face during the day which some may like the ""dewy glow"" look it casts. I don't since I have naturally oily skin to begin with.

Balancing Serum for Blemish Prone Skin,"I often feel as though I have a somewhat shiny and pore-ridden face, so this product seemed like a pretty safe bet, reinforced by the fact that I implicitly trust pretty much anything from The Ordinary. This stuff is good too! I'm easy though, and haven't gotten a product I hate from the brand thus far; it does feel as though my pores are more manageable, and it's tough to tell if my skin has a more matte look yet, but the product does seem to be working for me.

And my skin is used to 1% retinol. My skin was also very sun sensitive, so sunscreen is a must. That being said, it's very effective, even after only one month. My skin has improved with less new acne, diminished old acne scars, and reduced fine lines, as well as evening my skin tone. The only downside to me is the price for the quantity, but I think it's still reasonable.

Now in month 5 (1 mth with step up to retinal) and I honestly don't think my skin has ever been this good. It's really clear, fresh, smooth, enlarged pores have reduced a lot, dark spots actually fading & some have gone completely! I have some very deep wrinkles but just recently I'm starting to see them smoothing out, too! I use niacinamide, matrixyl, HA moisturizer & SPF in the mornings (all work great together with no pilling), and niacinamide, buffet, retinal & HA in the PM. I've built up this routine gradually over the last few months and it's really paying off! I think patience and sticking to it is the key!

I found a pea size amount as recommended insufficient to spread a thin layer across face, front and back of neck. 5 pumps required for me. The colour. It will stain pillows and other white/light fabrics. That said, I am impressed with the results and shall continue to purchase this product.",5,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I alreday have around 3 weeks using this retinol, with a little amount you can see a smooth skin. Is a must have for your skin care rutine. The package is very lightweight",4.3,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I love the way this product feels! It only takes a small amount to be effective! I have used it for about a month and can already feel my neck becoming tighter!,4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I have used the Ordinary priducts for years the Grandaction .20 formula and decided to try this one. It has really pumped up my facial line in addition to making my skin so smooth and satiny feeling definitely will keep this one.,2,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"Anyone giving this a bad review is using it wrong. You only need a pea size drop for the whole face and are supposed to use it one to two times a week. This product has made a landslide difference in my skin care. At first I was not seeing results with the ordinary products but decided to just do the suggested regime and added a few products. After using the line for a few weeks I have seen a drastic difference in my skin as a whole and will never go back to my old routine. Rather then seeing just temporary changes I'm seeing permanent real change in my pores, density, elasticity and the glow! Take the time to look up instructions on each product it makes a difference.",5,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"Had 3 uses of this product, and could not expel more out of the tube. I even took the top off to see if this was really all of the product. For the price, I got 3 small sized pumps (about a pea size for reference). Very disappointed, buyer beware.",5,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I had hormonal acnes that formed around my chin area. After using this product in 3 days, I found all acnes were completely vanished. It is highly recommended and I am super happy with the result. So thankful I found this with affordable proce but with fabulous outcome. Thanks the Ordinary. You are supposed to be the Extra Ordinary.",4.3,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I received this product for free from Influenster and The Ordinary in exchange for my honest review. I have been really enjoying this The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulsion. I've noticed after a few weeks that my pores seem to be smaller and those little fine lines have started to smooth out. It absorbs nicely into my skin. I did deal with a bit of overdrying for the first week or two but now it's an affordable part of my skin care routine.,4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,The packaging is the worst I've ever come across in my life. Nothing came out and I had to cut the entire tube open to get anything out.,2,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I really didn't see much of a difference it's supposed to be a lightning and tightening serum and I used it for over a month every other day for about a month and I didn't see much difference I definitely would not buy this it's very creamy and absorbs right into your skin it does make your skin a little bit dry and the areas you put it in it has no smell it's unscented and I do like the little bottle that it comes in,5,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I am 47 and had pronounced forehead lines from frowning. Retinol serum was working well to reduce the lines. Then I tried this. One application and my lines have reduced so dramatically I look 20 years younger! No sensitivity at all but did apply another brand of HA serum first and plenty of moisturiser afterwards. Highly recommend!! In shock tbh haha!,5,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"my new favourite retinoid. results are noticeable. I have relatively sensitive skin, use the product pretty liberally, and have had no adverse reactions.",4.3,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I received a free product of The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulation for my honest review from The Ordinary and Influenster. After a few weeks of usage i've notced my pores are looking smaller! I'm in my mid 40's so I do have some fine lines and the Ordinary is helping smooth them out some. This definitely made my skin look more even. The ordinary has great affordable products.,4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I appreciate Influenster sending me this complimentary product to review in exchange for my honest opinion. For starters, a little goes a long way and it's nice to have a non scented product, especially for sensitive skin. Price also seems reasonable, once I did some product research. Not blow away, but not bad.",2,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"Effective smooths skin after prescribed use. My skin is soft, smooth and glowing just after several weeks of usage (literally used once a week for 2 weeks and then twice in one week). A little goes a long way. Perfect for low maintenance skincare for aging skin. (I'm in my mid-late 40s). Please remember to not use on sensitive areas.",5,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I really like this product. I swapped from an expensive retinal product to this and they are similar in results... but the yellow tone is very strong and gets left in my hair line and eyebrows. Its also transfered to my white pillow case too. Good product but better to use less liberally.,5,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I've used this consistently for weeks now on my very sensitive, dry/combo skin - it's the best I've tolerated any form of retinol/retinal so far! It does tingle a bit when I put it on & my skin is a bit more sensitive on nights when I use it/the day after, BUT when I wake up in the morning after putting it on, my skin looks juicy, plump & fresh. Much more so than when I just use the other products in my routine!",4.3,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I enjoyed first off that there was not a harsh chemical smell as I have found on several other products. This goes on smooth and doesn't have a tacky feel to it. I did notice a slight difference in the fine lines and would just need to use this more to see a bigger difference. I received this produce at no cost in exchange for my honest review.,4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I'm have been fan of ordinary, for a while and using 5% Retinol. So, I switch to the Retinal 0.2 Great product. But be careful using it everyday if you don't want a peeling mask. I made the mistake because there no irritation",2,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I have never used a retinal emulsion prior to this one. However, after using for almost a month, I am a huge fan. Goes on about without feeling sticky. My skin has noticeably improved texture and diminished fine lines. There was very little scent to the product which I also loved. I don't think you can beat this product at this price point.",4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,This product goes on smooth without a smell. However not sure if it does what it says. I didn't see any fading of dark spots or wrinkles probably wouldn't purchase again,4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,This is a great retinol product. I love the consistency of it and how light it feels on the skin. It did not make me purge and I did see some improvement when using it.,4.3,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"This product is great and I would definitely reccomend to anybody looking for an affordable retiniod! After aboir two weeks of usage i've notced my pores are so much smaller! I'm in my early 20s so this is meant to be preventative, so I'm not totally sure about lines, but this definitely made my skin look more even. No purging stage for me either!",4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,Love love love this new ordinary product! Definitely noticed a difference in my skin after just a few applications! I will be adding this to my skin care regimen!,2,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I used this retinol serum on my melanin skin for a month. It was light weight and applied smooth. The texture felt great. It had no hard ordor or scent. It works effectively and left my skin feeling young and smooth.,4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I brought this about 2 week ago and have used it 3 times. Makes my face yellow and transferred to my pillowcases.,5,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,The Ordinary Retinal Emulsion cream has improved the look of my facial skin over the last 4 weeks. It is a light moisturizer cream that doesn't really have much of a scent. The pump bottle is nice to control the amount used because it doesn't take a lot of product to cover the entire face. The elasticity of my skin is improving and the texture of my skin is smoother. This cream did dry my face out at first but over time that seemed to improve.,4.3,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"Unreal! This serum is incredibly effective in evening out my skin tone, improving my skin texture and just making the overall appearance clearer and brighter. It feels light and smooth and absorbs immediately. Love it and will purchase when I run out.",4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"This is the gentlest retinol product I've ever used, which is nice for my sensitive skin. It doesn't absorb perfectly on its own though, you have to be really aware of getting every bit of it rubbed in.",2,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I've never used a retinal emulsion so I had no idea what to expect. However, after using this once to twice a week for about a month, my skin definitely has improved texture and my fine lines have diminished. And please don't let the yellow color turn you away, this retinal is fantastic. Affordable and effective. Yes yes yes.",4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I was really excited to receive this product because I have not used this brand before, but I've heard wonderful things .Unfortunately, I couldn't use this product more than once because it made my skin breakout and burn. The product seemed to be kind of greasy and didn't absorb well on my skin. within about 10 minutes my face was burning and I had to wash it off. My skin is not sensitive but I did have a problem with this product. unfortunately, due to my experience I would not recommend this product to others.",5,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"The product absorbs quickly. After the second week of using it as instructed (that's only twice in 2 weeks), I noticed my dark spots from old acne cysts looked lighter. The product is very effective. However, it made my face dry so I use a hydration booster serum before applying it. Works well for me this way. I would definitely recommend!",4.3,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I've been a big fan of The Ordinary for a long time. I'm 47 and desperately trying to keep my skin in good shape. This is another great product in their lineup. It's effective for an OTC products and has a great price point.,4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I priced improvements on the texture of my skin as well as my skin started to feel smoother as I kept using it it did not break me out or irritated my skin thankfully during my use of the product I did not notice any significant fragrance in the product,2,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"Overall, I feel that this is an excellent beginner retinal cream that's also super affordable. And although there is a yellow tint, it blends completely. I use at night and have noticed more hydrated and softer skin.",4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I have been using this retinal for almost a month, 6 days per week and it has been amazing , love the yellow that comes with it, my skin looks much better and the tone is amazing. love this serum , thanks ordinary =)",3,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I did notice some slight improvement in fine lines. I think with more regular use I could see further results. It goes on smooth without leaving residue. I did not have any negative side effects. I only had a concern regarding the off putting yellow color of the product.,4.3,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,This helped my skin feel smoother and helped with some smaller breakout problems I've been having. It helped even out my skin texture. Also my skin is super sensitive and this didn't irritate it. It felt smooth and light and didn't leave my skin feeling oily or sticky.,4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,This is a great option for an affordable retinol product. It does the same thing as more expensive brands. I had no negative reactions to skin while using this. There is no scent which I like.,2,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I received a sample size to try and as everyone knows you can not really get a good feel for skincare in samples. There's no miracle, works the very first time, cure all product. So I've been giving this my best go. I only applied weekly as instructed since I'm newer to retinols and do tend to be sensitive. I didn't have enough to work up to more than that. A pea size was all that was needed and it went on nicely, no immediate irritation and my skin felt smooth. In the morning my cheeks were redder than usual and after washing my face and doing my makeup I noticed only the days I had used this the night before, my makeup wouldn't sit well. It was separating and my pores seemed larger. My skin was softer though but a little dry although I already have dry skin. I feel over time my skin would adapt and it would be a good addition to my routine and luckily it won't break the bank either.",4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,This is a great option for an affordable retinol product. It does the same thing as more expensive brands. I had no negative reactions to skin while using this. There is no scent which I like.,5,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I have sensitive skin & have had some serious issues with retinal in the past. This is the first retinal I've been able to use over a long period of time that didn't cause me to have skin issues. The product itself goes on smoothly like a lightweight lotion and is at a great price point compared to other retinal options. Since it wasn't as harsh as others, I feel it took longer for results. But I'd honestly rather have that than red and painful skin.",4.3,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I'm definitely beginning to see the difference underneath my eyes. I noticed my dark under eye is becoming lighter after a couple weeks of using. It was easy to apply and it blended will with my moisturizer. I even see a glow after such a short time of using. I can't wait to see the result after a few months of using.,4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,This retinal from the ordinary has the perfect strength for me it has helped with my fine lines and wrinkles. it does not make my skin too sensitive. I really have enjoyed it. I recommend it for anyone who needs help with their fine lines and wrinkles. You may want to just use it once weekly at first. i use it twice a week.,2,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"This eye cream provides smoothness and hydration. While my main concerns are dark circles and under-eye dryness, I've noticed improvement in a short period of time since using this product. I'm excited to see even more improvement with continued use.",4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I was pleased with the performance of this product. It wasn't massive, but my face looked a bit more fresh in the morning after use. The texture and scent were reasonable and I didn't feel tacky, oily or sticky.",5,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"So this retinol serum was not it for me. Everything seemed fine at first, but soon my skin became dry and flaky, especially near my eyebrows. Other than that, I did not notice any difference. When I stopped using it, my skin returned to normal. I don't think this is a problem specific to this product, as I've tried other retinol products in the past and gotten similar results. Because of this, I cannot recommend this product. Also, the sickly yellow color was really off-putting.",4.3,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,Awesome packaging and no intense scent. Goes well with other products. Love the way it makes my skin feel great addition to my skin care routine.,4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I received this product few in exchange for my honest opinion. I feel like The Ordinary brand is a little underrated overall. I use a couple of their products in my daily routine so I was excited to try. I love that it isn't too harsh and there's not a strong scent. There's no scent at all to me. I feel like I need more time to know the long term effects but so far so good. I would definitely recommend if you are a little on the sensitive or reactive side.,2,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I would definitely buy this again! It's a brand I already trust, and it simply works! I like the packaging. The cream has a yellow tint and does tint your skin so I recommend using it only at night. It did dry my skin out but that's from the retinol and to be expected.",1,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I'm surprised how smooth this emulsion is with a very pleasant smell. Not sure I used it long enough to see a complete change but I will continue to use,5,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I received The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulsion face and neck cream about four weeks ago. I used it once.per week the first two weeks and then once every three days the second two weeks. Th cream is yellow in color and it's easy to blend and dries or absorbs pretty quickly. It does not leave an oily look or a greasy residue on your skin. A very little bit goes a long way, around a pea sized amount is enough to do your whole face and neck one time . I cannot say definitively that it produced any results that were good or bad. I honestly did not notice a change in my complexion or texture or otherwise, aside from one thing. After applying it, approximately 2 hours later, my skin gets a bit red. Also, for thirty minutes after applying it, I get a warm and tingly, almost hot sensation, on my face. I read that it is normal to experience some peeling and changes in skin texture, but I'm pretty sure that is only the first few times of use. I don't know, but this product, unlike the majority of other skin care products, my results have been uncertain and indefinite.",4.3,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"I have been using this product consistently for the last three weeks and I love it! I'm in my mid-40's and this seems to be one product that I actually see results from - and so quickly too. I know retinols tend to be harsh, but my skin is generally sensitive and I've had no issues at all. I also tend to still get acne pretty frequently, and this product helped reduce the texture from those old acne bumps. It's not scented, but there is a bit of an earthly smell to it. Not too bad. Overall, it's 100% a product I will repurchase again and again.",4,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,I love how this makes my skin feel! After using it for a few weeks now I can tell a big difference in my skin. I hope it will continue to improve my skin even more!,2,,
The Ordinary Retinol 0.2% In Squalane,"After using the product a few times, my skin did not react well. I had to discontinue the use of it. I don't normally have reactions to products, so it was a bit concerning.",3,,
Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,"First if all, it legit smells like diarrhea. I generally like doing vit C in the morning and retinol at night but this is not to be worn under makeup. It made my skin so oily which is fine while im sleeping since i have dry skin anyways. I don't like the gritty texture and am afraid of micro tears in my skin it's so gritty. Seriously not sure what they were thinking when they discontinued other vit C products and gave us this instead.",3.4,,

Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,"This is a stable form vitamin of C. It's grainy because of the C crystals. It will absorb eventually. I am so happy to have found this! I hope it doesn't get discontinued, it's a great buy if you need C for repair.",2,,

Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,"This is the only vitamin C product that has worked for me and I absolutely love it. The texture is a little gritty but I only use it at bedtime. Also, I wait a while before layering the next product/serum so there's not a problem with them clumping together. For those who prefer a smoother texture, the Ordinary makes Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone. I tried that one as well but I prefer this one with HA Sphere 2%. The Ordinary is the best. I use several of their products, they are very affordable.",5,,
Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,"I didn't mind the grittiness but the smell was horrible, I don't like putting anything that smells gross on my face. I didn't read any other reviews about the smell so maybe I just got a defective product? regardless, had to stop using and threw it away.",1,,
Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,"Had to throw it away, it was grainy and it wouldn't dissolve",1,,
Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,Absolutely love this serum! It is a gritty texture and takes some time for your skin to get used to. My skin texture was great in a few weeks! 10/10 recommend using it at night though. The texture is not compatible to be applied under makeup,5,,
Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,This isnt a luxurious lotion to wear under make up- i have dark spots and textured skin- i will use this at night and wake up with smoother more refreshed skin almost like the gritty texture helps remove dead skin. Its a process I have been using for months and continue to purchase ü•π,3.4,,
Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,Ordinary products are great. It works. Noone believes my age. I also use pycnogenol and Noone in the store seems to know what it is. Love it along with argeline niacinamide 10 . Plus others. Works for me no lines or wrinkles at 73.,5,,
Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,"I have and use this product as an intensive treatment for pigmentation/dark splotches. IT IS NOT A DAYTIME UPKEEP VITAMIN C TO USE UNDER MAKEUP. It GETS RESULTS and I highly recommend it. I don't want this product to disappear because of unclear instructions. I use this 2x a month to keep the melasma away from my face and body. Yes it's grainy, that's the encapsulated vitamin C which keeps it from degrading! Yes it will sting like crazy, start off by diluting it a bit with a waterbased product and work up. Use it as a nighttime intensive and watch your dark spots disappear.",1,,
Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% Serum,"I had read previous reviews about this product and decided to try it for myself. Directions suggest using it at night, because it has a very sandy texture. I see this as a good thing, because it seems to smooth out the rough spots. Each morning my skin looks better and more glowing. I've been using it for a little more than a week. The only negative to the product is its smell, which is awful, perhaps because the company doesn't use fragrance, which could irritate the skin. Other than that I would buy it again, since it's very affordable.",5,,

Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I love this product. I was introduced to lactic acid through a much pricier serum (Good Genes) and I couldn't justify the price. I tried this on a whim and it works better for me than a product that's literally 10x the price. The formula is not elegant. it's a very watery serum that doesn't have the greatest smell. More than once I've knocked the open bottle and lost a bit of product, but at least it's incredibly affordable! I have dry, mature, slightly sensitive skin. I can't use glycolic acid without irritation, and I've found lactic acid is a great option for me because it's hydrating in addition to exfoliating. I regularly get a fair bit of superficial dryness and this product clears up the flakiness literally overnight without further drying/dehydration or irritation. I use this 2-3x per week, alternating with the days I use tret.",3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I use adap. every night but thought maybe I should add some sort of peel to my routine. After a week of using this (in the morning because i use adap. at night) my face was so oily and I started breaking out. It says you can use every day so that's what I did but I realized doing that, it destroyed my skin barrier. So I healed my skin barrier and used this just once at night (and not use my adap. that night). And again, my face broke out and I had oily clogged pores. Took this out of my routine and now my face is normal and clear. Definitely not worth it. This is the third product by the ordinary I've used and haven't been particularly happy with any of their products",5,,

The light exfoliation property has eliminated the dry skin that caused those very defined lines in the past. I have now been buying this religiously. I get compliments on my smooth complexion and I always give the credit to this product. The bottle lasts a long time too!",5,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I don't know what exactly it was, bc I've never had sensitivity before to lactic acid, but this gave me horrible contact dermatitis. My face is covered in bumps, it's extremely dry, red, itchy, and burns. The only thing that is helping right now is Aquaphor and Bag Balm. I can't even put sunscreen on",2,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I have combination skin, and this acid helps to keep my pores clean and clear.",4.3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I have a rough and bumpy dark patch on the lower left side of my chin. I applied this lactic acid to the patch nightly and slowly but surely it lightened, smoothed, and has all but disappeared. I have a dry patch on one of my elbows that I've started to apply it to at night and it has removed the dry patch there as well. Very happy with the results.",5,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,I bought this Lactic acid but am a bit confused. It says: 'Use once a day ideally in PM' (but doesnt say for how long). I assumed the above meant leave on overnight but then it also says 'contact of the product must be for limited duration or frequency' which suggests a quick duration i.e. 15 minutes and wash off as id say overnight was not limited duration ? Reviews say leave on. Google says dont leave lactic acid on skin for longer than 15 minutes. My brain is boggled - help ..,3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"Not bad, it's way better for acne than the hyaluronic acid and doesn't make me break out more or ruin my skin barrier.",5,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I bought this almost a year ago and I still find myself going to the internet to try and understand it. PLEASE put more instructions on your packaging. Also, how does everyone avoid ripping off their fingerprints when applying?",5,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I have been using this product nightly for 4 months. First of all, I've hardly made a dent in the bottle. You get a lot of good product for a very reasonable price. Secondly, your skin will purge at first and get a little irritated and red (I have sensitive skin). However, with continued use: your fines lines are less visible, your pores are absolutely cleared OUT - no dark spots even with sebaceous filaments, your skin GLOWS. I cleanse nightly with an oil cleanser (oil dissolves oil), then a clay or salicylic acid cleanser to reduce pore size. I then apply this product under a good moisturizer. It is very watery, so be careful where you apply because it runs. Rub it in really well for best results, really get it in there before you apply moisturizer. I am very impressed, and I spent 1/10th of what I expected to see these results. Switched almost completely to this brand, have not had a bad experience with any product.",4.3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,The only exfoliator I've ever used is retinol and I was liking it but it wasn't giving me the exact results I needed anymore. I got this and within one use I noticed a difference. My skin is a lot smoother and my closed comedones have shrunk and are on their way out. This is an acid so don't use it with other acids or retinol because it could be too harsh for your skin. I had no problems with using it full strength right away. I only apply at night and use SPF in the morning.,5,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,This product is a lifesaver for my sensitive reactive mature skin. I use this and then put a light gel mositurizer over it every evening. I have seen a great difference in my skin overall. Seems like it works well on hrominal acne. I have been using this for about 4 months now and no reactions‚Ä¶I will use this forever!,3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I've only been using it for 2 weeks, but I think it's working pretty well. It's definitely diminishing the bumps I get all over my forehead. Will keep using.",5,,

Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,Literally the best lactic serum I have used in my 6 years of skincare. We need a 120ml because the 30ml only lasts about a week or 2 of usage.,4.3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,This product was given to me as a gift a year ago and am obsessed..I can't live without!,5,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,Extoliates gently and works immediately! Now a staple in my weekly skincare routine. Eats away dead skin snd gunk immediately and helps to keep my skin clear. I struggle with hormonal acne and acne likely caused/worsened from my makeup and The Ordinary's chemical exfoliators are always a godsend. Lactic acid is gentler than the AHA/BHA one and can be used more times during a week which is gentler snd helps keep my skin clear. Love it! And will never fo without it!,3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,I rub it on my face and neck and leave it on for an hour then I wipe it off with a damp cloth then I put on serum and moisturizer,5,,

Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"Simple formulation that does a nice job exfoliating while and plumping up the skin. I use this maybe once a twice a week, a small drop at night time only, after cleanse and a hydrating serum, topping with a light moisturiser in winter months. I find my skin smoother and firmer in the morning after using this. Of course, it's important not to exaggerate (not to use too much or too frequently), and to follow with barrier repairing skincare and sun protection.",5,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I have purchased this product multiple times. It works overnight to give you smooth, hydrated, and glowy skin in by the morning.",3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,Ive used this product for a week now and am happy with the results. It is way less irritating that AHA/BHA on my skin.,5,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,I started using this a year or so ago and now I can't go without it! It helps to keep my skin feeling smooth and healthy!,4,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,It kinda burns when putting on and Ig bc it's an acid and stuff but yeah idk. I dont use it rlly often it said it helps with texture a little but I haven't seen any difference tbh. I mean at least its not expensive?,4.3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,The first night I wore this I was amazed in the morning. My skin is aging and doesn't bounced back like it used to. I will be using this every evening. My son is 15 and even notices results in the morning.,5,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,Totally clears up the KP on my cheeks. So glad a salesperson at Ulta recommended it!,3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,I have been using the Lactic Acid 10% +HA for around a month now and my skin feels so hydrated and smooth. I actually noticed the difference the first time I used it. Little bumps on my forhead dissapeared in a week and my skin was really smooth. I use this under a mosturiser at night and my skin feels very hydrated.,1,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I bought this about a month ago and hoped it would work‚Ä¶. It has! It's surpassed all of my expectations! Background: I have KP (keratosis pilaris) and I have tried everything on the market to get rid of a few problem areas on my arms and around my knees. None of the expensive creams, soaps, exfoliators, or scrubs have worked. I've even tried home remedies! I applied a dropper full to each area that was bumpy & rough after each shower for 3 weeks and the bumps are gone!!!! I'm going to keep this on hand forever! Thank you The Ordinary! I have the smoothest skin I've ever had in my entire life! Love!",5,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I have dry, sensitive skin & this serum burns like crazy. I've tried it off & on for a couple of months, but am just going to give it away & let someone else see if it works for them.",4.3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"Ordinary has a ton of great products that are super affordable and you get quite a bit of product. I apply this lactic acid at night after cleansing my face, it absorbs quickly. After about 5 mins when it's fully absorbed I'll apply a heavy nighttime moisturizer. Within 3 weeks my skin was appearing brighter, smoother and glowy. I alternate this in my night time routine with retinol. One day lactic, next day retinol.",5,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I don't have a review yet, as I just purchased a bottle of the Lactic Acid exfoliating serum today. I'm a bit confused as to how this should be used. Is this a treatment that you leave on for a few minutes (or 10, 15 minutes?) and then wash off? Or, do you apply it after cleansing and leave it on?",3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I was very excited to get this product and did plenty of research on how to apply it properly, however it started breaking me out within only two weeks of usage. I have relatively dry skin and when I started using the product, I had one or two small bumps on my forehead that I had plans on clearing up. However, after using this product at night, I had multiple red bumps popping up on my forehead and cheeks. I'm too afraid to use it now, and I'm very disappointed.",1,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I used this product hoping to exfoliate and brighten skin. Before, I only had a few blackheads on my nose, but this caused break outs which I never had before. After almost 2 months, I finally stopped using it. Caused a slight burning sensation as well. I am still struggling to get rid of the continous break outs is caused‚Ä¶",5,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,It's said to apply daily which I did (in the PM) and my skin got terrible - 2 times more breakouts and red colour of the skin. I stopped using after 2 weeks. Waste of money.,4.3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"I started using this product on the night of 7th June, it is a month now. My skin smoothened out in two weeks, it's brighter and clearer.

Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"The product worked okay, really have seen no difference though.",3,,
Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2% Exfoliating Serum,"My skin type is oily for the most part, but I still get a bit of skin that needs sloughed off. This product acts as a gentle exfoliant on dry, dead skin. And I love that no micro beads or gritty scrub are required - this makes exfoliating your face so easy! I use this serum once or twice a week, and I always notice a difference in the smoothness of my skin and overall tone & radiance. I'd highly recommend this serum!",1,,
Natural Moisturizing Factors + Beta Glucan Gel Moisturizer,"This is a GEL not a cream moisturizer. I missed that word on the package when I purchased it, haha.

Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I love this product and can really see the difference it has made to my hyperpigmentation. However, I find it impossible to finish a bottle within the 6 months usage period, even though I use a generous amount twice a day, which seems terribly wasteful. Surely it would be better to produce a smaller sized bottle or increase the stability of the product so that it lasts longer than 6 months? Not a complaint, just a suggestion :-)",2,,

Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I've never written a review, yet here I am. This stuff has transformed my skin. I read that combining this form of vitamin C with Niacinamide does wonderful things. I have SUPER sensitive and acne prone skin (in my 60s!!). Within 3 days (no joke), my skin looked brighter and plumper. Since I started using this (over a month now), I have had zero (ZERO!) acne. I hope it continues and my skin won't ""adjust"" to its old, former self. WOW, just WOW. I find it feels oily even though it states it is water based, so I put the niacinamide on first, then this, then my spf moisturizer. Did I say WOW?!!!",5,,

Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I am very low maintenance with my skincare but have benefited from a Vit C derivative, I do find I'm lovely and bright looking afterwards but I'm really not keen on the texture afterwards, it's quite tacky and taut, so great if you want that skin-tightening feel but it's not my favourite texture, I feel maybe a moisturiser like HA could be added in the formula...

Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I use tretinoin for acne and anti-aging and if you're also using tret you're aware of how other skincare products don't always play nice with it. My experience with The Ordinary's Pycnogenol was a disaster and I wonder why I ever strayed from this. It's gentle on the skin, helps with sun damage and hyperpigmentation, and pairs well with Tretinoin. Unlike l-ascorbic acid serums its also very stable and DOESN'T SMELL. Every L-AA serum I've used smelled weird, like hot dog water (it isn't just the ferulic acid often incorporated into it). I just CANT deal with the hot dog water smell and this thankfully has no scent.",2,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I have tried so many Vitamin C (LAA and Ascorbic Acid) but always stings and burn anything that is above 10% until the day i found The Ordinary Absorbyl Glucoside.

My face glows every morning since i use it day and night from using it for about a month. You may not like it because it's not LAA or AA but this serum did manage to keep my skin happy, glowy and non irritant. Would love to purchase it again once the bottle finish. Thank you for making me feel much more confident with myself.",3,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,This quickly became one of my holy grail skincare items! Within a few weeks of using I noticed my dark spots fading (and I had a good number of them due to acen) and my friends were commenting on how dewey and glowing my skin was looking. I apply every morning after a hyaluronic toner and right before my moisturizer. I have had no issues with lack of absorption or pilling. 10/10!,5,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"This one is by far my favorite Ordinary product. I'm in my 30s and have combination skin (mostly dull and dry, but sometimes oily) that likes to break out from pretty much anything. I use this product with the HA moisturizer and not only it does not break me out- any breakouts from other products somehow heal faster. And my face doesn't look like i'm stuck in a never-ending hangover when I wake up in the morning. I've tried Buffet and Copper Peptide serums before and Ascorbyl Glucoside wins.",4.2,,

I've spent the past year building up how often I apply it, from once a week all the way to 5 times a week and it's just not comfortable any more. I have extremely dry skin and ever since I started the new bottle a week ago my skin has felt dry, itchy and tight. Maybe the ingredients have changed? Or the manufacturing process? Whatever it is I'm hesitant to keep using it. I'm going back to once a week and will see what happens.",5,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I have tried this product off and on whilst looking for a regime for my sensitive / oily / acne / rosacea prone skin. I am a pale caucasian 28 year old female and this product does not irritate my skin and leaves my face glowing and looking hydrated. I use it at night under azelaic acid. I am yet to try it under my supergoop mineral spf and under makeup. I just wish there was more scientific evidence on the effects of anti aging (wrinkling and fine lines) Anyway, good luck out there everyone!! Xx",2,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"Texture is easy to spread. No scent, not sticky after feel. My moisturizer SPF lotions spreads smoothly. Just started using this specific product, will await to see any results. Have been using this brand (different products) for about 2 years.",5,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I've used this product for months now, this will be my third bottle. I love it so much! Acne pigmentation disappears so quick and my skin feels amazing!",2,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,I love this stuff and refuse to ever run out!,4.2,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,I've been using this product consistently for the past year and have really noticed a reduction in my skin's hyperpigmentation from acne scarring. I can't use traditional vitamin c products due to sensitivity and perioral dermatitis but this is the only product my skin absolutely loves! I think it works amazing as a vitamin c for those with sensitive skin.,5,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I bought this product a few months ago after switching from the 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder. I switched to the Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% as it is an indirect Vitamin C product which allowed me to combine it with a lot of other products. I have definitely noticed my skin becoming clearer in terms of texture and become more radiant, less dull. I will continue to use this product. If you have oily or normal skin, I would recommend this product. If you have dry skin like my fiance, I would recommend the Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution 20% in Vitamin F. Please remember you can't use this with Niacinamide products.",2,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"The product gives an instant glow thanks to a layer of shine. I don't know how to describe it, so I put a picture of my hand, where you can see the edges of the product. The product ist completely dry on the picture! I really like the shine even though I feel like it gets lost after I apply my moisturizer. Anyhow the layer might feel odd to some. Personally I don't mind it and the feeling also goes away after applying moisturizer",5,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I'm using this product for more than 6 months now, and all I can say is that it really works! It makes my skin look bright and plumpe, and the hyperpigmentation is gone!",5,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,The smell is really not mine..it smells allfull like old cleaning rags..but the skin looks hydrated and there is a good glow.,4.2,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,You know how you drink a LOT of water and it makes your skin look all luminescent? This had the exact same effect. My skin looked so healthy and bright! I swear my face looked like it was actually sparkling.,5,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,This product changed my life my face has 0 pimples or bumps and my skin tone is even and smooth,2,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I got this for free for my birthday from a store, ive been wanting a vitamin c serum for a while cause i heard and read good things about it for skin care. Ive been using it for less than a week and i love it, my skin looks great so far",4,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I wanted to like this so badly, but I should've listened to the reviews saying ""you get what you pay for."" The product does not go on smoothly, I personally didn't see any benefits after use, and it clumped upon application. I do LOVE The Ordinary, but this one just was not it. It didn't do any harm or aesthetic damage to my skin so I don't want to give it one star.",5,,

Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,I have been using it since months. AM PM. I keep my routine simple with a cleanser serum sunscreen n Moisturizer. I wanted to use only this one to see if it helps with the claims they make. Nothing. Literally no difference at all. I am highly disappointed :(,5,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I had pretty low expectations but this gives such a great glow, I feel confident going without makeup",2,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,I have been using this product for almost 3 years now and it is very effective at fading my discoloration from acne and brightening my skin. I definitely recommend this product.,1,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I've been trying different products from The Ordinary to brighten and even out my skin tone. I'm in my 50s with combination sensitive skin. This product caused a lot of redness and irritation on my upper cheeks. I didn't get to use more than two weeks. I tried to skip a day, and then use sparingly, but gave up as I was having to cover redness that I never had before, and it immediately went away when I stopped this. Disappointing and a waste of money. If you have sensitive skin be careful.",1,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"Works wonders! not sticky, absorbs quickly, does not irritate, does not stain clothing, 10/10 product! My skin is radiant! removed all my old acne dark spots",4.2,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,I had a bad reaction to the niacinimide zinc BUT this is saving my skin from the dark spots + scars! I use it before moisturizer and it doesn't feel sticky.,5,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,Definitely saw a difference in the brightening if my skin after consistent use. This is a budget friendly product as well.,2,,
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% Serum,"I needed a new Vit C serum and thought I'd give this a try. So far (1 week) it hasn't caused any breakouts, and my skin looks and feels good when I apply this. I def see a freshness in my skin tone and my pores appear smaller. (it's also a rare cold front in FL- so that is a side affect of cool non-humid weather) Overall, I'm happy and would re-purchase this if I ran out next week!",5,,
100% Cold Pressed Virgin Marula Oil,I have mild eczema & ocassional breakouts on my back & shoulders. Also have seborrheic dermatitis on mt scalp.

100% Cold Pressed Virgin Marula Oil,"It's a dense oil that disappears once applied. 2 drops is enough to cover my face and makeup goes on smoothly over it. I've stopped using lotions because the added emulsifiers cause breakouts. Pure oils don't cause problems and they add a healthy glow to my skin. This is heavier than coconut oil, yet it leaves less residue. Time will tell if it improves my skins texture.",5,,
100% Cold Pressed Virgin Marula Oil,"I get super bad eczema and dry skin especially when I'm stressed or the seasons change (so now) and the skin around my eyes gets really weird and dry to the point where it's painful.

100% Cold Pressed Virgin Marula Oil,"I haven't tried this on my skin yet, but I have awful dry hair and scalp. And oh boy is this little cutie my new best friend, it leaves my poor hair feeling nice and shiny, it doesn't feel or look oily. Couldn't expect anything else from the ordinary.

100% Cold Pressed Virgin Marula Oil,"Love this product and sadly spilled about half a bottle so am re-buying. It gives a great non-greasy shine to my very long, thick and dry hair, making the dry ends feel healthy. If I had short or fine hair I would only use this as a treatment i.e. before washing - you would still get oiliness at the root like any other hair oil. I also use it for facial massage and it feels so hydrating. It has a light but still oily feel. If you don't like oil textures, this may not be for you; if you do, this product is ideal. I've used every kind of pure oil under the sun on my face and this has the best texture. I've never broken out from using this product.",5,,
100% Cold Pressed Virgin Marula Oil,"The packaging, the product, the price - I cannot say enough about this product. I am 48 with fine lines, large pores, combo skin with redness. I live in a cold climate, using this oil after washing is the best thing ever. Low odor, quality oil, little goes a long way. I use the dropper to drop a dime to nickel size of oil and rub my hands together; I then pat it evenly over my face and neck/decolletage. This oil is quickly absorbed and does not leave me oily; it works great under different kinds of makeup and other products. I would recommend and repurchase.",3,,
100% Cold Pressed Virgin Marula Oil,Ive used this product before and its completely different now. It smells like crayon and is thicker than it used to be. Will be returning,5,,

Glycolipid Cream Facial Cleanser,"I like this cleanser and I feel like it works well for my sensitive combo acne prone skin. It leaves my skin feeling soft and not stripped.

Glycolipid Cream Facial Cleanser,"This is my go-to facial cleanser. I have very sensitive skin. The glycolipid cleanser is lightweight, and fragrance free (which is great) and cleans my face very well without stripping oils or drying it out.

I also very rarely get breakouts now, which is also a plus. I'm so happy I found the brand.",1,,

That and it smells like coconut to me, I was afraid it would smell rancid like some reviews claim but it just smells like a natural coconut, maybe coconut milk? Anyway I am mot the most consistent with my skincare but this cleanser doesnt dry me out, creamy cleansers are recommended for people with fry and sensitive skin so I had a feeling it would be okay on me. I do have concerns about it being too gentle? Like it doesnt cleanse like i need it to? But if you're someone who needs something gentle and soothing is this for you ;)",4.3,,
Niacinamide 5% Face and Body Emulsion,I have been using this for a few weeks now almost everyday & I do see progress! It almost smells like sweet donut. The application is milky smooth and doesn't leave a sticky residue. I'm almost out and will go ahead and order another one!,5,,

Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,"Some of the reviews claim that this serum causes breakouts. The purpose of this serum is to decongest so it purges any access sebum from below the skin barrier causing it to appear as acne.

Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,Salicylic acid has always had fallbacks for me and the biggest being dryness/flaking. This does the opposite!

Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,Made my face breakout . I havr combination skin and i never have acne. I get one little period bump once a month in the same place.

Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,"This product is horrible. It appears to have changed its formula and is very harsh on your skin. Do not use if you have even slighly sensitive skin.

Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,"I've used this product about two years ago and I never broke out. I started getting closed comedomes a year ago due to the summer heat so I used Benzyol Peroxide to help clear out my skin, it helped but but it lead to purging, redness and scars. I have closed comedomes again this year so instead of using Benzoyl Peroxide again, I'm going to use this product again to even my skin texture without purging. I've been using it for 3 days straight. I recommend to do a patch test for a week straight and to not use daily but a day yes and a day no to prevent damaging your skin barrier due to not being able to handle it. Only use once per day that you're going to use it if you're starting!!!!üíóüíó",5,,
Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,"i accidentally bought this product meaning to by the other salicylic acid serum and i used it for a while not knowing it was the cause of my new skin issues, after realizing that this was the problem, i stopped using it and my skin started clearing up within the nect couple of days",1,,

Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,this made my skin so much worse I was trying so hard to like it. I just want clear skin and it created a even bigger issue.,5,,

Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,"Ive used a couple products from the ordinary and I accidentally bought this one. I figured since I have really dry skin that this could work.

If you have acne problems, I do not reccomend.",5,,
Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,"To each their own but personally, the smell was horrendous! I used it once and that was enough for me to want to return this product. If you're sensitive to smells, I would not recommend this product.",1,,
Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,"I had really high hopes for this product and thus I am really disappointed. I am 16 and Ive never really struggled with acne in particular. Ive been getting lots of bumpy texture and closed comedones on my face, also experiencing some singular pimples here and there, these happened probably due to me adding into my routine a moisturizer that was too heavy for my skin. These pimples however werent really inflamed or hurt. I decided to try The Ordinary's serum because I saw someone say it saved their skin. So since my skin has been experiencing some problems I hoped this serum would solve them. Ive Heard about ""the purging phase"" and that this product will most probably cause it. I started using it about 3 weeks ago, and I did, in fact get lots of new pimples. They were inflamed, they hurt and they wouldnt go away. I also experienced some under-skin ones, i don't know what theyre called, but just they don't have anything ""poppable"" they just hurt and are swollen. And to this day i kept telling myself its the purging phase and i have to just suck it up and keep going. But my skin has gotten so bad ive become insecure about it like ive never been before. I don't think that what i experienced is what the purging phase should look like. Today i decided to stop using this product because it just breaks me out. So sadly i cant recommend this product :(( i added a star because it did a great job at keeping my dry skin moisturized",5,,
Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,I have been using this for 3 days. I apply it at night. It does help clear up bkemishes. I'm 49 and still get them occasionally. It dried it up quickly. I purchased to help clear congested pores. The solution is in an oil base that goes on smoothly. My only complaint is the smell. It almost smells like the oil is rancid. Maybe I got a bad bottle? It smells like pencil shavings from a pencil sharpener. Weird.,1,,
Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,I love this product for my skincare routine of my face!,3.8,,
Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,"I almost didn't buy after reading some of these reviews. I can't complain about my skin too much but always had a bumpy forehead w closed comedones, and particularly my temples. So I was terrified of the ""purge"". I think y'all just using too much too fast. I tried 2 drops, one for my forehead and one on jawline etc 2-3x a week and after 3 months I'm having noticeable improvement. Probably best for ""mild"" treatment on sensitive skin given how I've used it without irritation or an ugly purge phase",5,,
Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,"Yes, the smell is not very pleasant; Yes, the texture feel oily, even though it is not an oil-based serum, yes it doesn't sink in, but I love this product. I have had horrible breakouts for a few years on my chin and jawline and this product, in combination with the classic Salicylic Acid 2% solution, really helped me. I don't have big and painful pimples like I used to. And when I have a pimple, it disappear in 3 days, and it is waaaay smaller than what I had before. I use this product on the morning, and the classi serum in the evening. It even helped me when I had a little bit of eczema under one of my eye. This product; for example, works way better than the niacinamide 10% for me :)",1,,
Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Serum,I tried this for 3 weeks and it only made my acne so much worse. I was getting new huge pimples every single day even on my neck and I don't ever get pimples there. I thought maybe it's supposed to get worse before it gets better so I stuck with it for 3 weeks and it only got worse. I stopped using and my acne cleared up within a week of stopping.,4,,

Marine Hyaluronic Moisture Lock Serum,"I purchased this by mistake the first time-I was going for the regular hyaluronic which have a thicker consistency like most serums. This works great during those HOT HOT months!!! Yes, it's thin and watery which is a plus in the summer time. It absorbs QUICKLY! Those heavier serums don't compare when it's hot, humid and muggy outside.",3,,
Marine Hyaluronic Moisture Lock Serum,This is my second time purchasing this item as it has made a great impact in my regimen. I use this product as a mid day hydration boost or post chemical exfoliant. It's been a game changer! I am 10 years into my skincare journey and would consider myself an advanced user. I am 30 years old but would have introduced this to my routine long ago!,4,,
Marine Hyaluronic Moisture Lock Serum,"Lesson learned, I did a patch test of this on the sides of my face just in case I got an allergic reaction. Sure enough yup. BIG reaction! My face immediately started swelling up, tingling, and even getting NUMB!!! I took a Benadryl right away cause I was actually starting to panic. I had only seen one review of someone with a shellfish allergy getting a reaction, but I thought what are the chances I would? Pretty high apparently. The Ordinary, PLEASE put a disclaimer on this product for those with seafood/shellfish allergies! Wish I could've liked this product, sad to return it but just glad my reaction didn't get too severe.",3,,
Marine Hyaluronic Moisture Lock Serum,I notice a difference in my skin when I use this. Love it so much I bought 2 more bottles.,4.5,,
Marine Hyaluronic Moisture Lock Serum,Other products come and go but she stays. Great way to recover a surprising amount of moisture post cleanse while being so light that it doesn't interfere with products applied after.,5,,

Marine Hyaluronic Moisture Lock Serum,"This is my 1st ""The Ordinary"" review ever! And I had to have it be about this one! It works great and soothes, hydrates. I prefer it over the regular Hyaluronic. Personally, I've had THEE best luck with all their products, but it's because I know my skin/sensitives etc and I researched SEVERAL sources before using, went slow, patch tested etc. I have ONLY positive to say about these products!

Granactive Retinoid 5% in Squalane Serum,"I'm seeing results after the first few application. My skin is smoother, and my spot breakouts are clearing up (!). Note that it's in squalene, which makes it slightly oily. This is perfect for me because, although I have combo skin, and my skin appreciates the extra moisture. Even at the higher price end for The Ordinary, I only need 8 drops or so to cover my face and neck. I think the squalene provides greater stability. Still, I keep it in a makeup fridge and use it up before the 3 month expiration. (Retinoids loss efficacy after a short time; it's not a ploy to sell more product. Someday I might try a prescription strength retinoid. For now, this is a great otc retinoid. Gentle enough to use after other gentle exfoliators (on my face).",5,,
Granactive Retinoid 5% in Squalane Serum,"I started using this product 6 months ago as I had really bad hyperpigmentation/melasma everywhere (especially as a stache which is great for one's confidence).

Granactive Retinoid 5% in Squalane Serum,I really like how lightweight this formula is. My skin feels soft and hydrated when I wake up in the morning. I like to also put it on my hands for hydration and collagen production. Please keep this product forever. I am definitely a lifelong customer!,5,,

Granactive Retinoid 5% in Squalane Serum,I purchased 2 bottles for my mom last year. She finished the first bottle today. She was trying to get every single drop out of the bottle so she tried to dip a cotton swab in the bottle. It came out with some gross black residue! She opened the brand new second bottle and the oil is not a clear color like shown on the website. It has some brown/gray stuff (see last photo - bottom of the lid) GROSS!!!,4.2,,

Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,After trying countless products to heal my damaged skin barrier I decided to try out this serum since I really liked the hyaluronic acid from this brand. In the last few months since I started using this the redness and acne scars on my face have almost completely faded!

Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,"Disclaimer - My skin is on the oily side, prone to the occasional hormonal breakout. Only knocked off one star because of the oily sheen this can give my skin, HOWEVER, a little goes a long way. Using less helps prevent more oil from forming. So perhaps it was user error on my end. Otherwise this is great. Had a couple noticeable acne scars on my face that were red in color. This helped make them go away and are sooooo much less noticeable now. When doing research in remedies for acne scarring, this product came up, and im so glad it did. Have bought it several times. I dont use daily, but i do use this roughly 4-5 times per week.",4.5,,
Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,"I use/have used a few different The Ordinary products throughout the last few years, this one being more recently. I think I have been using this for about 6 months now, maybe 8. I honestly can't really tell that it really helps with uneven skin, appearance of pores, etc. It's actually pretty good as a very light moisturizer and feels good as you're putting it on. It is a little sticky before it dries, but I layer products so I don't care about the finish of it. I guess I'll stop using it for a while to see if my skin reacts lol",5,,
Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,it's made a huge difference on my skin,1,,
Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,I have tried other things that claim to help with post acne marks and none of them worked that well. I was so surprised by how well this works. It speeds up healing tremendously! It also helps a lot with redness. Very impressed.,4,,
Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,The texture is like a serum. It takes a while for it to be absorbed into the skin. There is really no scent that I can tell from this product. The packaging from The Ordinary is always great and you always get a good price for product.,3,,
Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,"So I actually used this because an ulta employee recommended it to me for my acne skin and scars. While I saw not much improvement from scars, I did see improvement in my acne and texture. Made me look a lot flawless than usual due to it fixing my textures. Will buy again!",4.5,,
Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,Love the productsthe staff is amazing loop,5,,
Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,"I got this a bit ago and I used it for 8 weeks just to see what it would do, I struggled with scarring, redness, texture, and a broken skin barrier. This serum didn't really help with the the darker scarring, but it definitely did help with the lighter and smaller spots here and there. Completely fixed my skin barrier, and therefore also fixed my redness (one issue came from the other) I'M TELLING YOU I GOT SO MANY COMPLIMENTS. My skin texture also definitely improved a lot, my skin feels a whole lot smoother. Not only did this serum work wonders but it's also super moisturizing and leaves the skin with a satin finish. Love it.",1,,
Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,"Very healing, it's my first time getting into skin care products at 22 since i've been breaking out very badly after getting sick and I have to say i'm impressed. I've never been interested in the skin care world since it's so overwhelming with all the options out there but i'm glad i did some looking around ! It's been about a month since my purchase & i can see a lot of improvement. No cons for me so far.",4,,
Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,I have sensitive skin so unfortunately this serum didn't work out for me It was leaving my face red and burning I really wish it had worked out because other skin care products from this line worked great on my skin,5,,
Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,"I didn't find that this was super effective or helpful. I typically don't breakout often, but when I do, I was hoping this would help with the redness and aftermath, but it didn't. The packaging is nice and easy to use and I didn't notice much of a scent. It also feels nice on the skin especially since I have dry skin. Overall, I would not repurchase",4.5,,
Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,Super light solution that doesn't feel too Oily or overbearing. Small amount of applied solution dries quickly and leaves a glow. No overbearing scent or texture. A lot of solution for the small bottle. Would purchase again,5,,
Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,"I bought this a week or two ago and so far it is just okay. I was using the niacinamide and zinc serum and my skin was looking better. After adding this to my routine I've noticed more breakouts on my forehead, an area which I don't usually breakout or get many pimples on.",1,,
Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,"I have sensitive skin but also very clear skin, mainly hormonal acne or just from workong and working out (sweat) but this stuff has helped immensely w using a moistuizer eye cream and this only, reduced my redness and spots",2,,

Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution Serum,An effective product that quickly works. Used this while on a trip to Mexico and noticed I had no redness on my face the entire time.

That being said, I also have a dry scalp and was desperately hoping this would work somehow, so I tried using it as an overnight treatment.

Unfortunately I cant say this has made any difference to my scalp.",4,,
Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid Scalp Serum,Living in the desert dries out my hair and skin. This scalp serum hydrates my scalp without making it greasy like other hair oils.

Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid Scalp Serum,"I used dandruff shampoos for years and they never made my flakes any better.

The only downside is it's kind of annoying to apply because it soaks right in. Definitely requires more than ""a few drops"" per application.",2,,
Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid Scalp Serum,"I suffered with severe scalp pain during bleaching, followed by excessive flaking for few days after my salon visit. This serum has completely changed this. I use this to prep my scalp few hours before my salon appointment and again at bedtime. During bleaching, it seems to create a barrier between my scalp and the chemical which really has helped with the pain during the process. When used after my salon visit, it soothes my irritated scalp (feels equivalent to applying aloe after sunburn), which has prevented the excessive flaking post bleaching. It totally changed my life. I would highly recommend",5,,

Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid Scalp Serum,"I bought this in place of the usual HA scalp serum I get as it was out of stock. Soo disappointed. While the serum helps my scalp psoriasis a bit, it leaves the hair absolutely soaked and does not dry, leaving your hair to look incredibly greasy even though it is freshly washed and dried.

Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid Scalp Serum,"I have mild psoriasis on my scalp and always used topical steroid cream to reduce the flakes and scales forming on my scalp. When I started to use this scalp right after my shower, I noticed that the flakes and scales have virtually been non-existent. Partly because I can use this product liberally all over the scalp, and also it is a very light weight solution that it spreads easily and absorbs into my dry scalp quickly, which gives the much-needed moisture that my scalp has been suffering for years. I use this even during daytime, and it does not make my hair greasy at all.",4,,
Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid Scalp Serum,"Just be sure to stay on the scalp, it makes the hair a bit oily if not.",5,,
Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid Scalp Serum,"This makes my hair SO greasy, it's disgusting. If I'm going to use it, I have to make sure it's the weekend or night before hair wash day only. Since I can't use it often, I can't say if it helps much",1,,
Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid Scalp Serum,I really wanted to love this since my scalp gets dry and itchy. Unfortunately it made my hair greasy and not enough moisture.

Pycnogenol 5% High-Potency Antioxidant Serum,"I wanted SO badly to love this, since the reviews have been so positive. I struggle with adult-onset acne, and I have a pretty good routine that keeps breakouts at bay. However, my skin can look pretty dull as a result. Most antioxidants I've tried, including Vitamin C, have only clogged my pores or not fit in well with my other products. But I really wanted something to help brighten my skin up after exfoliants. Sadly, this goes in with all the other brightening products I've tried. It's too sticky, makes my sunscreen pill, and just made me break out all over again. I quit using after a week. Yes, I know some products cause cell turnover and that can cause breakouts temporarily, but in my experience, those breakouts never stopped even after weeks of using. Just not willing to risk it again. Very happy it works for others, but if you have combination-oily skin like me, be cautious with tacky, oil-like products.",5,,
Pycnogenol 5% High-Potency Antioxidant Serum,I have struggled with this condition since post partum. Usually just a flare when weeding or planting in the spring.

Seven months ago, I started using The Ordinary (daily Niacinamide on my face and this B5 + amino acids (hair snd eye brows) and the B5 + amino acids and also copper peptides (eye brows) and now my facial skin is much healthier and my hair and eye brows are thicker and healthier too.",3,,
Amino Acids + B5 Hydrating Serum,"So, far this product hasn't disappointed me. Using at night.",5,,
Amino Acids + B5 Hydrating Serum,"I use this daily, typically with Niacinamide 10% and Natural Moisturizing Factors, and at night with a retinol added to the mix. I add some other products on occasion (Vit. C, Multi-Peptide + Copper Peptide), but always use this. Nothing has made my skin look so good. I have been out for a few weeks and I notice a dramatic difference in how my skin looks and feels. This combo leaves me with glassy, smooth, hydrated, and hormonal acne-free skin. I will never let myself run out again!",5,,
Amino Acids + B5 Hydrating Serum,I've been using it for three months and it works for my dry skin.Luv the effects,4.4,,

Amino Acids + B5 Hydrating Serum,"I have very dry, dehydrated skin and a rough flakey patch on my face that shows up every winter. This product really keeps it at bay. I use it after cleansing, before moisturizing. I also only need about half as much moisturizer when I use this.",3,,
Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% Serum,This product is oily and sticky and even after an hour did not absorb into my skin. I tried to sleep on my back. The next day my skin was red and flaky- it took me a week to get back to normal. Skip this.,4.1,,
Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% Serum,I have been using this for about 2 weeks now. I was surprised that it warms up when you apply it. It doesn't burn but just warm. My skin is starting to look less dull.,4,,
Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% Serum,"I am allergic to ingredients in almost ALL skincare, but NOT this one! Goes on warm and smells like a campfire, but absorbs quickly and scent disappears. Makes my very sensitive oily/combination skin SOFT & SUPPLE. My makeup and concealer glides on effortlessly, and my skin feels moisturized and smooth, without the shine. Thrilled with this product! I can't use moisturizer because it makes my face shiny and greasy, so this is an amazing alternative. P.S. Put this on BEFORE your Hyaluronic Acid, not after (or else the HA will pill-up on your skin.)",3,,
Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% Serum,I use this daily in the am and before bed. Love the noticeable changes. Those complaining about being in the sun and etc. Research it. It states sensitivity to the sun. Has also been said not to use in the sun. Research before you complain. It works great if you use it the right way. Keeps my skin smooth and helped with my dark spots.,1,,
Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% Serum,"One or two drops after mild probiotic toner caused burning. Next day I had two red, flaking patches in each side of my face. Stopped using.

My vitamin C product contains ferrulic acid and I can use it without irritation so kind of a mystery. Somehow I ended up with 2 bottles of this product and I can't use it.

Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% Serum,I have no clue if this works because the stench of it revolts me. How are there so many positive reviews without any mention of the fact that your face ends up smelling like a hot dog?,4.1,,
Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% Serum,"I've been using this for 6 months now, at first I didn't know if there was a difference but I didn't use it for a couple weeks and started having more acne (I'm 6 months in with tretinoin, never really had acne before tret) and realized I hadn't been using this enough. Within a couple days of adding back in my skin tone has evened out and my acne is significantly calmer, too. It also seemed to help my skin after a mild sunburn, not positive though. I highly recommend though. I also use this to make my vit c serum using about a half scoop of the vitamin c powder, about 5-6 drops of marine hyluronics, and 2 drops of the resveratrol/ferulic acid and it works well.",4,,
Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% Serum,"I used this product morning and night (1-2 drops) consistently for ~2 years with amazing results. Noticeably brightened my skin with the added bonus of a low price point and one bottle lasting for ages. However, after having a baby, my skin became more sensitive, and this product couldn't do its job under those conditions. It took me a good 6 months to realize that I should change my skincare routine, and at that point, I saw that my skin was less irritated when I didn't use this product (the primary culprit, however, was over-exfoliation). I tried to re-introduce this product around a year after changing my skincare routine, but it didn't seem to have much effect. However, when I recently re-introduced it again (I now have melasma and it's driving me nuts!), I noticed that my skin was responding positively right away. So bottom line: this product is absolutely AMAZING, BUT your skin barrier must be healthy enough to benefit. If this product doesn't work for you, or you suddenly can't tolerate it after a long period of use, consider a gentler skincare regimen and then try re-introducing it later; it's definitely worth trying because my skin hasn't been as bright without this product. I am SO happy that I can use it again!",3,,
Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% Serum,"I am not sure if it's because the product expired or because of repeated exposure to the chemical but one morning I woke up with one of my eyes completely swollen shut and the skin red (the eye itself was totally fine). I didn't realize at first that it was the product but it happened a second time when it affected both eyes / eye regions; the skin on both my eye lids and on my cheek bones felt chemically burnt, were red and swollen. The swelling went away by the end of the day but the scab from the burn and swollen skin took days to heal and come off. I think this might have happened because of the product expiring - I ordered it a year ago and didn't realize since it lasted quite long and was stored in the fridge. I am tempted but too scared to try with a new bottle - overall I can't say I saw any significant improvment to my skin when I did use it anyway.",1,,

I tried so many things including azelaic acid and dr dennis gross peel pads which are 10x more expensive( they helped but not as good as this) and felt hopeless because it seemed like nothing was working fast enough for what i wanted and I literally looked like a pizza üçï. I decided to try this again, as i had used it before and liked it. In just 9 days( 2/3 uses for me, I used twice a week) the marks had DRASTICALLY improved. It gave me hope so I stayed consistent with it and now ive been using it for about 7 weeks and my face is 90% clear again! So glad i tried this. ü•∞",3,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,Great overall product! Works within days! I use 2 x a week and this is the real deal. A little goes a long way! Wont break the bank and is highly effective!,5,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,"I used this mask a few times for several months, and recently, it started to burn my face, like my eyes, lips, cheeks, etc. leaving it on for 10 mins felt like an eternity. I will never use this mask again because it worked amazingly before.",5,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,"I have been using this mask for a few years now, and has been my go to for clearing up my skin. Absolutely love it! However, the last time I used it, I got a chemical burn! This has never happened before, and I believe my bottle may have expired!",4.4,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,Ive been using this for a long time and my pores always look so much better after applying. Great product!,5,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,As an esthetician this is something i use on myself. It gives a smooth glowing look after efrct and I can feel the difference.,3,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,"I used this exfoliating mask for 5 years but gave up on it a year ago because I felt like the formula had changed. I used to LOVE this product. I do not have sensitive skin but I noticed the last time I used it, it was burning my skin which was abnormal. I picked this product up recently to give it another try as stated above, this stuff saved my skin years ago but now I am dealing with a slight chemical burn on both my cheeks.",4,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,I use to use this product and it stings way too much I genuinely don't understand the concept of leaving this on for 5 mins or how ppl do it bc it hurts too bad feels like you got cuts all over your face then squeezed lemon juice on them agh . I just gave it to my sis she can trash it for all I care forüòÇ something that u put on ur face shouldn't hurt this bad,5,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,"I love this product. It is very good and the price is affordable. However, people with sensitive skin should test this product by doing a skin test because if you leave it on too long it can cause irritation.",4.4,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,"The first time I used this peeling solution I noticed my skin texture was a lot smoother and my blackheads were noticeably smaller. It is a very strong product, it stings a good bit while it's on and I had to use a good thick moisturizer after.",5,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,"This leaves my skin looking and feeling SO soft. Totally forgot about it, but have been having some issues with dullness to my skin. Woke up with it looking visibly soft and brighter! Does burn a little for about 15 seconds, but nothing painful. I can imagine if you have sensitive skin, or are prone to redness youd want to avoid.",3,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,I wanted to believe it would work. I tried this product for a fee months. It did nothing for me. Execpt make my face tingle.,4,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,It serves its purpose . Did not burn at all.,5,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,"this was painful for me to use. it felt like a burning sensation the second i put it on my skin. i took it off immediately but it took over 24 hours for the redness to go away. maybe good for others, but my skin isnt that sensitive and this hurt.",4.4,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,"There's a slight tingly sensation upon applying and rinse no more than 10mins.

AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,"But it burns, caused acne around the lower chin area, even using once a week, no improvement with pore size or blackheads.",3,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,Truly in love with this little bottle of magic. It removed the lines in my face and skin comes out so bright and fresh. Best part is pores look so small after a rinse. Do not use more than 2x a week.,1,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,I've used twice and think I see a brightening in skin. I like the Ordinary brand so I will use through the bottle and see if the difference continues.,5,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,"Wanted to try this for a while. Over the yrs I never really had acne, but I had scaring from pimples along my jaw line. I use this once every two weeks and the scarring is almost completely gone. Only down side is the smell.",4.4,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,Love this product and highly recommend it,5,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,"I decided to try this after seeing it everywhere and knowing the Ordinary has a great price point. Maybe my hopes were a little higher because I really liked the Cold Pressed Rosehip Oil from this brand, but this product doesn't meet the expectation. It's not bad, no irritation and residue redness from the color the next morning, but also..no results. My skin doesn't feel or look any different. I wouldn't purchase this again, instead I'd put my money towards a product that may cost more, but gives me my money's worth.",3,,
AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution,"I have used this product weekly for about a year and a half. I had severe cystic acne in my younger years, which left alot of scarring. I struggled with large pores, and my skin looked congested, i gave this product a try. I was hesitant, as always with any product due to my face being prone to breakouts. This didn't break me out. It made my skin look tigher, brighter, cleaner and less congested. It has also lightened previous acne scars. I leave it on for 10 minutes, and rinse it off really well. Follow the directions and do not use it more often than what is recommeneded, that will cause issues. I will always keep this in my bathroom closet!",4,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I have only been using this night cream for about a week, but I do like the feel of it. CeraVe is a reputable company and their products are effective. I like that his cream has peptides which help build collagen in the skin. The cream also has hyaluronic acid for moisturizing and ceramides which protect the skin's natural barrier. My skin does feel moisturized when I apply this product.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,switched from clarins and never going back.,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Heavy night cream if you are looking for a heavy moisturizer. I still feel it on my face in yhe morning. I alternate with another heavy cream- but this is a favorite.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I usually love this brand of products. this is my first time trying the night cream + first off it is a very small amount for the price but my biggest complaint is the smell. it stinks. Not the smell I want to have before going to bed and sitting on my face all night,4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,This moisturizer works well on my sensitive skin. It's a thick texture and a little goes a long way.

I was surprised to feel that the Cerave cream did not feel oily like the IT cream does and it went on so smoothly.

The following day I noticed reduced inflammation on my acne and I feel like my skin looked hydrated when I woke up. My skin is oily, and I have heavy, acne all over my face and part due to hormones and in part do a terrible diet and finding products at work is a challenge as my skin never completely clears up. I am terrible at keeping up a skin care routine so I cannot speak about daily use and the effects of consistently using this product but when I have been able to keep up with applying this cream for more than two nights in a row, my skin looks healthier and more than anything that I wanted this product to do to rival the IT night cream is to reduce the inflammation of my acne.",1,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I have super sensitive skin and rosacea so I have to be careful of what I use on my face. Tried this nighttime cr√®am on sale & thought I'd give it a try. It keeps your face moisturized and doesn't irritate my skin, but it feels like a plastic coating on your face. I'm going back to my IT cosmetics confidence in a cream moisturizer even though the new formula slightly stings my face. I can't stand this plastic feel on my face with this CeraVe night cream.",5,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"Very happy with this product. Use with CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Facial Serum for Acne Prone Skin. Very oily 70 year old skin, no acne or breakouts. This combination for me has smoothed my skin and reduce pore size. I don't have a lot of wrinkles, only upside of oily skin. lol",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I had been loyal to a prestige brand for many years before trying this and I'm kicking myself for all the money I wasted. The cream is thick but feels whipped somehow- amazing texture. It absorbs fast but leaves me still feeling moisturized in the morning. And it's unscented. And a little goes a long way. It's darn near perfect.,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I really like this product. It feels rich and luxurious but with a reasonable price tag. I like that it is unscented. I apply it at night and I still feel moisturized the next morning. I will definitely repurchase.,4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I don't know what's going on over at CeraVe, but they've reformulated so many of their go-to skincare products and now they're awful! I was an avid user of all things CeraVe for over five years. Had excellent skin due to their products and my routine. But this latest batch I've bought, both this night cream and their day lotion with spf, has been such a letdown. This night cream was weird. Some nights it was too greasy, other nights it wasn't hydrating enough and I had to use a facial oil with it. And the packaging is too small for what you pay. Night cream usually lasts me almost 2 seasons, this one barely got me through summer. I did not notice an improvement in my skin. I have combo/oily skin and I'm 40. Not worth it, don't recommend.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I've been using it for a week and can already tell a difference in my skin. Definitely recommend!,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I do not have acne prone skin, but this clogged my pore and gave me pimples in places I've never gotten them. Felt extremely heavy on my face.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"Gave me so many closed comedones, absolutely wrecked my skin.",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"This is a thick but non-greasy moisturizer. It blends in very well and feels good on the skin. It does not irritate my sensitive skin. The only downside is the smell, which is a very light smell, but it is chemical-y and not pleasant. It quickly fades. I use a vitamin C product with a nice smell at the same time so I don't notice the smell.",4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I have repurchased 3x so far. I wish it was a bit cheaper but it is a great price compared to other night creams, esp for a sensitive friendly formula. it can feel a bit heavy/greasy but I could just be applying too much too. I like to use this at night as my final skincare product a few times a week.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,My skin broke out really bad when I used this product. It's taken almost a month to clear my skin again. The cream felt too thick and didn't absorb well on my skin.,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"My husband I both love this overnight cream. When I started searching for something new to us, effective and also not break the bank since I'm sharing it (haha), i discovered that it's on all recommended lists, regardless of it's every day pricing. We both love it. It's smooth and a little thick so a little bit goes a long way. If you want to wake up feeling smooth and moisturized, this product is fab. We also use the overnight eye cream, which has the same, richer texture.",4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I ran out of my dermalogica night cream and bought this randomly on promotion because my skin can be sensitive and I like the brand. A little goes a long way. Nice formula For the price.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I have tried so many different facial moisturizers over the years. I have a red rough patch on my cheek and this has completely changed the look and feel of my skin. I've been using for only a week and already can see and feel a difference.,4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,i love this i have bought at least 15 of these in the last two years i just wish they would sell a larger size,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"Definitely helped my face feel very moisturized and soft in the morning, but caused me to break-out. I have acne-prone skin so it wasn't a huge shock, but won't be repurchasing",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I love this product. My favorite night cream by far. I wake up and my skin is glowing and beautiful. I have oily combo skin and it totally helps manage those issues.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"This is thick but it goes on smoothly without being greasy, however, for my combo Oily Skin type, this cream was too thick and clogged my pores. I went through two tubs of this product before I realized what was causing my almost daily breakouts.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"such a great product, saved my skin barrier! wish there was more in the container though, it's most effective when you apply generously. i wake up and my skin feels amazing, hasn't caused any breakouts!",4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Seems okay if youre not acne prone. Unfortunatley broke me out,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Ive been using for nearly a year and I love it. Its the perfect amount of moisture and leaves my skin so soft.,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I have really ouly skin and ir made my t zone break out so much. I've gotten so many pimples around my nose and forehead ever since I switched moisturizers. I do like how thick the cream is and how it makes me feel soft wnd moisturized.,4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Absolutely my favorite night cream. I have combo sensitive skin w rosacea and this product works perfectly with my skin. Its a heavy cream that quickly absorbs into the skin leaving you feeling deeply hydrated without being tacky!,2,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"My skin has been clearing up for the past couple weeks and I've been wanting to try a new night moisturizer. Ive noticed new breakouts since using this product, specifically around my t-zone.",4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"Its thick and all but it makes me break out terribly , i have combination skin and i am nit sure what happened but i will be returning this .",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I have incredibly oily skin, but I bought this after I went overboard on acne treatment and ruined my skin barrier. This did mot cause me pimples or irritation, and did not increase oiliness. Makes my skin look soft and plump.",1,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I have (had?) combination/acne prone skin. Between taking collagen and using this creme, the few fine lines I had are all gone and now I get mistaken for being younger for the first time in my life. I had bumps along my jaw and between this and benzoyl peroxide, my skin is flawless It's the one I'll always come back to. I look at it like I look at aloe vera. Every house should have a bottle on stock. Soooo healing and hydrating.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Like how my skin feels after applying to my face. I'm 77 so don't hold out hope to rid my face of wrinkles.,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Im making my 2nd purchase.,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Washed my face with just soap and water to try this product out . Saw tons of reviews and wanted to give it a shot . I have combination skin and rosacea . My rosacea is not really bad or anything but this make it flare up . I saw this was good for sensitive skin and it was not . Im going to return this . Was very disappointed,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I was looking for something to keep my skin protected and hydrated during the cold winter months. This seems to do the trick.I like that it's thicker than other moisturizers, and feels light yet heavy-duty. It's also lasting me a while.",4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,This night cream is really good. I have combo skin and it doesnt break me out. Doesnt feel oily nor heavy and you wake up with soft moisturized skin.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Love the brand and have used it for years. I use the product at night and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"Not sure I would recommend this product to anyone, def mid.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I've used many different products of varying prices but I'm surprised at the difference this little jar makes. I wake up with my face feeling soft and nourished. Not greasy, just moisturizing.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Have been using the Cerave Renewing skin care products for about a year and really like them and my skin looks and feels great. They are just as good as the high dollar ones for a fraction of the price. I will continue using their skin care line.,4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,This cream initially softened my skin a ton. BUT if you are clog prone like me...this caused a huge issue where the product ended up being too occlusive for me and caused a giant flare up. I'm now dealing with a ton of acne because of this. Fail :(,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I always use CereVe PM cream day and night (my makeup already had 50spf, so didn't need the AM one) it worked great until this year when I felt I needed something more moisturizing at night because my skin still felt dry in the morning. This renewing night cream does the trick. I only needed to use a small amount and I don't wake up with my skin feeling tight. Love it and the price point is affordable.",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Very rich and soothing,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"First of all, my skin is very sensitive and picky. Second of all, I LOVE thick balms, especially at night. This is very thick, a little does go a long way, but I lather it on. My face feels so smooth and refreshed in the morning. It definitely provides quality moisture. I started getting eczema flare ups on my face as I age (almost 31.) This and the Cerave ointment healed my face Eczema in only 3 nights! I also have SUPER DRY skin on my hands, especially in winter. I use this on my knuckles, hands, fingers, etc and it instantly makes everything baby soft. I am obsessed. Already purchased 3 jars within about a month or month and a half. Just wish there was a bigger container or something. That's my only complaint BUT I will keep buying this because it works!",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I love this cream! I have very dry skin, even to the point of getting dry flaky spots on my face. Since using this cream, I have not had those spots! I like to use this day and night, and just combine it with a face sunscreen in the morning. I also love this cream for my lips. I always have super dry, chapped lips, but using this at night on my lips followed by vaseline really helps my lips not be so chapped. It doesnt have a weird taste that you can sometimes have after licking your lips. I would buy this product again and again.",4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I have combination/ super dry/acne prone skin and when I first used this product I really like it as it was super moisturizing and left my skin feeling so soft. It wasnt until a couple days of use I started to get several spots of deep cystic acne which is super unusual for me. I looked up the ingredients and there are three that were flagged as high risk for acne prone skin. I will stick to the cerave tub moisturizer because that always works well for me and has never given me a breakout.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Very good product and great price,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"Wanted to love this since the reviews are so positive and I love their face wash, but this did absolutely nothing to positively help my dry, sensitive skin. It was moisturizing briefly but then completely broke me out the next morning. No matter when I used it or with what other products, this always just broke me out come morning. Could not use more than 3-4 times.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I'm getting everything I need in this plain little jar for a great price. I don't need to spend $80+ bucks on pretty packaging for 1.2 ounces when I can have this last me for months and actually give me visible results in just a week or so. It definitely feels amazing after a hot shower at night before bed. You don't need much for an entire face and neck. I also use their cream to foam face cleanser beforehand and my skin feels so soft.,2,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I love CeraVe products. I use their face wash every morning and night and end my night time skin care routine with this moisturizer every night. It pairs so well with whatever serums or retinol I choose. Highly recommend!,4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I really love putting this on every night it makes me face super soft and smooth.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Against my better judgement I wanted to try this product in search of a heavy night cream. CeraVe ingredients are garbage. Never again. It's full of silicone and feels like a layer of plastic over my skin. Not a good moisterizer.,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I adore this product! Works soooo great on my dry, dull skin. It has a balm texture more than a cream one, but it doesnt feel obnoxiously greasy or gross on my skin at all. A little bit goes a very long way and i stay moisturized all day and all night. My sunscreen also wears well on top of this. I dont get why Ulta charges SO MUCH for this though. Go to another store to get this!",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I've been using this product nightly for over a year, and I absolutely love it. I have very dry skin, but this product is hydrating and lasts through the night. I used to use a Murad night cream, but it was much more expensive and irritated my skin.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Great for skin repair and locks on moisture,4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I love how it feels and makes my skin feel. It doesn't leave an oily or greasy feeling. It provides the right amount of moisturizing for at night and makes my skin look so smooth.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"When I use active ingredients for my acne, I always end with this night cream. The thickness fully protects my stripped skin, and in the morning it is fully absorbed and my skin feels supple. Despite it's thickness, I never break out with this product. My pores are always clear the next day.",1,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I have extremely dry skin and have been using this for years. I used to wake up with plump, hydrated skin and the cream fully absorbed into my skin. The last tub I bought pilled like crazy in the morning and just sat on top of my skin instead of absorbing. No change to my routine. I thought I maybe just bought a bad batch and bought one more just in case, both from ulta. Same thing. They had to have changed something. So sad. On the hunt for another moisturizer :(",4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,My dermatologist recommended this when I told him my prior experience with tretinion and the peeling and sensitivity that came along with it. I have been using this in conjunction with prescription adapelene and it has been wonderful. It has prevented my skin from becoming very irritated from the prescription cream! I have pretty dry sensitive skin so it says a lot :),5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Dried out my already aging skin. I would wake up during the night with itchy face and scratching.,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Love CeraVe products so I was excited to try. I really like this moisturizer. I got it as a sample and ended up buying the full size version because I really like how well it moisturized my skin. It is definitely THICK but it's great for a wintertime moisturizer to help my skin from drying out and flaking as a result of retinol use.,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Product was dried up and half gone! Kind of waxy! Will not repurchase!,5,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"Ive been using this for about two months now and i've definitely noticed a difference in my skin!! I was having problems with dry patches and dull skin and this cream saved me! Although it is small for the price, would appreciate more product for how pricey it is",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Too thick for me. Made my face breakout. I got little bumps on my face and on my neck. I was surprised because this line is known for sensitive skin.,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"Love love love, it competes with more highend products. Basically part of my holy grail now. For the price it really is worth it",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I used this mousturizer consitently until it was gone. No noticeable changes in my skin and my skin didn't feel any different. I would just rate this as an average night cream. Not bad but not great.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I tried this based on recommendations from TikTok and it is great! It's thick but my morning skin is totally hydrated and smooth.,4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Love it!,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,My skin is THE best judge for harsh chemicals. And it loved this product! Its CLEAN!! no fragrances and no harsh chemicals! Perfect for sensitive and dry skin.,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"After giving up on expensive night moisturizers due to the cost, my skin developed mature age-related eczema. It took me a while to fogure out that's what it was as I had never had eczema before. I tried a few daily moisturizers, but it would not budge. After 2 days of using geneous applications of this product a few times a day, my eczema is gone! I love the viscosity - it's thick, glides on easily, and is emmolient. When I wake in the morning my skin still feels soft and hydrated. The results, reasonable price, and lack of scent make it a winner for me!",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,At first glance this moisturizer looks like putty but it glides on so smooth and does not leave your face feeling oily at all.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I have had terrible cystic acne since I was a teenager and am on some pretty drying topical gels but this is a life saver! My BFF recommended this to me and I am sk glad she did. It hydrates so well and immediately makes my face feel so smooth and soft. Also- I will put little dots of it on my pimples and they literally have almost disappeared by the morning. It's truly a miracle in a jar!,4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I love this stuff it is the best!,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"received this container, not even close to as full as the product used to be. for the price, u should at least get the full 1.7 oz. I took photos of what I received..not using this night cream again going forward. cerave already increased prices, but this is on another level.",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I've been using this for a couple of weeks after having to replace my previous HG moisturizer due to a formula change. I use this at night only, and it's very balmy feeling but with no greasy residue. I use it under my eyes as well. Great improvement in how my skin looks in the mornings and I can visibly see a difference in my forehead wrinkles.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I have combination skin that's oily on my forehead but is super dry and flaky around my lips and on my chin. I like to use this for my chin and around my eyes, which are two driest places. I have tried so many moisturizers before and they would all leave my skin dry still after using. This never fails to hydrate my dry areas. I used to have problems with my chin flaking and peeling, but not anymore thanks to this. So if you have that problem I 100% recommend this. It's the only product I've kept in my skin care routine to use at night. If you don't have really dry problem areas on your skin then this might be a bit too heavy for you and I would go for a lighter moisturizer. Also I have acne prone skin and this doesn't bother that too much for me",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Just wasn't what I was looking for. I want a thick heavy moisturizer that makes me feel super hydrated and I don't get that from this. It hasnt done anything amazing for me but I don't hate it.,4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I am acne prone and sensitive to a lot of products/brands and I needed something thick and moisturizing for my night routine but didn't want anything too greasy. This worked great and did not cause me to break out AT ALL! only downfall is the small container and little product that comes inside for the price. Other than that I love it.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Great for anti aging and moisture. Can feel that it seals the skin with moisture. Perfect for mid to late 20's or older when skin starts producing less oil on its own. I'm super sensitive to products and fragrance causing breakouts but this does NOT break me out :),1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I just started a skincare regime for my sensitive, extra dry skin. I have incorporated this product and have noticed a huge difference in my skin immediately. Will absolutely repurchase.",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Winter is hardest on my lips as I have combo skin year round. This cream on my lips is the best to keep them soft and moisturized after I exfoliate them.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"Looked like a great product at first and maybe it would be for dry skin, but not for my combination skin type. It makes my face super greasy even with the smallest amount applied. Not to mention it's winter and I normally need a bit more hydration during this time.",4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I have sensitive aging, semi oily skin. This product has moisturized my skin but is not greasy, it spreads easily, there is no fragrance and is a good price.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"Worst face cream I have ever used. It's unscented and smells so bad!! Pulling and tugging on my face while trying to spread this very thick, DRY cream. Tossed it after using it one time. I use Cerave face wash and moisturizing cream and love them both.",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I think the results of this product are subtle, which is to be expected from a simple night cream! I love it. I only wish that it was a little less thick/easier to apply.",2,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"29 with dry skin. I utilize this cream, followed by roseseed oil every other night. Its thick enough to hydrate my skin, and after using it for several weeks now has not caused any breakouts. Love CeraVe products for my naturally sensitive, dry skin",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I love this night cream. Ive been using it for about a year and it leaves my skin hydrated & glowy but not greasy. The only ""con"" is that it doesn't come in a bigger container so Im repurchasing more than Id like to.",4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I was very hesitant about the price when I bought this. However, I will say it is 100% worth the money. My skins not only feels better and hydrated it also looks better! Highly highly recommend this product.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Its perfect ! Helps me a lot with my dry skin ! Love it !,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,My dermatologist recommended this for my skin. I bought it and it is wonderful.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,So I tried this product at night time and work up with my pores feeling so clogged and noticed little bumps on my face . I noticed when I first applied to my face it instantly got red. I'm gonna return it.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I have a very acne prone, combination skin type. Though I loved this cream in the sense it's super moisturizing - it left me with huge closed comedones all over my forehead. After I stopped using they have slowly started to shrink and go away. I think this product is good if you have a less acne prone skin type. I love other Cera Ve products - this one was just too thick and pore clogging for my skin.",4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"Word of advice‚Ä¶if u find something that work, stick to it! Being a product junkie I decide to give this a try and now I'm breaking out. But doesn't mean it's a bad product. And I wanted this product to work being in the market for a night cream.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"As a Cerave Long-time lover, this cream just gives my skin extra moisture and wonderful for the night! No irritation, just good skin!",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I tried this for a few weeks and had to stop. I found that the product left me with lumpy textured skin with milia all over my forehead and cheeks. If you have thin and very dry milia prone skin, this isn't the product for this skin type. Have not found a single product from this brand other than the SA cleanser that I can use.",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,No so hydrating for my normal to dry skin. I have 1 month using it.,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,This is the only heavier night moisturizer that doesn't make me feel greasy or slimy. It always leaves my skin with a shine and helps retain my youthful skin!!!!,4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,When I tell you this is like a youth magic wand‚Ä¶ OMG! I could tell a difference day 1. It moisturizes and it gives me refreshed looking skin! I just turned 55 and I have definitely found my foundation of youth!!! Will definitely be purchasing again and again and again,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,This has been my go-to for a few years now. Works great on my combination skin I just wish CeraVe stuck with their old packaging and old prices. I hate having to pay primo prices for products just because they are in fancy glass jars.,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I bought this because my skin was getting a little too dry for my usual cerave pm to do the job. I really like the formulation, it's thick and emollient but with a matte texture so you never look too greasy. It was great on my dry skin but I noticed I started getting milia and closed comedones on certain parts of my face when I used it. If you don't struggle with breakouts you might be ok but I had to stop using it.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,This is a great value for money. Nice and thick without be greasy. Really locks in moisture and plumps up the skin.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I'm in love with the night cream. I was looking for something to help with dryness I would wake up with in the morning. This product delivered that and more! Not only did it help with dry skin but it gives my skin the nicest glow when I wake up. It's super thick which can be a little intimidating but rubs in non greasy and actually leaves an almost matte like finish. It also leaves your skin feeling super soft after applying it at night- I seriously sat in bed for like an hour just feeling how soft my skin was after applying it for the first time. It's so nice that I bought my little sister a bottle for Christmas and she loves it. She's a swimmer and always has problems with dry skin. I saw some reviews talking about the amount of product for the price point, a little of this stuff goes a long way and honestly compared to so many other brands this night cream is super affordable. I love CeraVe products, I don't know what I would do if they ever went out of business!!",4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,My dermatologist recommended this cream four years ago for my sensitive skin. Been using only this ever since. Does the job well.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Trying to figure out which skincare products did not burn my face or burn my eyes (or whatever) I found that my skin was flaky and dry in the morning - even though I was using a 'night cream'. This has changed the game for me though. Awesome stuff,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,This cream feels luxurious on the skin. I use it every day under my makeup and it never causes any issues. I think it makes my makeup look better.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,Im using this with the hyaluronic acid and the Gel oil and the difference in my face is MIND blowing I regret not doing a before and after picture! If you want SUPER SUPER SUPER soft skin and helps take the years off of your face then start using Cerave. I love that it doesn't smell which tells me they are focusing on the solution of skin and not pleasing a scent. GREAT JOB Cerave Ive used Hundreds of products and I've NEVER been this happy.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I have given this product so many opportunities but it's too much for my combo skin and to aggressive to use it close to my eyes. I tried using on dry spots but I didn't see any improvements. I don't like throwing full containers to the trash but I don't think I have any other use for this.,4.4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I have tried all of the expensive brands of night cream, only to become poor and disappointed. This cream had such good reviews everywhere, I decided to try it. I love how creamy, but not greasy it is. It has little or no smell and most importantly, it does the job on my dry winter face. I do not wake up with tight dry skin.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,"I have been using tret for a few years now. Love the results, but drying. Even before using, in the winter my skin was just so dry. Talking dry skin around the nose, tight/burning sensation, ick! For a coupon and tried this. O.M.G.!!!! I have tried so many different night moisturizers and none were ""it"" until this one. I wake up with my skin feeling moisturized, no more dry nose skin or icky feeling. I've found it!!",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream,I have tried the cerave pm lotion and the thicker moisturizing cream and this tiny purple bottle for whatever reason (maybe the shea) is the only one that doesn't sting my sensitive face. This will be my go to winter moisturizer after retinol from now on. I also hear it's a dupe for skinceuticals triple lipid repair so really it's not that expensive when you compare it to that one.,2,,

CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"I'm sure some would argue with me about this product not being for those with truly dry skin. And that's fine. Everyone is different and entitled to their opinion. I'm simply expressing mine, in the hope that it may help someone who needs more moisture than this can provide. The upsides of this product? Contains ceramides. Has a functioning pump, making application quick and easy while keeping the product free from contamination. It also absorbs quickly and won't leave you greasy, sticky or shiny thus allowing you to get dressed immediately after application. The downside? It simply doesn't contain the oils and occlusives that truly dry skin needs. No matter how many times you might reapply, it isn't going to do what a more emollient cream does. This isn't a CeraVe hate review. I have purchased this cream many times and some of their other products are among my favorites.

After some research it looks like the culprit could be Niacinamide, which can cause that reaction. Others seem to have experienced that same reaction with this product. So, if you have sensitive skin, you'll want to proceed with caution on this one!",4.6,,

It's lightweight and doesn't leave my skin feeling heavy, and it got rid of some of my blemishes on my forhead.(I had a knarly pimple and this helped) although it did give me small bumps on my forehead but they are barely noticeable.

It works well with both my TO 2% Salicylic Acid and 10% Lactic Acid serums as long as I give them both time to sink in and do their thing (I alternate nights, don't use them both at once).

CeraVe PM Lotion,"I have super dry skin. I struggle with eczema. This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist. When I first tried it, I wasn't super impressed. I didn't notice a huge difference overnight and planned on changing to a different moisturizer when it ran out. It ran out after a few months (it lasts a long time) and I noticed within a few weeks my skin was incredibly red and irritated. I went out a bought a bottle of this again and within a week, my skin was back to feeling and looking much better. I pair this with the CeraVe under-eye moisturizer and a seal it with a Shiseido oil. My skin still needs a little something else because it still feels dry but so far, this is the best combo I can come up with. This product isn't incredibly hydrating but I also think I have very dry skin compared to the average person. I'd recommend you at least try it!",1,,

I use it every night!",5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"I LOVE the Cera Ve eye cream and SPF day cream, but this one is really disappointing. I know it's ""light"", but I figured it would at least moisturize sufficiently. My skin doesn't feel tight or irritated anymore, but it's still DRY and even flaky, even if I apply this 4x throughout the day in addition to other products, which I wouldn't have to do if this was thicker maybe? If you live in a semi-arid place like I do (Colorado) and have skin that's on the drier side, I don't recommend this. I've also tried the overnight cream in a jar and it messed with my skins' texture.",4.6,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,It is light weight and I feel it is a good product.,5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"I have very oily dehydrated skin, and I hate the feeling of moisturizer. I found this product over 4 years ago and it is the only moisturizer that makes my skin feeling normal and not greasy. I use it all over my face (works great under Paula's Choice sunscreen), and is the only product that I can use under my eyes without causing milia. Now that I'm turning 30, I've begun using retinal and I've noticed that at times I wake up with dry skin. I've been doubling up this moisturizer with the skin skinfix triple lipid cream to see if it helps.",1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,Been using this forever and i love this. it's moisturizing and lightweight,2,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"This is a great moisturizer to use day or night and perfect for the summer too. I use the night time version during the day because I use Korean sun block, and because it wears well under make-up. This is also not too heavy if you have oily skin. Truly a great formula for all skin types.",5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,cleans & hydrates,4.6,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,My daughter uses this and loves it. She recommended it as it has a non greasy feel and works great. Plus it has a SPF 30.,5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"Lightweight, smooth application. I have combination skin so this doesn't really hydrate the dry parts for me so but my skin does feel smoother after use.",1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,66 years old. This product is not heavy or greasy. Did not make my combination skin break out. My skin stays hydrated all night. Fragrance free. I have to be careful with moisturizer because my skin is prone to breakouts. I am using it at night because of the cold weather and indoor heating which dehydrates my skin.,5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,Great addition to my skincare Routine I just wish it came in a larger size,5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"Feels good in any skin care Routine. It's lite, not greasy or sticky",4.6,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"I use this product for years, but not anymore. They must have reformulated because this product started giving me skin issues much like all of the other CereVe products. This is probably good for someone younger or people beginning their skincare journey with absolutely no underlying skin issues, but for the price there's so much better products you can choose from that won't cause irritation. I started to develop acne, rough patches, uneven skin tone, super dry skin, etc. This was no longer hydrating or helping my skin barrier, it was destroying it. I removed this product from my skincare routine and reevaluated. I have much better skin after doing my research and choosing better formulated products.",5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,I loved this product. It was super light and did not leave a residue on my face. Would definitely recommend. It was a bit pricy for my taste and would love it if it was just a tad bit cheaper. Other than that it was easy to find in the store.,1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"This moisturizer works, and is affordable. Has ceramides and other good ingredients, also a good barrier cream in winter, when dryness is at its worst.",5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"Tell me why this lasts so long? I got myself a bottle I believe in January, and it's still going. I love this stuff. The packaging is amazing too. Keeps my skin hydrated all night long. Never had a problem with this stuff.",1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,My skin literally broke out more after I started using it.,4.6,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"This night cream checks every box possible. It's the most affordable night cream on the market. You're getting twice as much night cream as, for example, the Est√©e Lauder night cream, but for a percentage of the price. Because of the size of the bottle, it lasted six months for me. It has clean ingredients. It even has hyaluronic acid in it, which helps prevents signs of aging. It's also super moisturizing, which is a necessary element especially in the cold, dry months. I would especially recommend this to people who either don't want to spend a lot of money on skin care or can't afford to. This night cream checks all of the boxes!",5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"I have tried them all, but this is the best. Keeps my 60 year old skin supple and soft, I use it morning and night after cleansing and toning. Highly recommend!",1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"I've used Lancome, Kiehl's, and Dermalogica. Im no stranger to Skin Care. For some reason, I had redness and dry skin. I stopped everything I was using and went back to basics. This is one thing I added. It truly turned my skin around. So happy",1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"I use this every single day-- morning and night. This is perfect for people with oily skin, and works even better than their day time cream.",5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,Work fine and the price is so much better than the other might creams. I haven't used it long yet but it feels nice on.,4.6,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,irritated my skin turn and burned red bad and has sulfates and silicones,5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"I don't know what kind of witchcraft went into the making of this lotion, but I cant even describe how much I love it. First, I'm fair skinned and suffer from photosensitivity. A few minutes in the sun WITH sunscreen usually still results in bumpy, itchy, inflamed skin (sun rash) and nothing helps like this lotion!! It's gone in a day. Applied it to my daughters severe sunburn in a pinch and it instantly cooled and lessened the redness dramatically! Use it every night and in the morning my skin is soft and plump (I'm 40). fine lines are less noticeable",1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"This is the only moisturizer that my oily, acne prone skin tolerates. I use it for am and pm. My skin does look a bit oily at the end of the day, but less so than if I'd gone barefaced, and it doesn't cause any acne. Even oily skin needs a moisturizer, and this is it! Can't beat the price either.",4,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,I bought this minimum 5x. It's the only moisturizer without fail that has resolved my flakey dry skin.,1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,I have incredibly sensitive skin and this doesn't even irritate/burn it! Lightweight. Doesn't absorb toooo quickly but if you use it in your routine right before you go to bed is just perfect. Not sticky. Doesn't require too much. Will buy again!,4.6,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"I bought this moisturizer because so many people recommend it to me for oily skin (actually, even here if you click on ""details"" tab it says it's good for oily skin). When using it, I always felt it was too much hydration for my oily skin. It was only after a long time of using it that I realized it says ""For Normal to Dry Skin"" on the left side of the box packaging. I felt lied to honestly, lol. Please make sure to read the packages (including the ingredients, if possible) of the products you buy.",5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,So yes the formula has changed but it's still great! Check ingredients though for allergies. I've been using this over and over for years and it's the best pm moisturizer out there! Really helps my skin stay hydrated and healthy! Just love how it's not greasy and more lotion/gel like feel for an oily t zone girly. Ps if you feel this is not hydrating enough you might be using a very drying cleanser! Happened to me when i first started using but changed my cleanser and this was never the problem! Your face should not feel dry after you clean it to begin with.,1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,keeps me moisturizef but not to heavy,5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,I was traveling and left my moisturizer at home so I just wanted to get by. I was pleased with how this moisturizer felt and worked. And the price was extra pleasing.,2,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,It's extremely lightweight and non greasy which is a big plus for me,4.6,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,I have combination skin and it spreads and absorbs quickly. It keeps my face feeling moisturized throughout the night.,5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,Your skin will feel renewed and moisturized when tou wake up in the morning,1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,the best moisturizer at an affordable price. I previously used a very expensive name brand and still had issues when I went for facials. now they tell me my skin is not dry and better nourished.,5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,i tried this and the am moisturizer and this is my favorite by far. i like the pump so i have a perfect portion of moisturizer every time. it absorbs quickly and calms my skin immediately. it feels amazing,5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,Not too greasy and doesn't break me out!,4.6,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,I love this product! It's very absorbent and feels moisturizing without feeling heavy or oily. I've only used it for a few days and already in love.,5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,This moisturizer is perfect to beat dry skin during winter months.,1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"I've used this product for a very long time since it is the only moisturizer that didn't brake me out but I notice that it started making my skin red every time I applied the product, but it would go away after a few seconds, I also notice that it is not very hydrating and it would make my skin very shiny and look dull throughout the day which is the opposite that I wanted from a gel moisturizer for oily skin. Recently changed it and my skin looks and feels so much better!",5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,It's affordable and very light weight. I hate feeling like heavy cream are on my skin but this feels amazing and makes my skin feel so soft. I also mix it with my ordinary brand products,5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,I put it on in the evenings after I take my shower I put it all over my face and down to my neck and it feels so hydrated.,4.6,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,Love this for pm moisturizer,5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"I used to have really dry skin. After I started using this, in about 2 weeks, my skin was always moisturized! I took this every night before I went to bed and I'd wake up with my skin feeling great. I love this stuff. I will buy again!",1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"Have been using this plus the AM moisturizer and face wash since recommended by my derm over 5 years ago. Love it, can't see myself switching anytime soon. Affordable, super light weight and nourishing at night, has never caused breakouts or dry skin, and recommend to everyone who ever asks me for mousturizer.",5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"I have very dry and thin skin and tried this lotion and I ended up with bad blemishes from it on my cheeks and jaw. I'm not prone to acne so it was a reaction to something in this. It also left my skin looking old, rough, and textured.",5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,This actually isn't moisturizing for me to use at night so I use it in the morning and the skin renew at night,4.6,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"This was highly recommended by my dermatologist and I like it as much as many of the more expensive products I've tried- maybe even a little more. For years I used the daytime CeraVe with spf 30 and will still use that during the winter months. All the CeraVe products were recommended by my dermatologist because I have very sensitive skin. It's fragrance free and has all the ingredients needed to keep your skin in good shape. I chose this over the one in a jar because it's not as heavy but has the same benefits, and even though I use a spatula, not my fingers, with a jarred product, I prefer a non-jarred product whenever possible.",5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,This has the same ingredients ( and fewer chemicals) than other similar products.,1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"I have combination skin, it is really really easy for a moisturizer to make my oily t-zone greasy, or it isn't enough for my dry patches. this is the only moisturizer that doesn't make my t-zone greasy and isn't moisturizing enough for my dry patches. It doesn't feel like a gross layer on the skin, it just melts in and moisturizes the perfect amount. I just wish that this product was made in a bigger size, I've repurchased this product like 3 times.",5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,I started using this a few nights ago and I've noticed mild rosacea on my cheeks and breakouts in my forehead and cheeks. It started getting worse by day. Maybe it's just my skin but when I discontinued this it got slightly better. I don't use it anymore. It may depend on your skin. But for me it was awful.,5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,I was playing around with my skin care routine and I normally went with la roche posay products but something about the moisturizer was irritating so In a pinch I saw this moisturizer and gave it a try. Fell in love with it. It doesn't cause breakouts(on me any way) and it doesn't hurt my face like some moisturizers have done. I use it for my morning routine because I'm not a fan of moisturizers with added spf which is what the AM one has. I use a separate spf.,4.6,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,"I see a lot of great reviews here, so unfortunately I believe I'm allergic to something in this or this moisturizer just didn't work out for me like others. onto the next one! ü•∫",5,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,I was looking for a light moisturizer without sunscreen. I have my own sunscreen I love and the usual 15 SPF isn't enough for me. This works great! It is light enough for the daytime and I love how it sits under makeup.,1,,
CeraVe PM Lotion,I really wanted to like this but i literally did nothing for my skin and made it more oily and caused flakiness !,5,,

CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser,"Man, I love this product so much before I used this I had very oily skin, especially on my T zone and I feel like every product I used shipped my skin very bad and caused me to break out even more, but this keeps my skin very well and has minimized a lot of my acne I have noticed a difference before and after and I wish I would've taken a picture but I recommended this for people with oily, sensitive skin because it has helped me with my skin and I would like others to try it as well.",4.6,,
CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser,"MY GRANDSON BEGAN GETTING PIMPLES SO I AM GIVING HIM THE CERAVE PRODICTS TO TRY. I USE CERAVE MYSELF, SO I KNOW HOW WELL IT WORKS. I FEEL IT WILL BE A GREAT PRODUCT FOR HIM TO START USING TO HELP HIM GET RID OF HIS TEENAGE PIMPLES. IT'S WORTH TRYING.",5,,

CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser,I spent so long wondering what was efomg with my skin. Spending money on more and more products to treat the horrible cystic acne this triggered on my face. When in actuality it was this wreaking havoc on my skin and the cetyl alcohol came up as a pore clogger.,5,,

CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser,"I try to avoid mechanical exfoliants (looking at you, St. Ives Apricot Scrub....) as much as possible as they're just too aggressive for me. I live in Michigan and, in the winter, my combination skin gets dry patches (especially between my brows and around my nose!). This takes off any dry/rough/flaky skin without any harsh scrubbing and does not leave any redness or patches. I follow it with Thayer's Witch Hazel toner for extra refreshing!",1,,
CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser,"I have dry, insanely sensitive skin. I tried this because it has both Ceramides and Salicylic Acid. CeraVe has a good reputation for those with sensitive skin, but I still had a reaction to this and it dried out my skin.",5,,

CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser,"This cleanser has been lifechanging for me, BUT you have to have patience! It took months and months to fully notice the changes this cleanser has brought in my skin. I have dry, sensitive skin, and when I used to get breakouts, they would be painful and longlasting, taking several weeks to go fully through each pimple's life cycle. Benzoyl peroxide is really drying for me so I hated having to use that constantly. I started using this cleanser (which doesn't dry me out at all), and now when i have breakouts, the pimples last a literal FRACTION of the time they used to! They cycle through in about 3 days now and I rarely have to use spot treatments anymore. I can't say enough about how well this has worked for me. Again, just remember you have to be patient and use this consistently over time! I do occasionally have sensitive skin flareups that this cleanser is too much for, so on those days, I switch to a gentle cleanser, but largely I've had zero issues with this one being too strong.",4.4,,
CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser,"I have super sentsitive combo skin. This cleanser removes makeup well without causing excessive dryness or breaking me out, but it doesnt really help prevent breakouts or exfoliate the way a stronger salicylic cleanser would.",5,,

CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser,"I got this Cleanser during the time when my skin had a few breakouts just to see if it would clear it up! While it did clear that initial breakout you should definitely expect a purge period! This Cleanser did have my skin broken out for about 2-3 weeks but after that had been absolutely amazing! It makes an imitate difference in how soft your skin is and deeply cleases pores! I had quite a few sebaceous filaments around my nose and this got rid of them completely which was worth the initial breakouts in my personal opinion! I do have oily skin that can tolerate just about anything I put in it and is not very sensitive at all so the fact that this broke me out does raise my concerns for people with sensitive skin trying this product so please consider that! But I would say over all this is a very good, affordable, and effective product!!! üëç",5,,
CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser,"My face has been more clear and also the texture on my forehead has improved alot, about 80% I'd say. So I would definitely recommend it to others. I used this for a week straight no other products added, just this and moisturizer and it works!",5,,
CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser,Too mild and salicylic acid is way down in the ingredients list. It broke me out after few days of use since im sure i was not getting any salicylic acid action on my skin! Do not recommend at all. Reallu disappointed since i love this brand!,4.4,,

CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser,"I've been using this cleanser about 2 weeks now and it does work for my oily combination skin. I can notice that my pores look a lot smaller and my skin feels smoother.

CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser,"Decided to try it out, but soon realized it wasnt for me. I have dry skin as well as very sensitive skin. Its hard tor me to try new products because my skin sadly doesnt agree with many. This product dried out my face as soon as i rinsed it off and made my face feel stiff. Within a couple of days I started with random cystic acne, but now after a week of having it my bottom half of my face is filled with cystic acne and little bumps.üò≠ Would not recommend for people witg dry/sensitive skin.",1,,

CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"CeraVe should market this as a makeup remover. This does a great job of removing long-wearing, full-beat makeup. I apply one pump to my face without lathering it first to break down the makeup, then wash a second time after lathering in my hands. I used Purity by Philosophy for 10 years- but this is better at removing makeup and is fragrance free! It does however dry out my normal/oily skin, so I don't think dry skin will like this as a cleanser.",4.4,,
CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"I have purchased this product several times as it does a good job of removing makeup - even breaks down waterproof varieties! - without being super harsh or drying. I have not found it to ""foam"" as much as I'd like but it does the job so I keep re-buying. Sometimes I have to wash 2-3x before it gets everything off, but I've followed a wash with a quick swipe of micellar water to get off any remnants of really stubborn makeup and it works very well. Will continue to buy!",5,,

CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,I have dealt with bad acne since stopping birth control when I was 19 and after SO MANY different brands after so many years (Almost 26 now) -THIS ONE WORKS. I tried CeraVe out after asking what my coworker what they use since their skin looked so clear and it was the best thing to happen to me. For the first time in years my skin looks clear and actually feels smooth and soft too! I use this and then I follow it up with the CeraVe Acne bottle then use my Tula lotion and Cerva Facial Toner. I have been doing this for a little over a year now and my skin just looks so healthy and it really eliminated my acne scars too. I also have really sensitive skin and this has never given me a bad reaction even when I first started out. I will say it took a few months of doing this on routine to get here but I AM HERE. It also is so great that CeraVe is so affordably priced. Thank you so much.,3,,
CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"My husband and I used this cleanser for 4 months. My skin was stripped of all its oils and was VERY dry. I have sensitive, combo skin. My husbands skin became irritated after 1 month of using it daily. He has red dots on his eyelid and around his eye (just one thankfully). I feel its due to this drying cleanser. This product also contains Titanium Dioxide which is known to cause the skin to become irritated and other skin conditions. I do NOT reccommend this product at all.",5,,

CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"I really enjoyed using this product to remove my full coverage makeup. I felt like it did remove everything after one wash. It did a really good job removing stubborn eye makeup like mascara and liquid liner. My skin was a bit dry afterward, but would use again.",3,,
CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"This is my go to cleanser. It leaves my skin feeling cleansed and moisturized without feeling oily. It is easy to dispense from the bottle and the scent is subtle and clean. It has all my favorite ingredients including hyaluonic acid, amino acids and ceramides. It truly has been a game changer for me, and I have repurchased numerous times because of its effectiveness! Not only is it a great product to remove your makeup, but also creates a protective skin barrier as well! I can't say enough good things, so if you want your skin left feeling rejuvenated while being cleaned, this is the product for you!",5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"I cant remember how many bottles did I buy from this cleanser. The texture is cream, I usually put the cleanser into the FOAM MAKER and add a little bit of water. After washing, i can tell my skin is clean but it doesnt rise out my natural moisture of my face. I have DRY and SENSITIVE skin.

CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"CeraVe Hydrating Cream-To-Foam Cleanser gives me the perfect balance of leaving my skin feeling clean but not stripped of moisture which I find happens way too often with most cleansers on the market. I had been using the Renewing SA Cleanser for about a year before buying a travel size version of the Hydrating cleanser and the first time I washed my face I thought I did something differently because my face wasn't tight/dry afterwards but clean, and hydrated! The price point for CeraVe is pricier, and some of the products you could find cheaper but for this specific product it is worth the price, and the bottle will last me a couple months with every day cleansing! The scent isn't overpowering, just a basic cleanser scent, doesn't have much of a scent but a clean scent is what it gives off to me.",5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Just finished my first bottle in 4 months and purchased another one right away! I use this to remove makeup and it works great!

I even took two days off of work because of how bad it got at first. Im slowly recovering but i still have dry cracked areas on my face and itchy bumps on my forehead.

I wear make up every day (I'm a cosmetologist) so washing my face and keeping it moisturized (age 43) is extremely important for my skin's health. No complaints!,4,,

It has skincare benefits such as hyaluronic acid, ceramides, glycerin that helps protects and hydrates your skin. I have combo, sensitive, acne prone skin. I'm also in my 30's. I love that it leaves my skin feeling clean, smooth, and not irritating. It starts out as a cream and when you massage it into your skin, it foams up. On its own, it won't remove all your make up, unless you double cleanse. I usually use dhc deep cleansing oil first and then wash my face with this cleanser and it works perfectly. Overall, it's my holy grail product - it's definitely a key first step to my skin care regime and it plays really well with other products.",4.4,,

CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"I promise once that purging period is over my acne is practically gone, the scars have cleared, and my skin feels sooooo good that I legit have clear, glowing, smooth skin! CeraVe did so well with this retinol, I'm in loveeeee! But, I'm not sure how other reviews are using this product but personally, I wash my face with the Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser, tone with the Hydrating CeraVe toner, apply this retinol on, and lastly, apply the La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+M Moisturizing Cream. The trick with retinol is that you have to wait out the purging and dryness period and pair this product with hydrating products, apply every third night or every other night, and APPLY SUNSCREEN in the day! Otherwise you will have issues with it like the other folks putting in bad reviews. Always do your research on how to pair it or put it on before diving in.",5,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"I have went through almost an entire bottle so far, using it twice daily. My face is starting to clear up and has not dried out at all. I am also using the resurfacing retinol serum. However, be cautious. This has caused ""bleach"" stains on several towels and shirts of mine.",5,,

Although, I still have some breakouts because its hormonal, but at least when I wash my face I feel less bumps and feels smoother.",5,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,Works well with skin that's sensitive and dries out easily. This is gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin and clears up my acne. Works great for summer back acne as well. I get the 4% . 10% is too strong for my skin.,1,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"After 3 months of use, I can conclude that this does not work. My derm prescribed me better topicals than this over the counter brand. I was looking for a cheaper alternative but my skin looks the same. Didnt fix any dark spots or wrinkles",4,,

CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,This has helped with old and new scars and just overall skin texture. My skin is much smoother and it layers well under my night and day lotion.,4.4,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"I started getting loads of hormonal acne last year going into my sophomore year, and hadn't found a product that actually helped my skin until i got this. I decided to use this product thanks to a girl online named aleyssa farrugia who also struggled with acne as well and recommended it, so I decided to give it a try, and im so thankful she put me onto this!! I've had less hormonal breakouts(I obviously still have breakout's but usually 1-2 pimples every few weeks to a month) and my skin has felt smoother with it. I have a relatively normal skin type so i have no problem using it twice a day but idk how it'll be for others. And it wasnt irritating at all until i recently decided to see a dermatologist and they also assigned me benzoyl peroxide gel, so i thought it using the face wash with the gel would make it, ' more effective' but it really just burned around my eyes and noseüò≠(but that was more on me and not on the wash, plus the gel itself was pretty irritating for me anyway). But disregarding that, its not irritating at all and i higly recommend it!!",5,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"I bought this after going through a few weeks of really bad breakouts. It cleared my larger red pus-filled pimples, but because it isn't non-comedogenic I started to get closed comedones. It definitely hydrates so I'll probably use the rest if this bottle sparingly when I get dry skin. I think a product marketed as treating acne should be made to not clog pores from the start though.",1,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,I've been using it for two weeks but please don't be like me and not read the instructions. A little goes a long way with this product. I saw results within the first three days. I love it but double cleansing with another product or excessive cleansing (more than 3 minutes) can cause a little burning and drying. Gradually increase usage . Moisturizer is a must.,5,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,I used this a lot when i first got it but i kept buying more products to see if i could find anything better but no matter what i bought every time i used this it always worked the best i used to have REALLY bad acne(but i didnt have cystic acne) and this cleared it up now i just have a small about of acne thank you CeraVe i dont even remember the last time i gave a product a 5 star review,5,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"Its good at preventing breakouts but not healing them. I wear makeup and oily/combo skin. I noticed i still feel a layer of oil on my face even after cleansing. And when i tone i still have dirt on the pad. It doesnt dry the skin out at all in my opinion, it has a very creamy texture",4.4,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,Unfortunately this product didn't work for me and broke me out in very cystic acne.,5,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"I used this as a spot treatment for my acne scars because im still considerably young, and when i used i canf believe the results. It healed my acne scars so well! And pretty great price for a retinol. Would def recommend!",1,,

CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"Some people are reviewing this as a cleanser. It is a retinol SERUM. It's effective at fading my acne scars, clearing acne, and great for regular use.

I only use this at night and it works wonders. Also, it's fragrance free!",1,,

CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"I have used other reintol products but this is by far my favorite. After one use, my skin was already brighter and my acne marks were much lighter. I had a bad break out right before the first time I used the retinol, but the next day my skin already looked like it was clearing. Really great for stubborn acne marks!",5,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"I had tried this product before and thought I was using it wrong so I made a schedule, use once a week for 3 weeks , then bump it up to twice a week for 3 weeks and see how we do with that. I know there can be a purge period. Im also aware of the drying affect it can have so I have simple hyaluronic acid moisturizer and serum on hand to use in conjunction. Unfortuantely even with all my patience and trust in the process I had acne in places like I was a teenager and fine lines and dehydrated skin like I was a person with mature skin (I'm in my late 20s). I have sensitive acne prone skin and I guess this one just wasn't it. Can't say I didn't try.",4.4,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"This got rid of my acne almost over night and has lightened my ancne scars. after just using it for a week, my face is baby soft. I highly recommend!",5,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"I do not have acne prone skin, but I am in my 40's and have heard so many things about how retinol helps with aging, texture, and just overall better skin; so I tried the most skin sensitive option I could find. I used it twice, and very sparingly, yet it has my skin SO burnt and itchy. Maybe it's just my skin but I've learned my lesson‚Ä¶I will never use this product (or any retinol) ever again.",1,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"I have combination, acne prone skin and out of all of the products I've tried this one has made the most noticeable difference on my skin. It works so well fading scars and preventing acne but doesn't dry me out like other products I've tried. I wake up with glowy, pretty skin whenever I use this! I will always repurchase this product it is so good.",2,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"I have been using this for about 2 weeks and i am so impressed at the difference it has already made on my face. I was using creams 3x the dollar amount with no change at all. I use cerave facewash and love it so i figured it wouldnt hurt to try especially for the price. Oh boy am i glad i made that decisions! My face is smoother, brighter and softer. I have stubborn dark acne scars/spots on my cheeks and they are basically gone now. This stuff is amazing. Only thing i recommend is to not put it anywhere near your lips. I got some in the corners of my mouth and it did burn it slightly and cause it to be raw. Other than that spot i have had no bad reactions! I love it!",5,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,Everytime I use this product it leaves my face red and with a burning sensation. I dont feel like it makes me skin feel clean or soft after using it.,4.4,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"After about 2-3 weeks of using this product and have already notice improvement in my mild acne, combination skin. It has smoothed out my previously bumpy skin and I notice this product gradually strengthening my skin barrier. I have also noticed a small amount goes a long way!",5,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"I've been using the AM PM and retinol serum every day for about 3 months and I've noticed a huge differnece. My entire skincare routine is a mincellar water wipe down of my face, then two pumps of the AM SPF moisturizer in the morning. At night before bed, I use the mincellar water wipe to wipe my face then apply two pumps of the PM moisturizer and one pump of the retinol serum at the same time that i mixed together on my finger. Its been 3 months and many of my acne scars are gone or going away, my pores are significantly less clogged they look significantly smaller as well. I still get pimples around my period, it's not preventing anything, but it helps for after. I also have been using it faithfully for 3 months and i still have plenty left.",1,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,The directions on this product here says to use it with the Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser. That has Benzoyl Peroxide in it. Make sure you do your research before you even use anything with Retinol in it. You aren't supposed to even mix it with AHA/BHA/Benzoyl Peroxide/Vitamin C/Glycolic Acid and more. You can use it with Hyaluronic Acid though. Retinol is very strong so only do it once a week when you first start. And slowly go up once your skin gets use to it. And make sure you MOISTURIZE!!!! Do not go without moisturizer. That is a must. Just make sure you research before using any products you've never used before. üíï,1,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,I love this and im purchasing again. I use it in the shower to leave it on for 1-2mins and so I can make sure its fully rinsed off and doesnt dye my towels. I have sensitive bit acne prone skin and with a great full skincare routine it doesnt strip my moisture barrier.,5,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,This has helped my skin so much when I ever I use it my face feels so nice and clean and not oily!!,4.4,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"This was recommended by my dermatologist and I've been hooked ever since. When I have a breakout, it dries up the pimples before they get larger and calms the redness if I pop them. Gives a good clean feeling without being too drying.",5,,
CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum,"I have oily skin and have always struggled with hormonal acne, and i have an impressive amount of acne scars, blackheads, and overall problematic skin. One thing i must note about this product that is often misunderstood, this WILL make you break out. This is a resurfacing product, meaning it will bring bacteria/buildup/gunk thats deep in your skin up to the surface to get rid of it. In a sense your skin will get worse before it gets better, but trust the process. This is called ""Skin Purging"" and is a very common process that happens with products that work. Ive used this product for months, maybe about 4 to 5 months, and i had skin purging for about 1 month until my skin finally calmed down. All in all, your skin gets worse before it gets better, and be sure to wear sunscreen and gentle calming products on your skin along with this. This product is very gentle feeling on your skin but trust the process! I highly recommend, especially for those naggy pimples that arent poppable but still visible and irritating to look at.",1,,

CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,"I have used this product for yeeaaarrrss. Multiple dermotologists reccomended CerAve to me and it has worked when my skin was super greasy and acne prone and works now that I have clear, drier skin. I've always had really sensitive skin and this never breaks me out or irritates me. I do find that a bit of translucent powder post application can help with any greasiness from the SPF.

CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,Ive been using this product for a few years and have loved it. Last bottle i bought was in December and worked great. Bought a new bottle in September and it just pills and rubs off my face. Super disappointed because my skin loved it before!,4,,
CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,"for everyone saying it peels.... one little pump goes a longgggg way!! when i first used this moisturizer, i used 2 pumps and it was waaaay too much. i definitely experienced the peeling too. lol but since ive been using it more lightly its absolutely perfect!!",5,,
CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,A feel good north rider,1,,
CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,"I had high hopes for the CeraVe AM Face Moisturizer, but it fell short in almost every way. First, the texture is thick and leaves a noticeable white cast on the skin, which is a huge problem if you have a darker complexion or are in a rush and don't want to spend time blending. It also doesn't absorb well, sitting on top of the skin and leaving it feeling greasy throughout the day. The worst part, though, is that it pills on the skin no matter what I use underneath it‚Äîwhether it's a serum, another moisturizer, or even just bare skin. It forms clumps and flakes off, making my face look dry and uneven. This completely ruins any makeup application or just leaves your skin looking awful on its own. To top it off, the pump bottle is frustrating, as it stops working long before the product is empty, wasting a lot of the lotion. Overall, this product caused more problems than it solved and definitely didn't live up to its reputation. There are far better options out there.",1,,
CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,"I've used this particular facial lotion for years as my #1 daytime moisturizer. I've never had any issues before until this last batch I ordered. It pills so bad! No matter what I do or don't do. I've used it without any serums or primer, still pills. I've used it on both freshly clean skin and on skin that was just hydrated with water previously, still pills. And forget using it under makeup. Not only does it pill but it barely hydrates. I also have recently noticed more sun spots on my face, so I'm thinking the SPF is off in this batch too. Too late to return so I'm stuck with it.",5,,
CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,honestly I hate it. it leaves white streaks on my face and it causes separation on my makeup. sometimes when I put it on it just starts pealing off like as if it was your skin after using a body scrub. I use the night one for day and night and recomend,4,,
CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,"I really wish i liked this product. Whats nice is it doesnt break me out, but it pills so horribly. Ive tired having it be the only product on my skin..pills. Ive tired with a serum‚Ä¶pills. Ive tried with a moisturizer‚Ä¶ pils. There are a lot of other facial spfs that dont pill for a similar pirice and more spf.",5,,
CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,"Horrible consistency, it's just like sunscreen but oilyer.",1,,
CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,"Pills,smells bad,not good at all!!!!",1,,
CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,Perfect daytime moisturizer. Has sunscreen. Does not leave my face feeling oily.,2,,
CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,"This SPF moisturizer works fine, but it doesn't rub in if your face has any moisture whatsoever (such as slight dampness after a shower, or a very fine sweat). Additionally, I've found that it causes my face to run hot and sweat more when I'm outside, and then the sunscreen just runs off. Overall, the CeraVe Lightweight SPF Moisturizer works far, far better than the regular SPF Moisturizer. It's worth the upcharge, as it has none of the issues I've described above.",4,,
CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,"i have acne prone combo/oily skin and this works. u must work and rub it in to avoid leaving a white cast, but it goes away if u keep massaging. not the most hydrating but i use this daily and its never caused a bad reaction",5,,
CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,"I normally love cerave but this product is horrivle. White cast (and i have very pale skin) so you have to rub it in super hard, which then causes pilling",1,,
CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30,this is HORRIBLE. i had to add moisturizer because of how bad the white cast was and that didnt even work.,3,,

I like it so much that I felt like I had to spread the gospel after seeing the negative reviews here.

I have combo skin and it does dry my skin out a bit but not to the point that its stiff or uncomfortable - I just pair with a light moisturizer. My skin feels clean, but not stripped. Would totally recommend for anyone with mild acne. Love u cera ve",4.3,,
CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,the app has the wrong ingredients listed for this product,4,,

CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,This product is very lightweight on the skin there is not scent to this product what do ever the packaging is not bulky so it no that had to have in a bag we're it is taking up space there is 2% salicylic acid for acne in this product the pricing is great on this product I have had this bottle for 5 months and it still has product and when u travel with this product it doesn't spill because u can turn the pump and it will lock,4,,

They hurt, theyre under the skin, they leave horrible dark marks. My skin has been going through it and i dont know why. Anywho i knew when nothing else worked i needed to go back to 2% salicylic acid. Thats been my best friend since i discovered it early in my 20's. It ALWAYS works to clear my face and its done it again. Its only been 4 days since getting this and my skin is looking so much better. No active breakouts right now, it dried all those up and will continue to help stop more from producing. I need to stick with products like these. Should have never doubted",4.3,,

CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,"I bought this product hoping that it would help with some breakouts that I have been having. However, after just one use, my face was covered in small bumps, and it has now been three days and the bumps are still there. I'm honestly not sure what to do about it. I have heard about the idea of skin purging, but I am terrified to keep using the product based on these results after the first use. This product may work well for people with different skin texture and dryness level, but it just didn't work for me. I will definitely have to consult with a dermatologist before continuing with this product. I'd love to find a cleanser that works for me and controls breakouts. This one is just not it.",1,,
CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,"CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser is a game-changer! As someone with oily, acne-prone skin, I've tried countless cleansers, but this one stands out. Its formula, enriched with salicylic acid and niacinamide, effectively targets breakouts without stripping the skin. It's gentle, non-drying, and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. Plus, it's fragrance-free, which is a big win for sensitive skin. Highly recommend for anyone battling acne!",5,,
CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,It works great! I have been using this for years and it always keeps my skin clear and it doesn't dry it out either. This product is also affordable.,5,,
CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,It's not as harsh as other acne treating face wash. It cleans but doesn't make it all super dry. I have very sensitive skin but I'm using twice a day no problem. It is a really good and gentle face wash and it doesn't make my face oily. It actually helps my face from being oily.,4.3,,
CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,"I originally got this product to use all over my face for acne and blackheads. It gave me some purging which i knew might happen, but was just too irritating for my sensitive skin. Ive found that it works amazingly as a night time spot treatment though, especially for those under-the-skin painful cystic pimples. Calms them down by the next morning, and in another day or two theyre either gone or have come to a head to where i can use a pimple patch.",4,,
CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,Great option for when I'm having hormonal breakouts! Very hydrating and light! Helps get makeup off my face without irritation! I love this stuff!,1,,

CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,This product along with the acne gel made my Acne so much worse! I have been using it for 6 weeks now in the hope that the break outs would eventually settle. I previously had acne on my cheeks but this has made it spread all over my face. I have now given up with these products.,4,,
CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,"I only buy it in a bottle with a dispenser, it is very convenient to use and is always a large size, my son uses this, he is a teenager, it is very suitable for that age for acne and cleanses the skin well.

CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,"when I found this I stopped looking for another face wash to control breakouts! You can't beat the price, I've spent $60 + on acne cleansers previously that didn't work as well. Isn't drying to your skin which is huge for me as I'm also dealing with aging skin.",1,,
CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,"I've been using thing product for around a week, I completely changed up my cleansing routine, I use to use just cheaper novelty products. Am I use hydrogen water gel cleanser, followed by a toner, then salicylic acid serum followed by a tinted moisturizer (it cosmetics) or cerave blemish control gel and then a SPF 50 in the PM I use the same cleanser, toner, hydraulic acid serum, acnecide 5% cream and finally cerave blemish control gel, my skins complexion has really changed this routine has done wonders for my pores, blackheads and blemishes definitely worth investing into a good cleansing routine to see results the only criticism I have is the cerave gel can feel sticky",5,,
CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,I have al lot acne in my face i used acne gel for 4..5 days with acne cleanser but my face not shown any difference I observed that my face shown worse condition and acne also worse condition that under my skin i feel prone acne in my face and stubborn acne also after use it plz guide me what can i do,5,,

CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,Good affordable cleanser. Helps with my acne but i haven't seen a difference for blackheads. I also like that it's unscented and makes my skin feel really clean. The only thing i will say isthat it is kinda stripping and dries out my skin is i use it more than 3 times a week.,4,,
CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser,I love it but I'm super inconsistent so if you want full results use everyday or every other day. Got it about a month ago It's great but if you keep it on your skin too long your face starts to tingle. Smells really good. Also I love the teal color on it,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I've been using CeraVe products for many years with no issues, so I thought I'd give this a try. I bought it at another retailer. I was using it over a three week period, a couple times a week, and last week my face started to have a perioral dermatitis flare! I haven't had a flare this bad in YEARS! I was concerned the retinol might be too harsh, but it was listed far down on the list so I was hoping it would be ok. Nope, not ok, and now my once clear skin is covered in blistery, weeping bumps.

CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I have tried other retinol products in the past and would get a rash on my face. I've had zero irritation with this product. My skin feels so smooth and my dermatologist even complemented the texture and appearance of my skin at my last visit! That felt great almost being 50!,4.3,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I had cystic acne during my teens and most of my 20's. I spent thousands of dollars in Dermatologist and other treatments. My acne was mostly in my nose that left me with deep scars. The last dermatologist I visited recommended CeraVe Products and I have used them for the past 3 or 4 years, mainly the face wash and face lotion. After 2 pregnancies my skin has taken a toll so I have more attention into my face. I use this product combined with CeraVe PM face lotion and I am very happy with the results! I combine with other CeraVe products rotating during the week such as CeraVe Skin Resurfacing Retinol Serum (blue one).",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I love CeraVe and this one doesn't disappoint. Goes on smooth and doesn't irritate.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,Super creamy and not sticky. I mix with the resurfacing serum.,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"This was my first attempt at a product with retinol in it, and it doesn't disappoint. I'm in the process of clearing up my face and this is so soft on my skin. It can burn from time to time (depends on which mask I use before), but Im able to use this twice a day like the bottle suggests without drying out.",4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I bought it in september before I needed it. I went to use it 2 weeks ago and it won't pump. It does work for my skin.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"One of my frustrations with retinol can be unpleasant smell and added caffeine (not good for a cream you use before bed). This one is light weight, no smell, and I fall asleep fine. I don't think the ""wrinkle reducing power"" is as strong as other creams I have used, but it is reasonably priced for my other needs.",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I'm a newbie to using retinol creams, but I figured I'd give this a try. I've seen results in the first 2 weeks. I've been using this and CeraVe eye repair cream. I'm impressed.",4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I love their products and use them nightly. I was so happy when they came out with a retinol. I have super sensitive skin and it's the only brand that works for me. I opened it and tried to apply the first night that I got it and I must have pumped 100 times and nothing came out. It was either empty or the pump had issues. I've repurchased and hoping the next one works better!,4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I have only been using this product for a week but so far my highly reactive, sensitive skin hasn't complained. It usually takes two weeks for my skin to react but I use many of the Cerave skin products and they are the only products that my skin can handle. Hoping to see some results from this retinol serum. I will buy it again if I see results and don't react to it.",4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"didn't diminish my fine lines around eyes, forehead or laugh lines. leaves skin feeling soft and moisturized but didn't really address the lines themselves. I saw better results when switching to LA roche posay retinol from ulta, it came as a sample but I liked it so much I bought one.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,It's very absorbent but not drying in any way. It leaves my skin soft and smooth with no irritation on my sensitive skin.,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,Takes a couple of weeks but definitely tell the deference. Highly recommend!,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I love this product is one of my go to on my daily routine. Highly recommended,4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I couldn't believe how quickly I saw a change in my skin. You would never know this was such an affordable product.,4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,Have used for a while. Good to keep skin soft and smooth without being oily. Use nightly.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I use the serum in am and night. Is amazing for my routine.,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,This is my first time using retinol and I have more dry sensitive skin. I've been worried to try retinol for fear of irritation but this has been great. Started using every other day and now every day and I've noticed a huge difference! My husband says my crows feet are less noticeable!,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,Did not make me break out so that's great.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,Love this stuff. You only need a small drop and I used only for two days and seen a difference. Very mild on skin no redness or dryness.,4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I have very sensitive skin and struggled with acne's after getting off bc. This is such a good buy, you can feel and see a difference within a night. My skin has not been clearer and less irritated.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I should've listened to myself and invested in a better retinol. I know the formula isint good when my skin started breaking out! If you have sensitive skin , domt waste your money, invest in the good stuff",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I have only been using it for about a week but I do feel that I see a difference and I like the product! Has no scent and is easy to use/ apply. I will continue using this and probably buy it again. Affordable price and great product :),5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I love this so much it makes my skin glow and make me look younger,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"Using for first time. I'm big on skin care, it shows.",4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I usually use Cerave Resurfacing Retinol Serum but decided to try this one. I'm not prone to break outs but had terrible red, blistery breakouts. I love Cerave products but not this one.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,Si funciona,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,Use it twice a day and am so pleased with the results!,4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I just finished my first bottle and it has been a roller coaster. It left my skin looking bright and healthy before inevitably causing it to purge. If I allowed myself to go through it, my skin would most likely look incredible by now. I wish I had that kind of patience. I plan on buying this product again, but hopefully with more restraint.",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I meant to buy the resurfacing product but bought this one by mistake and I'm pleased despite it not being the product I wanted to buy. I think my skin has a brighter tone and a smoother texture to it.,4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I don't have anything good or bad to write about this product. It didn't cause breakouts, redness, or irritation‚Ä¶ it didn't really do anything. I've been using it for a month now and there are been no noticeable changes in my fine lines or overall skin health. It's a fairly cheap retinol cream, so it's worth a try if you're interested. I do recommend mixing it in with your moisturizer in case you do have skin sensitivities because retinol can cause irritations.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I have sensitive combo skin and this product caused really bad breakouts. Painful cystic acne that I' haven't experienced since I was a preteen. I used it for about 3 1/2 weeks and I'm stopping use today. My skin complexion was more even and bright before I used this product. No acne breakouts whatsoever before I used this product, just uneven skin complexion and a little dull. I was just looking to try something new for a little extra, radiance and skin texture benefits. I believe it's related to the niacinamide in this product. I've used niacinamide before and the same thing happened. I believe I have a sensitivity to it. Again, I was interested in this products claim to improve skin texture and radiance. Which it did nothing of the sort. My skin looks horrible now and I'm going to have to add a few acne related products into my routine until my skin calms down. Which is going to likely dry my skin out. This product threw a monkey wrench in my routine. ü•¥ If you are looking for the same thing as me I would suggest Ceraves Vitamin C serum and a snail cream. I used the vitamin c serum for over six months now and I do see a benefit. Snail cream has also helped even my skin before without breaking it out. Taking this out of my routine right away.",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I tried it for a month and it doesn't work. I use other retinols regularly and this wasn't it,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I got zero results after using this product. It also feels like it doesn't absorb well even with correct amount of product used,2,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,This product is wonderful!!!! I apply it at night after washing my face and in the morning with makeup . Let me tell you i don't use any primer and use this instead and my makeup looks so beautiful. My pours do not show anymore when applying foundation. I have sensitive skin and also dry spot and it just makes my skin feel so nice !,4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I've struggled with hormonal acne literally my entire life. I've tried every medication, serum, acid, peroxide, and treatment under the sun and never seen results like this. I bought this for preventive wrinkle care, eased into it starting twice a week mixed with moisturizer. It made my acne worse at first, and right when I was about to ditch it 3 weeks later, I noticed how clear my skin was getting. A good skin day for me used to be 3-5 zits around my mouth area at a time. I now only get 1 small zit a week, if any. Highly recommend!",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"Listen, I've tried tons of high end products and still my skin always felt like it was missing something. I decided to give this a try when I saw it at my ulta store and let me tell you this stuff is amazing!! I'm only 23 so I didn't know if I needed the wrinkle benefits it offers. However, just after one week my skin was softer, brighter and tighter. I tend to struggle with sun spots and now my skin tone has evened out. Will be purchasing another bottle!",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I'm on the fence about this product. I can't speak much to results, because I'm only 21 so I'm using this as a preventative measure for aging. I will say I have acne scars that don't seem to really be going anywhere after 2 months of using this. Also, I do NOT like the way it goes on. It feels really sticky and it's hard to distribute around my face because of that. I'm going to finish the bottle, but I might look for something else after that.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,Definitely buy it again,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"Love this retinol serum!!!! It's gentle yet so effective! I saw the difference in my skin after 1 use. My frown lines appeared to be little smoother and the overall tone of my face seemed brighter. I've tried different brands of retinol serums and I think this serum is, by far, my favorite. It's so reasonably priced and so effective~~ a win win combination! Highly recommend!!!",4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I started using this product 1 week ago & I can already see a real difference - the redness in my face is almost gone!,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I see a difference already I recommend this !!,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"cleanse, apply hyaluronic serum, then apply this Cera Ve retinol serum, then moisturize",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,Let me start by saying I'm blessed with great skin. My skin type is normal and I don't get acne. I wanted to start using a retinol for the anti aging properties. After the first night I noticed my skin was so soft and any texture I had was gone. After about 3 weeks of using every other night I can say this is a holy grail product and I will be repurchasing.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I was skeptical at first, because I usually spend more on skin care but am pleasantly surprised that after a few days my skin appeared brighter, and felt softer to touch without much irritation. I'm anxious to see the changes in the next month. I did use a moisturizer on top of the serum to help with dryness and of course don't forget the sunscreen",4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I used to be a skin care snob. Only tje expensive stuff for me. I noticed that my skin was feeling dry even and did some research. I got a sample of the night renewing and cleanser. Now I ise the whole line of Cereve. Why did I waste all that money? This stuff works just as well maybe even better! Never going back.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I'm a gal who loved the sun in my younger years and I have subtle lines around my eyes to prove it. This product, in one week, has softened those lines with a subtle plumbing effect and has brightened my skin. My 11 year old daughter actually told me my skin was glowing... and outs pretty much say what's on their minds. Lol. Biggest tip? Use a small dab in each area and fully massage it in. I then layer my day/night moisturizer over it. It leaves my skin feeling quenched, not greasy. Love it.",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I purchased this to help with small lines and moisturizing my face. Unfortunately it did just the opposite. I will admit that you tightened every spot on my face but that's only because it dried it out so much that I literally looked like I had a sunburn and my face was cracking. It turned my face red and began to peel. I don't know if I had a reaction or if it's just not the right product for me. Either way, this definitely did not work well for me. Sorry‚Ä¶",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I use every night after cleansing my face. Soaks right in never feels greasy.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,We will see,4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,Great product bought on a whim and I'm so glad I did!,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"Use it before my moisturizer, it's my first retinol and I love it! I didn't experience any negative side effects or stinging like I've heard can happen with retinol.",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"This product is priced well and though I haven't been using it for long, it seems to be working well so far! It's gentle on my skin and easy to apply. I will likely purchase it again.",4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I had purchased this to add a retinol to my routine again that I could just throw on before my moisturizer and rose hip oil. Works great with all my other products and I plan on repurchasing this,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"CeraVe is a great line of products. As a mature lady I am careful what I put on my skin. Not a fan of all kinds of chemicals to look good in my skin care and makeup. This does not sting or cause redness. It does a nice job on my skin. You don't need a lot, pump it out, smooth it on and that's it. The bottle is small for the price, but for me it is a clean product recommended by my dermatologist.",4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"Clean, non-fragrant cream serum, the serum absorbs quickly. Does stay a little tacky on skin, let it dry about 5 or 6 minutes before applying any moisturizer.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I hate giving a bad review, and I hardly ever leave reviews unless I feel strongly about something. Suffice it to say, I feel strongly about this one and feel I have to write something since they changed the formula up and I don't want people to have issues and wonder what the heck the old reviews in 2019 and years before were talking about. The original formulation in the tube was amazing. I'm in my early thirties, have combination sensitive skin (t-zone oily, everything else drier than the Sahara and it gets irritated easily), and I have a simple skincare routine that I had perfected and have specific products that I've used for a few years to minimize milia and breakouts in the t-zone and keep everything else on my face happy and moisturized enough. This stuff was my holy grail when it came to a serum. Then they changed this to the pump bottle and dropped the ""cream"" part from the name so it's just the ""skin renewing retinol serum"", which started happening right around December 2019. Okay, that was a little worrying. But I might as well try it out since I didn't really have a choice, as the original was suddenly impossible to find anywhere. I hoped for the best and that it wouldn't mess up my routine and it'd still be my HG and keep my skin happy. Point blank - It's not the same and it made my skin angrier than it's been in a long while. This is the only product I've used in the last few years that changed. After I started using the new one, I immediately started having issues with milia in my t-zone and major acne breakouts on my cheeks and chin that were reminiscent of my teen years. Not hard to figure out the new formula of this product was the issue. Really disappointed in Cerave for changing this and it looks like I'm going to have to experiment yet again to find something that works. For anyone looking at this or other products by this brand, just be aware that Cerave has been reformulating almost all of their products lately, so take any older reviews with a grain of salt and spot check to make sure you don't have issues.",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I use this at night after washing my face. I apply, let dry and then use a heavy cream. I also apply to neck. Very good results except on forward which is slightly oily. My neck is much smoother and my skin is looking better every day. The results aren't instant. It took about a month to see results",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,So far so good. I ordered this & another kind to test the difference. I will update when I'm done testing .,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"Love this serum, I use it with the CeraVe vitamin c serum and their skin renewing night cream. My skin is so much brighter and even toned than it used to be. Have not seen a significant difference in the creases in my forehead, but I have around my eyes. I'm sure this will continue to get better as I continue to use. I have been using these products for about 3 months and I will continue to use this line of products!",4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"This is a great retinol, It doesn't irritate my skin and I can see a difference in the texture and clarity of my skin.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,On my second tube.,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I purchased this serum a few weeks ago while desperately searching for an affordable hydrating serum - I have pretty dry skin and no matter how great my skin care routine was I would have visible dry patches on my nose and forehead in the mornings while applying makeup (not a cute look). This serum has made a noticeable difference in my makeup application but more importantly just with the overall look and feel of my skin. I'm a fan, and I'll definitely repurchase after this puppy runs out",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I purchased the CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Cream Serum because it was recommended for fine lines and wrinkles. Specifically I was looking for a product that would help minimize forehead creases and frown lines. I used the CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Cream Serum for over a month, applying to my forehead twice daily per product instructions. During the day I wore the product under makeup, and at night just with moisturizer (both allowing the product to fully absorb before applying anything else). The product is easy to apply, absorbs quickly, is not greasy, and has no unappealing odor. So far I have seen zero change in the appearance of my forehead creases and frown lines. Perhaps my creases are too far gone for this product to help, but for me, it is not worth purchasing again.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"First let me say that I really love all the CeraVe products I've tried in the past. I liked this one at first too--it feels hydrating and smooth on the skin, though thicker than I would expect from a serum--but it pills up after an hour or two. I do layer it with other skincare (CeraVe moisturizer/SPF in the morning and cream and oil at night), and I don't feel like it's enough to just use by itself. I've tried applying the other products immediately, I've tried letting it dry first--still pills up. If I sweep my hand across my face I get a handful of crumbles. It's really frustrating because I did want to like this, but it's all but unusable for me due to the texture. Oh well. (For the record, I used this to minimize texture and sebaceous filaments around my T-zone, not for wrinkles, so I can't speak to its anti-aging ability.)",4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,broke me out it feels nice and hydrating but beware of breakouts,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,Wow after just one week I see such a difference in the fine lines in my forehead and near my brows! I've tried so many products and this is by far one of the best!,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I do not like this product. First off, I have been using it for a month now. I do not see or feel any sort of difference in my face whatsoever. It is greasy and smells like my grandma's perfume. The more I use it, the harder it is to dispense the cream. I can't even get one little dot to come out. So tonight, as I'm squeezing the tube that obviously has a lot of cream left in it, trying to get a little dot to come out to apply, the cream explodes out of the backside of the tube all over me and my bathroom. I'm so frustrated that I even spent money on this. Into the trash it goes! I feel like I'm crazy because I bought this due to the excellent reviews, but that's my experience. 10/10 would not buy ever ever again.",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I purchased this item because it says ""...Retinol Cream"". When I got home, and was reviewing the Ingredients List, to my disgust, there was No retinol in the ingredients list. Can the manufacturer point to us where in the Ingredients List does it say there is Retinol?",2,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,I bought this product to try out because it was a more affordable serum for fine lines. I really liked it and am going to order it again after I finish this review! I have extremely oily skin and this stuff absorbed in my skin with no problem at all. I definitely recommend this stuff!,4.3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum,"I use this in the morning and at night. I love how it leaves my face feeling moist but not ""greasy "".",5,,

I'm worried about new hyperpigmentation marks forming from the burns. FYI I used a SPF daily, heavily incorporated a peptide serum, & even doubled up on my moisturizer and it still managed to negatively affect my skin.",5,,
CeraVe SA Cream,"This CeraVe cream helps with smoothing the tiny bumps I have on my upper arms and neck area. It feels very moisturizing and is fragrance free. I only use it once or twice a week, and it is enough to keep my bumpy skin looking smooth for a few days. It comes with a good amount that will last.",1,,
CeraVe SA Cream,"I would just like to say I really enjoy Cerave as a brand overall, it has very clean ingredients and works great for me. This lotion has helped with the tiny bumps that I get on my forearms, they are really tiny and this has smoothed my arm out. The best combination is using the SA body wash and following up with the SA cream, right out of the shower. This lotion has a thick texture which makes me feel extra moisturized as well. Overall, great product and great brand!",4.6,,
CeraVe SA Cream,Terrible.Used once burnt my skin.I had to shower off imeaduately,5,,
CeraVe SA Cream,Love this! I have KP and was recommended by my sister to use this. It's been really helpful in reducing the appearance of the bumps. I use it alongside a glycogen acid toner. It's also nice for the occasional body acne. Absorbs well and doesn't have a weird smell.,1,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,Love how this feels on my skin.,4,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,"I would use this during the day, since my other eye cream has retinol, and I didn't want to have retinol on my undereyes during the day. Yes, it's moisturizing, but now my undereyes are covered in milia! It doesn't matter how much/little I used, it just created more! So mad that I wasted my money on this and now have to suffer woth noticable bumps.",4,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,Cerave was reccomended to me by two different dermatologists and I've been using their other products for years and started using this in the last couple of years and have repurchased a few times. I used to have pretty bad under eye circles but I feel like it has seriously helped over time. I don't feel the need to even wear concealer anymore. I have super senstive post-isotretion skin by the way!,3,,

Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,"While I normally love CeraVe products (I use their cleanser everyday) this eye cream does not work AT ALL. It moisturizes, sure. But as for getting rid of the dark circles? No. I just took a picture and saw my under eye dark circles are actually worse!!!!! Will be buying a different product",4,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,This eye cream burned when I put it under my eyes. Very disappointing.,4,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,Dont wait go now,3,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,"I used this cream exclusively until the tube was almost gone not thinking anything of it. Then I switched to something else and was wondering why I was looking so tired all the time. It only dawned on me when I found this old,almost empty,tube.",1,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,"I have been using this for about 4 or 5 months now and I honestly don't notice a difference. I don't use it consistently, but I do use it often as I have puffy dry eyes all the time. the dryer my eyes are, the more it burns, but it does help heal the flaking inflamed skin. does nothing at all for my dark circles.",1,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,I have really dry undereyes. Its to the point that sometimes i get a red itchy dry patch under my eye. I recently bought this to try it out as i wanted to change my eye cream. I took it with me when travelling and on the plane I got a dry patch. I was panicking because I had a wedding to go to and I did not want the patch to ruin it. Usually it takes about a week if not longer to go away. This cream made it go away within a few days and my makeup went on smoothly on the day of the wedding. It does reduce puffiness and it hydrates/moisturizes amazingly. I havent seen a huge change in my under eye circles with this product but i have only been using it for about a month. If you have dry eyes this is THE holy grail. My under eyes have never been smoother and more hydrated.,4,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,This product did absolutely nothing for me.,4,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,"I would not recommend this product to anyone, regardless of skin type. Purchased a few months back and had a severe reaction to it, at first I thought it was just standard pollen allergies (itchy and watery eyes) but by the 3rd day of using this product I woke up to my under eyes being incredibly swollen and unbearably itchy, the skin under my eyes was swollen like a bee sting and felt very VERY dry to the touch. Almost scale-like. I had to take an antihistamine to reduce the swelling and even after that it took around two weeks for the itching and dryness to stop. To be clear; I have never in my life had a reaction to any cosmetic or skin care product and I have no history of allergic reactions of this nature. I have used the CeraVe facial moisturizer in the past with no issue and a couple years ago even tried this same eye cream and had no reaction to it, so my only guess is that the formula has changed in the last couple years. I would not risk using this and highly recommend you avoid it. While I've had no issues with their facial moisturizer, I no longer trust any CeraVe product and will not be repurchasing from them in the future.",3,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,"I love cerave, but this messed up my eyes. I only used it twice and knew i needed to stop immediately. it burned both times and then the day after the second time of use my eyes were flaky dry and under eyes are red with these scratch/scar like RAW lines under my eyes. Its been 4 days and my eyes still are red and the lines are still there, I think it burned the creases under my eyes and now im going to have scars üò≠ Id return it but i dont have the time or energy to a store rn with how bad my eyes look. I got this because nothing else was what I was needing and budget friendly so I thought this would be perfect since I use other cerave products. Im trying not to get mad over it but I am and wish I could return it by mail or get some sort of compensation",5,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,"I rarely write reviews, but I was in the search of an eye cream that was not too runny and this was the perfect one. It lays nicely under makeup which was one of my main concerns and also helped brightened my under eyes. I couldn't recommend more if you're looking for a thicker eye cream with an easy applicator!",2,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,Love this product,4,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,"Does nothing, does not target dark circles or wrinkles or anything. Equivlent to using their regular moisturizer but just under your eyes.",4,,
Eye Repair Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness for All Skin Types,This eye cream helps with my puffiness and moisturizes under my eye.,3,,

But, I'm not sure how other reviews are using this product but personally, I wash my face with the Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser, tone with the Hydrating CeraVe toner, apply this retinol on, and lastly, apply the La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+M Moisturizing Cream. The trick with retinol is that you have to wait out the purging and dryness period and pair this product with hydrating products, apply every third night or every other night, and APPLY SUNSCREEN in the day! Otherwise you will have issues with it like the other folks putting in bad reviews. Always do your research on how to pair it or put it on before diving in.",5,,

I use the CeraVe renewing night cream with this. I am very happy with this product.",4.4,,
CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser,"I've been using this cleanser for about 3 weeks and I have seen amazing results! My skin looks more clear and I have less pimples. I use this in the morning and night and pair it with the La-Roche Posay moistuizer, which works great for my dry skin! Although, I still have some breakouts because its hormonal, but at least when I wash my face I feel less bumps and feels smoother.",5,,
CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser,Works well with skin that's sensitive and dries out easily. This is gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin and clears up my acne. Works great for summer back acne as well. I get the 4% . 10% is too strong for my skin.,1,,
CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser,"After 3 months of use, I can conclude that this does not work. My derm prescribed me better topicals than this over the counter brand. I was looking for a cheaper alternative but my skin looks the same. Didnt fix any dark spots or wrinkles",4,,

CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser,"i absolutely LOVE this face wash! it was recommended to me by my dermatologist and it has done wonders for my skin. after only using it for a week, my skin has cleared up SO much!!! it also really clears up the little tiny acne bumpy things (if you know what im talking about) and really evens out my skin tone.",5,,
CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser,I'm not sure if this really helped my acne but it's a fine cleanser. It stained my towels though,5,,
CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser,This has helped with old and new scars and just overall skin texture. My skin is much smoother and it layers well under my night and day lotion.,4.4,,
CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser,"I started getting loads of hormonal acne last year going into my sophomore year, and hadn't found a product that actually helped my skin until i got this. I decided to use this product thanks to a girl online named aleyssa farrugia who also struggled with acne as well and recommended it, so I decided to give it a try, and im so thankful she put me onto this!! I've had less hormonal breakouts(I obviously still have breakout's but usually 1-2 pimples every few weeks to a month) and my skin has felt smoother with it. I have a relatively normal skin type so i have no problem using it twice a day but idk how it'll be for others. And it wasnt irritating at all until i recently decided to see a dermatologist and they also assigned me benzoyl peroxide gel, so i thought it using the face wash with the gel would make it, ' more effective' but it really just burned around my eyes and noseüò≠(but that was more on me and not on the wash, plus the gel itself was pretty irritating for me anyway). But disregarding that, its not irritating at all and i higly recommend it!!",5,,
CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser,"I bought this after going through a few weeks of really bad breakouts. It cleared my larger red pus-filled pimples, but because it isn't non-comedogenic I started to get closed comedones. It definitely hydrates so I'll probably use the rest if this bottle sparingly when I get dry skin. I think a product marketed as treating acne should be made to not clog pores from the start though.",1,,
CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser,I've been using it for two weeks but please don't be like me and not read the instructions. A little goes a long way with this product. I saw results within the first three days. I love it but double cleansing with another product or excessive cleansing (more than 3 minutes) can cause a little burning and drying. Gradually increase usage . Moisturizer is a must.,5,,

Alcohol-Free No Rinse Hydrating Facial Toner for Sensitive & Dry Skin,"this toner definitely lives up to its name, its very hydrating and probably a little to much for me because it made me look pretty oily throughout the day, however something that does not make me use it anymore is the fact that it broke me out pretty bad, in the span of one week using it i got 9 new pimples which is more than i usually get, personally this product is not for me",3,,

Alcohol-Free No Rinse Hydrating Facial Toner for Sensitive & Dry Skin,"This is the first step in my skin care routine. I think a toner is really important so that it restores the pH balance of your skin. A lot of ladies and men do not do the step but I think it's a very important one.

Alcohol-Free No Rinse Hydrating Facial Toner for Sensitive & Dry Skin,"The CeraVe Hydrating Toner is a reliable addition to my skincare routine. Its gentle formula effectively removes any remaining traces of dirt and impurities while maintaining the skin's natural moisture balance. I appreciate that it's fragrance-free and non-irritating, making it suitable for sensitive skin like mine. However, I've noticed that it doesn't offer the same level of exfoliation as some other toners on the market, so it might not be the best choice for those looking to target specific skin concerns like dullness or uneven texture. Overall, it's a solid option for everyday use, especially if you're seeking a gentle and hydrating toner for sensitive skin.",3,,
Alcohol-Free No Rinse Hydrating Facial Toner for Sensitive & Dry Skin,I really like this Cerave Hydrating Toner. It is gentle on your skin and leaves it feeling soft and smooth. It has a mild scent. I would recommend this product and will definitely buy it again. Ôøº,4.6,,
Alcohol-Free No Rinse Hydrating Facial Toner for Sensitive & Dry Skin,Love that there isn't any scent to this and the ingredients are clean. It feels like you're putting water on your face.

Alcohol-Free No Rinse Hydrating Facial Toner for Sensitive & Dry Skin,This is one of my favorite toners! ( the only toner I use right now) I love it! It's so hydrating but it only lasts me a couple of weeks. The price is super efficient and the packaging is easy to use. It has no smell to it which I love. The ingrediants seem fine. It overall is kind of mid. Like I would recommend but there are better options | I also think it's secretly breaking me out|,3,,
Alcohol-Free No Rinse Hydrating Facial Toner for Sensitive & Dry Skin,"I have used the 3rd bottle of toner from this brand, the product has a gentle, pleasant scent, dries quickly when applied to the skin, balances the PH level very well, I like to use it after washing my face, it absorbs very quickly and my skin Looks firmer, simple design, easy to use and maintain, and the price is also cheap compared to the market",5,,
Alcohol-Free No Rinse Hydrating Facial Toner for Sensitive & Dry Skin,"I have repurchased this toner several times and will continue to do so.

No matter what combination of serums and moisturizers I used, I couldn't quite repair my barrier. Just the simple addition of using this toner immediately after washing and before any other product, gave my skin that extra protection and boost of hydration. It made a world of difference... please never discontinue or change this toner! It's perfection!!",5,,
Alcohol-Free No Rinse Hydrating Facial Toner for Sensitive & Dry Skin,"As someone with oily skin, this toner has helped me acheive the dewy/glass skin look. It hydrates intensely which helps blunt my face's usual inclination to produce way too much oil.

Alcohol-Free No Rinse Hydrating Facial Toner for Sensitive & Dry Skin,Had a facial and the esthetician advised using a toner as part of my routine. Saw the Cerave and gave it a try.

CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"I've used the ""hydrating"" cloths in the past and there was something just not the same as the original ones. After I looked At the ingredient label the 3rd ingredient is isopropyl! In the original wipes, the ingredient Cetearyl Alcohol , is listed as the 15th ingredient! No wonder the ""hydrating"" is terrible! I'm guessing the new product was developed because it's biodegradable. Which I'm all for, just not at the expense of my skin. And now I can't even find the original ones, if I do they are being sold from a 3rd party way over cost! Please bring them back, I love your products! Just not the hydrating makeup removing cloths.",1,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,Too hydrating for oily skin. Makes my face breakout. Where can I purchase the regular ones?,4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"I bought this pack a day or two ago and I didn't notice a bad smell at all. Mine was very lightly scented. However, I didnt like them for other reasons. The wipe itself is like a thin smooth cloth, but because of that it didn't do well at removing makeup. I use minimal products so I was disappointed that it could barely remove that. They also felt slightly dry. Not really worth it in mt opinion because there are better options that are cheaper",4,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"This is not what you were expecting. I was looking for a men's body wipe that would moisturize and protect after a gym workout shower. This product, in men's skincare products. Yes, there are all sorts of no-shower cleaning wipes (man-sized, man-scents, etc.) but no post-shower moisturizing wipes. yes, all sorts of post-shower LOTIONS, but no wipes. Of course, most women have no problem with a lotion, they'll spend quite some time putting it on. Men do not have that kind of patience. I wanted a wipe that I could wipe on and be done with it. Well, this is it. The CereVe wipes are large enough to be workable (wish they were larger) and the neutral scent is just fine--in fact, after you wipe it on there is no scent that I can tell, but most importantly, the moisturizing properties are through the roof! So L'Or√©al,, how about you increase the size of these wipes, add a little woodsy scent and put it in a travel pak that I can toss in my gym bag?",3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,These wipes are really soft on the skin and work well at removing makeup but they have an awful smell! They smell like cow manure and it lingers on the skin afterwards. I thought I had a bad batch but looking at other reviews it seems that they might have changed the formula.,1,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"These wipes smell like manure. They smell like cow poop on a farm. Which is unfortunate because they feel nice and soft on the skin and do a good job at removing makeup. I just can't get passed the smell, it even lingers on your skin.",1,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"I have used serveral Cerave products before and for a long time but as I've recently started to wear makeup, I have been using the Neutrogena brand wipes but I figured for as much as I love the cerave brand, why not try the makeup removing/hydrating wipes but as I opened the package and used the first wipe, it has a weird/awful smell! Mine almost smell like manure?? I have NOT had this issues with any other product which is why I am surprised. If you can get past the smell, the product is really nice. It removes more makeup than anything else I've used and feels really soft on my skin without leaving a residue on my face. Over all, the product is nice just the smell is a big turn off.",4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,Smells awful and I'm not sure why I have to use a certain number of characters since smells awful sums it up.,4,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,I decided to try these because I like CeraVe moisturizer and thought they would be a good change from my previous make up remover wipes. They were pretty expensive but I still tried them. They were so dried out that they were not very effective and after a few days I switched back to my old brand.,3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"I was reading other reviews and was surprised about the smell issue - the smell of these doesn't bother me at all, and I definitely don't get a fishy smell. Maybe its like cilantro ‚Ä¶ only some people are affected? Anyway, I like the wipes. They do a great job removing makeup (including waterproof mascara) without drying my skin. I like to take them camping and traveling as they're very convenient. Wish the packaging was a little better as the opener doesn't restick well, but it's definitely not a deal breaker.",3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,The three stars has nothing to do with quality of the wipes but the how the packaging was changed in retrieving a wipe and dryness from a think layer of plastic seal. I purchased the Hydrating Makeup Removing Plant-Based Wipes when CeraVe first released them and wished they didn't change how to retrieve. Please considered a recycle hard shell cover that locks in the moisture for longevity.,1,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"This is my second time trying to leave a review. I received notification that my original review ""did not meet all our website guidelines."" I absolutely love the other CeraVe skincare products I use, but these wipes smell awful!!! It is exactly as everyone described--fishy! This problem has been documented for months; how are these wipes still being made and sold in this condition? Please do better, CeraVe!",4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"HATE THE SMELL! I believe in the CeraVe product line, however, there needs to be a serious revamping of the scent of these wipes!!! THEY SMELL AWFUL. I used them 2 nights in a row, and don't think I can take another try, so the whole package will be thrown away.",4,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"I think this is a great product. I use it to remove my makeup, then wash with a cleanser. This way I'm sure to get it all of",3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,They takeoff the make up but they smell disgusting like nasty fish. I am going to try to return them to the store. I will stick with the wash in the bottle.,1,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,I like how they work but they smell like fish. Please explain.,1,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,I used to love these wipes but the past couple packages I bought have a strong fishy smell. Looks like other customers have reported similar.,4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,These wipes smell absolutely disgusting. They smell like fish and leave a sticky feeling on my face. Will be returning them.,4,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,These were my favorite facial wipe cleansers for the last few years but they now have a terrible fish odor. I have recently purchased 3 different packages and they all smell the same. I will not be buying again.,3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,I bought these because I love the cleanser but these smell like fish. It's horrible! Can NOT stand the smell. What a waste!,3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"CeraVe products are my go to so on the rare occasion that I decide to use make up wipes, I wanted to try these. However, I'm very disappointed in the SMELL. Every time I use them, I want to gag at the fishy stench. At first I thought they may just smell like this because they're ""plant based"" but now I'm wondering if there was something wrong with them. Would like to purchase CeraVe make up wipes again but probably won't until a new version or type is made.",1,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"These wipes are HUGE! I love it though because I was able to remove all my makeup with one wipes. My eyes did not burn and my mascara easily came off without me having to tug on my lashes. I was doubtful, but these are the real deal!",4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,Threw two new packages in the trash because of the latest fishy smell. Will not purchase again.,4,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,I use this product because I am allergic to benzyl alcohol and it is one of the only ones that works for me. I am now being forced to find a different product because I literally camt get past the smell.,3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"the product itself does the job, super hydrating, takes off my makeup well, it's nice. however, the packaging is kinda annoying. i've bought this product 3 times now and each time the plastic flap that opens and closes just falls off, the first time i thought i yaked it too hard but the second two times i was more gentle it still happened, causing the wipes to dry out and not be as effective.",5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,Totally agree with other comments. I've bought these a ton of times but this newest pack smells TERRIBLE like fish!! My daughter and I thought we were going crazy!!,1,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"I use many other Cerave products which I love. So when I learned they made wipes I was so excited to try. But the smell is horrific to the point I can't use them. The smell like fish! Upon reading reviews here and on other sites, this seems to be mentioned frequently in recent reviews. I'm concerned there may be something wrong/contaminated in a recent batch. I can not imagine anyone willingly rubbing these cloths on their face. I'm hope Cereve investigates because as I said, I use and love many of their other products.",4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,They feel great on the face and remove mascara,4,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,Keeps burning my face. I'm not sure what it is but I don't know if it's the product or something im using with it. It hurts tho,3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,I previously reviewed the cervae wipes thinking I was leaving a review about the Hydrating Makeup Removing Plant Based Wipes. So here we go again. These wipes used to be a 5 star for me but the last few packs I've been buying gives off this fishy smell that's very prudent.,1,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"I have bought Cerave facial wipes for years, but the new formula has a terrible smell! I thought maybe the top few wipes were affected, but it's the whole package. I'm returning them! They actually smell like unfresh fish Such a shame for a previously great product!",5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,I wanted to love these wipes so bad but when I opened up the pack I almost thought I had a bad batch after smelling them‚Ä¶ it wreaks like moldy fish!! I never write reviews good or bad but this was just disgusting. I tried one and loved how it worked but could not get past the smell. Will be returning.,4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,The smell is absolutely disgusting. I had high hopes for these. Very disappointing.,4,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,I have been using Cerave makeup removing wipes for years and I love them. They work very well at removing tough makeup. I recently purchased the hydrating Plant based wipes by mistake and the problem I have with them is the terrible smell. I purchased two packages from different sources and I just can't get past the unpleasant odor so I will be going back to the original. Hope Cerave does something about this.,3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,I really enjoy these facial wipes they are very gentle and soft and wipe away even my waterproof mascara . I have sensitive skin and this didn't bother me . I feel hydrated but not greasy like others do to me . I wish the wipes were a bit more moist but I rather that then use wipes with lots of chemicals,2,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"Buyer Beware! This product caused a severe redness, swelling and skin peeling beginning 1 1/2 hours after removal of my makeup over my entire face and eyelids. Notified CereVe customer care by phone and online. Suggested product recall and cautionary public notification. Returned to store where purchased for refund.",1,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,"I really liked these, I get all my make up off with one wipe ( inly do my eyes) and it doesn't felt harsh on my skin and I also love their compostable",4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Wipes,These worked wonders for me .Cleared all my peeling dry skin and large red spots all over my face that I had for nearly two years. Noticed a big difference in just 5 days. I use 2 a day ...everyday.,4,,

CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"I'm sure some would argue with me about this product not being for those with truly dry skin. And that's fine. Everyone is different and entitled to their opinion. I'm simply expressing mine, in the hope that it may help someone who needs more moisture than this can provide. The upsides of this product? Contains ceramides. Has a functioning pump, making application quick and easy while keeping the product free from contamination. It also absorbs quickly and won't leave you greasy, sticky or shiny thus allowing you to get dressed immediately after application. The downside? It simply doesn't contain the oils and occlusives that truly dry skin needs. No matter how many times you might reapply, it isn't going to do what a more emollient cream does. This isn't a CeraVe hate review. I have purchased this cream many times and some of their other products are among my favorites.

CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,Formula has changed. this product does nothing to my skin. stop wasting people money on something that doesn't work,5,,
CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"I've been using CeraVe for Lichen Sclerosis. Which is a very painful disease with ulcers, for 10 years, I noticed the areas of my skin have slowly gotten worse. I use your moisturizer all day long every day. Then I realized your cream was thinner. People are using this for serious skin disorders. You think you can just change formulations and no one is going to notice. Americans are noticing. Boeing didn't think anyone would notice either. My Dermatologist at Vanderbilt told me to change to Eucerin. I've been in severe pain for 6 months because it took that long for me to catch on. I will never buy your products again. I used to buy your product every month for 10 years. Shape up, you're messing with peoples health",1,,
CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"I wanted this product to be a holy grail moisturizer but both my skin and my husband's skin do not seem to care much for Cervae. On my skin which is oily, the product would just sit on top and seemed to hydrate the very top layer of my skin. For my husband who has KP bumps and significantly drier skin, the product would be absorbed within a couple hours and there was little to no textural difference in his skin even with reapplication. Overall this products works for other people, just not for me.",5,,

I love that, every night when i put lotion on him, i can feel confident knowing that its a good, quality product that i can use on myself. Its a win/win!",5,,
CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"I live in a desert environment and work a job that requires me to wash my hands often- which means my hands are insanely dry and the knuckes often crack painfully. I haven't been using this product for long, but it's amazing. Hydrating, comfortable, but not greasy like most products similar to this does. Definitely worth it- especially for the amount of product you get for the cost",5,,
CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,Best lotion ever! Hydrates and protects and dormant skin.,4.7,,
CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"I use this at night and it is a good staple product. It never burns my skin or causes any irritation. It is thicker than regular moisturizer, but it soaks into the skin well.",5,,
CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,I'm not sure what ingredient in this doesn't agree with my face. (I have very dry sensitive skin). I break out so bad with it any time I use it. It doesn't sink into my skin. It feels like it sits on top of the skin which is weird cause I've never had this problem. I wish I could like it but it's not for me,1,,
CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"I bought this to compare it to gold bond, so I use it as a body lotion. It works well, not greasy. The only downside is I didn't realize this brand is not cruelty free, which really bothers me üòî",5,,
CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"Prior to previous cerave formulas I have tried, this is much more mousturizing, with a breathable feeling. I have combination, acne prone skin and since using this product, I have not experienced a breakout. My complexion has never been more clear. The only downside, is a slightly greasy feeling but it isn't too bad. Price point is affordable, and I would recommend this as a daily moisturizer",4.7,,
CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"This is better than their original lotion. For context, I have used CeraVe products since I was 15 years old and diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis on my hands (I'm in my mid-30s now). I still have the occasional minor flare-ups, but it's nowhere near as bad as it was when I was in high school (we're talking all over redness, extremely itchy bumps, dry/cracked skin, and significant bleeding). What I do deal with now is a damaged skin barrier on my hands from years of topical steroid use; I was diagnosed and treated before dermatologists knew topical steroids could be bad for you long-term. As a result, my hands are constantly dry and I am forever reapplying lotion to them, so I am always interested in moisturizers that are long-lasting. When I saw this new version of CeraVe lotion, I decided to give it a try. So far, so good! It lasts through a couple of hand washes, my hands feel much softer, and are retaining moisture better. This product lives up to the claims of not being sticky or greasy, which is great for someone like me who had to endure years of thick, greasy, occlusive creams and topicals. I will say it does take a minute to fully rub it into your skin - it doesn't dry quickly like Hempz brand lotion does, but to be fair, it provides way more moisture and lasts much longer between applications. The only downside is, if you have any open cuts or particularly dry patches from eczema or other skin conditions, it may cause a very slight stinging/itching, but it's tolerable and immediately goes away once the lotion is absorbed. I did deduct one star for this reason, because other lotions and creams have eliminated the ingredients that cause this, and it may be a deal-breaker for some people. Overall, I would recommend it and will likely repurchase until I find something better!",5,,
CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,Compared to the original hydrating lotion this gives longer lasting results. It feels like it sinks so mych deeper into my skin and even if I don't reapply after a shower my skin is still noticably more hydrated with no product on it. It also isnt greasy or almost sticky feeling like a lot of itch relief or deep hydrating lotions are. I'd recommend this over the original daily lotion formula especially for the itchy dry skin girlies in the winter,4,,

It also absorbs quickly and won't leave you greasy, sticky or shiny thus allowing you to get dressed immediately after application. The downside? It simply doesn't contain the oils and occlusives that truly dry skin needs. No matter how many times you might reapply, it isn't going to do what a more emollient cream does. This isn't a CeraVe hate review. I have purchased this cream many times and some of their other products are among my favorites. And I'm looking forward to trying their new lotion that contains ""5% Hydro-Urea"" which could be a wonderful addition to their (and my) lineup. I hope this helps!",4.7,,

CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"I always bought this product and loved it but always noticed it was super thick and didnt absorb the way I liked it to.

I chose a different brand and over time the small bumps disappeared.",4.7,,

CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"I've tried so many high end Korean moisturizers with fancy ingredients and this is the only one that reliably tames the flakiness around my mouth and chin from my tret regimen. A tub lasts forever too, even when used generously on hands and the rest of the body. At under $2/oz it's definitely one of the most cost effective moisturizers out there.",5,,

CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"I've been using CeraVe for Lichen Sclerosis. Which is a very painful disease with ulcers, for 10 years, I noticed the areas of my skin have slowly gotten worse. I use your moisturizer all day long every day. Then I realized your cream was thinner. People are using this for serious skin disorders. You think you can just change formulations and no one is going to notice. Americans are noticing. Boeing didn't think anyone would notice either. My Dermatologist at Vanderbilt told me to change to Eucerin. I've been in severe pain for 6 months because it took that long for me to catch on. I will never buy your products again. I used to buy your product every month for 10 years. Shape up, you're messing with peoples health",1,,
CeraVe Moisturizing Cream,"I wanted this product to be a holy grail moisturizer but both my skin and my husband's skin do not seem to care much for Cervae. On my skin which is oily, the product would just sit on top and seemed to hydrate the very top layer of my skin. For my husband who has KP bumps and significantly drier skin, the product would be absorbed within a couple hours and there was little to no textural difference in his skin even with reapplication. Overall this products works for other people, just not for me.",5,,

CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30,"I wanted to love this for the price but I can't stand it. It smells TERRIBLE, every time I wear it it's all I can smell. It haunts me all day. It's also impossible to get off for a sunscreen, requires makeup remover/wipe. You'll also be so greasy.",3.9,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30,It has just enough tint to give you a little color so if you don't want to wear makeup you do not need to.,4,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30,This stuff DOES NOT wash off. It requires make up remover. Would NOT buy again.,1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30,I was hsing a very pricey primer and found this. I was pleasantly surprised and get compliments on my skin when I wear it. I also combine it with l'oreal's lumi glowtion and it's gorgeous!!,2,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30,"I use a Cetaphil face wash, Cetaphil sunscreen & CeraVe moisturizer that have all been my fave together. I had no idea this product existed and couldn't wait to love it. I'm not sure why ""non-greasy"" and ""non-comedigenic"" are even listed as details because it was the complete opposite. I even made sure to shake the bottle before applying so all ingredients mixed properly. I wore this indoors and looked sweaty all day. I should have removed it sooner because I just knew and felt it would cause a reaction. Sure enough, after showering and getting ready for bed, I had already noticed red bumps/breakouts on my face. I was lucky to match with the shade of tint, and aside from the cons, it was perfect coverage for me. The color blended so well with me. I wouldn't recommend this for someone who has sensitive skin and I'd also hate for anyone to struggle with the only color they have available.",5,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30,"After developing an allergy to a tinted sunscreen that I had used for many years, I was on the hunt for a suitable replacement. I am so happy with this product! I have fair, combination, sensitive skin. This does not irritate my skin and it blends in well with no white or orange cast.",3.9,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30,"I wanted so badly to love this product because its actually an affordable tinted sunscreen, but it is so bad! It says it is a non-greasy formula‚Ä¶ but that couldn't be farther from the truth. This is the most greasy sunscreen i have ever used. It can't be worn with any makeup because it causes the makeup to break up within 30 minutes of applying. You also cant wear mascara with this because the greasiness of the product will cause the mascara to transfer to your lid‚Ä¶ even if its waterproof! It also oxidizes a LOT so keep that in mind. I definitely wont purchase ever again and wouldn't recommend to any skin types.",4,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30,"It feels like I'm putting on foundation and sometimes dries orange. It comes off so easily when sweating even after giving it time to soak in. Im pretty sure it also started to break me out too. Also with such a wide known brand, why not many different tints? Overall, could be better in all aspects.",1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30,I am 60something and tend to have dry skin. when I found this moisturizing sunscreen I was excited. what I didn't know is that it turned into a makeup primer on my face! Worked beautifully under my CC cream and then set it with a mineral powder,5,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30,"I can't say with absolute certainty that this product broke me out, but I can say I tried it for six days and broke out in spots I don't usually break out. I checked the ingredients on an online ""pore-clogging ingredient checker"" and found that this product DOES have pore-clogging ingredients. Although correlation doesn't equal causation - this product feels a little thick, making it a little hard to blend. It also feels oily/greasy on my face. It was a relief to see that it does have pore-clogging ingredients because that meant I could throw it away and feel a little less guilty about it. It's a shame because I love Cerave's AM lotion with sunscreen, and this product is budget friendly. If you have extra cash, try this product out. It might be for you, it just wasn't for me. On to the next!",1,,

CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30,"I've been looking for a budget friendly, mineral sunscreen to wear everyday and so glad I found this! No pilling, no white cast (I have brown Indian skin tone), and doesn't flare up my acne prone skin. Only downside is spf 30 is low coversge if I am out in the sun all day‚Ä¶ but thats what chemical sunscreens are for i guess",5,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30,I truly love this just would like to find it in a SPF 60. It's my daily and don't have to wear foundation. I top it with loose powder just because I probably over apply and I feel it doesn't absorb completely.,2,,

I have very dry skin so I start with E.L.F fragrance free hydrating face cream, then follow with E.L.F hydrating primer serum.

Please never discontinue this product. Sincerely, A Cerave lover.",5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"Yes, it definitely feels greasy. I used the smallest little blob on my hands to see how it felt. Definitely helped with my dry skin, but it was a bit too much for me as my skin isn't THAT dry. However, I bought this for my husband who has extremely dry, cracked skin. He used it before bed and, though he didn't like it's greasy feel, he noticed that his hands felt loads better the next morning and the greasy feeling was gone. So, best if your skin is VERY dry and cracked, not just a little dry.",4,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"This ointment has all but fixed my dry skin. I live in a dry state that can leave your skin feeling like a cement sidewalk. I use this every single night and no longer have any dry patches, flaking, redness, NOTHING! It has been a game changer",4.5,,

CeraVe Healing Ointment,Not a exciting product but it does the job + is good to keep in your first aid/sick kit. I have used it to hydrate a very flakey and dry nose after being sick and it soothed and hydrated the area. It absolutely is greasy when first applied but that is what you need for dry skin that cant be exfoliated away. Also great for chapped lips and hands in the winter,1,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,It does have a greasy feel but it works! I have eczema on my cheaks that left them with a dry flaky texture. My skin feels much more smooth now.,5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"This product is amazing, I noticed a huge difference in my skin after about two weeks of using CeraVe products. I'm 43 years old with combination acne prone skin. This product helped my acne and gave my skin a very moisturized and smooth appearance, just wish there was a way to use all of the product in the tube. There is no way to take the lid off to use all of the serum and it is kind of pricy.",5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,Have a bunch of sample sizes and I like it a lot but the after affects are a little greasy for me. It works fantastic if you aren't touching something immediately after. The packaging is a cute tub and the one I have is tiny and cute. The scent is like petroleum jelly.,4.5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,It feels like engine grease and does nothing to help cracked and chafed skin. It feels greasy and gross when applied. The price point is an insult for a bad product.,5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"This is my 1st time purchasing this & so far I love it. I've been using this for a week & can already see & feel the difference in my skin. I have dry sensitive skin & this ointment gets the job done without being overly greasy, so glad I got this!",1,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,This product works very well I just don't really like how it feels on my face. It's thick like a paste and makes my skin vaseliney. It doesn't smell like anything. But my face feels hydrated.,5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"The ointment is thick in texture so you really have to squish the packaging to get some out, so I wouldn't recommend the tube version if you have arthritis in your hands. It doesn't leave a stickiness to the touch afterwards if you don't use a lot of it and it's also odorless. I've been trying it every night for 1 month and it's not particularly great in any way, i'll probably buy a cheaper ointment after this runs out.",1,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"If you work in healthcare/food prep anything where you constantly wash your hands - this is a no brainer! My hands feel so much relief! I keep it at home, work, and in my purse.",4.5,,

CeraVe Healing Ointment,It's great for the winter time. Normally my skin is pretty dry in the winter time and I apply this and it really helps it also very good for the lips and you mix it up with some Vaseline and it will really help your lips. Definitely recommend.,1,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"A real game changer. My lips were cracked and peeling. I tried everything, to no avail. I read an online recommendation from a dermatologist that suggested Cerave Healing Ointment. I saw immediate improvement. I highly recommend.",5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,Have been loving the product once i can finally squeez it out of the tube. So difficult it hurts my hands. Would give 5 stars otherwise. Has all but cured my dry heels,5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"I have had eczema on my ears for 70 years, tried many creams and steroids. Using this cured permanently in two days. I use it around my eyes, very thin layer, and on my lips. I use it on my toes and nails, they stay soft and cured a bit of athletes foot under my little toe. Crusty spots on my scalp also cured, and any irritation on my behind heals fast. Oh and I burned myself on the oven, it is doing a great job fading the scar, I massage it. Last, I appreciate that it has ZERO scent or odor. Very reasonable price, my jar has lasted all winter.",4.5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,I am loving this product so much! I've been using it for a month now and it's made a huge difference on my skin. My skin is sensitive and tends to dry and this has moisturized my skin and helped with breakouts! I love it,5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"I have this in the tubs and in tubes all over my house. I use it on top of moisturizer out of the shower‚Ä¶ I use it when my skin is raw or irritated‚Ä¶ I use it on my lips, my face. This is seriously an all in one product. This is so moisturizing and and truly is healing. This was recommended after a skin biopsy to help my skin heal and I do not have a scar where my dermatologist had me put it every day. This was recommended by my dermatologist and I'm so glad I bought it.",1,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,Best ointment ever! Great replacement for Vaseline! The consistency is amazing and it leaves my dry skin feeling great! Amazing for the cost too,5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,This product is a game changer and completely affordable. It's good for hydration and healing any acne scars.,5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,I've come out in the most awful hives and blistering rash on my neck and face after using this product.,4.5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,Sometimes I like this better than Vaseline. It works so well and it's effective. It doesn't have a greasy jelly like texture and has no smell. There's a lot of product in just one small container.,5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,Great product. Have to my daughter cause she has acne‚Ä¶ worked well on her and myself.. definitely worth buying!!,1,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,This is my absolute favorite ointment for my son's rash! He also likes to scratch himself and they heal pretty good. It's gentle on him it's non greasy and effective! No scent It works great on him I will continue to buy this,1,,

So she gave me some samples it worked great for me my feet r no longercracking my arm are no longer that dry my back doesn't itch anymore I love the ointment CeraVe but again I can't afford but hoping my Dr will give me more samples so my skin can continue to feel better,1,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,I bought this one since my usual La Roche Posay Hyalu B5 serum was out of stock. What a pleasant surprise much better packaging than LRP(love the pump) price was 1/2 the price of LRP & can be used under makeup versus the oily texture of LRP. I am now going to try your other products.,5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"This is the worst skin product I have ever used. And I feel very disappointed because I usually love CeraVe products. I've been using the foam cleanser for years. But this stuff gave me the worst acne of my life. It seems like every ingredient is designed to clog your pores. I am not the type of person that is prone to acne breakouts or pimples. But the day after using this stuff for the first time, every single pore in my forehead was clogged with whiteheads. It's an extremely GREASY formula. You may as well slather Crisco all over your face!",1,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"Having used CeraVe products before, I really wanted to like this. Was looking for a hyaluronic serum this was the most reasonably priced. It's IS a creamy texture. Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. However, It's listed as non comedogenic sadly after a week of use I had breakouts. Tiny bumps all over. I have also used CeraVe night cream (that also contains hyaluronic acid) and did not have this effect.",4.5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,I love this product. I can tell a difference in my skin when I don't use it. It absorbs easily into my skin.,5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"I am over 50 and I prefer this healing ointment for nighttime ""slugging"" over Vaseline. I will also use it on my hands over my lotion because it does not leave my skin feeling greasy.",1,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,I received this as a free gift from my recent order. I was starting to have an eczema out break on my eye lids and corner of my eyes. 1 time using it and it's cleared up. No redness no dry flakey spots. I'm impressed beyond belief. I used it on other areas I was at war with eczema and it helped! I have prescription cream but when my eyes break out it dries it more and just gets gross. It makes me very self conscious. I'm happy this works.,3,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"I haven't noticed any real differences with my skin. However, my skin is very sensitive and this product didn't make me break out or cause any rashes, so I'll keep using it.",5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,I came across this product through an Instagram ad and figured it was worth using on my very dry skin. I first tried it on my lips but that didn't work as well. I then started using it on my legs after shaving and it worked fabulously. It moisturizing while also soothing any razor burn that I get. I also love this for my hands if they get a bit dry in the colder months. This is also great to help with any cuts.,4.5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"This scent-free ointment is nice and thick, but in terms of effectiveness it's just okay. I generally really like CeraVe products, but this healing ointment isn't very long lasting and doesn't give me great results. I had expectations that it would heal, hydrate, and make my skin soft, but honestly, I see no difference.",5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"I put this ointment all over my hands, then wear cotton gloves to sleep. When I wake up, my hands feel great! It's great for revitalizing dry, chapped, hard-working hands overnight.",1,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"This is probably my absolute favorite product in my house. We put it on chapped lips, burns, scratches, and my 17-year-old even uses it in her skincare routine. It is one of the most versatile products and this one container has lasted about a year. It's hands-down the most effective products that my kids will actually let me use on them without a fight.",5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"This is my third tube and I really cannot get enough. I tried the jar but I prefer being able to squeeze it out of a tube as I find it more hygienic and efficient. I put this literally everywhere; on my lips, cracked elbows and heels. I use it underneath my eyes at night as a ""seal"" for my skincare. Although it might not be super different from Vaseline, I find myself reaching for this every night as opposed to other petroleum products.",3,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,Amazing! Non-greasy and very hydrating and nourishing on my skin! Definitely a staple for everyday dryness for my skin!!,4.5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"I would apply this after my chemical peel. It says non greasy but it did feel greasy to me. However, still worked great for my face after my peel.",5,,
CeraVe Healing Ointment,"I've been using this product for a month now and my skin has really been improving. I slug my face with it every night before bed and I've saw the effectiveness. The texture puts me in the mind of ""milk hydro grip"" which is a nice sensation in my opinion. The scent isn't strong at all. For the money you are paying it's worth it if you want clear skin. In the video provided is my skin recently. I recommend this product for anyone looking to make a difference within their skin routine.",1,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I have used this for almost a year now and my skin loves it! My skin is very dry and sensitive, so I can only use certain products. This is an awesome product, it helps with dryness and is not heavy or greasy. Your skin can still breathe after using this, it's so light and refreshing.",4.7,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"this might be my favorite cerave moisturizer. i first tried it in May this year alongside another new product Vanicream Vitamin C. all summer this was my favorite combo. vanicream vitamin c + cerave gel moisturizer + hero cosmetics force shield spf. it made my sensitive, skin happy all summer. I'm going to keep it going the rest of the year.",5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"Great, light weight moisturizer for summer months. Non greasy, and absorbs quickly. No residue on my hands. My face feels hydrated and soft all day long. Would highly recommend and I plan to re-purchase for next summer! (I need something heavier for winter months as I have very dry skin).",3,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I enjoy this product - I feel like it does moisturize my face, and I love how it makes my skin feel. However, I feel like it could be just a little better. I find I need to use more than one pump, and I don't understand why I should need to use that much moisturizer. It does work, though. I'm curious to see how long the tube lasts!",5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,Evryone seems to like this but i really dont it burns when i put it on and i feel like it may be worsening my acne im going to try the cera ve pm moisturizer and am one and hopefully those r better,5,,

CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I hate feeling greasy. This moisturizer really penetrates my skin and leaves it feeling soft and good!! I cannot stress this enough, I have tried soo many moisturizers and I really like this one a lot.",4.7,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,moisturizing but doesn't sit well under sunscreen or foundation...pills up.,5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,I bought this because of all the positive reviews but man I am disappointed‚Ä¶ I liked the feeling of the product itself but it did not moisturize my skin and burned when applying it. It also pills WITH other cerave products which shocked me.,3,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,I have tried so many face moisturizers and they are always heavy feeling on my face and i live in Florida and i usually feel a layer of sweat beads. This moisturizer doesnt feel like that and my face feels soft! This is my new favorite moisturizer for sure!,5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I bought this and a la roche posay one- this one wins! It doesnt pill under makeup, its lightweight, and doesnt smell at all. I dont think its oil free based on the packaging, but it doesnt feel oily. I switched from the cream tub for the winter weather and to this for summer with the humidity and oiliness. I like the lid as well as it stands up in my medicine cabindt",4,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I love the gel moisturizer. It feels nice putting it on. The only thing I don't like is the pump. I have to pump the tube about 25 times before I can get any product out, and you're not able to bypass the pump by twisting the top off. Please fix the pump issue.",4.7,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I really liked this cream, I can put it on par with the cream from Obagi. Nourishes the skin, but does not leave a greasy layer. The skin becomes very soft after using the cream. The gel texture does not create the feeling of a greasy mask on the face. Based on the advice of my cosmetologist, I took it for myself, so I can say for sure that the cream does not clog pores and will not cause rashes",5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,I absolutely love this product! However the packaging is terrible! You never get all of the product you pay for. I cut it open just to see how much was left & why it wouldn't dispense; there is approx 2 more weeks worth. Please change the packaging so the consumer gets what we're paying for.,3,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I have very oily skin, especially in my T zone. I love this. Ive been using it for about 1 year now currently on my second bottle. Its very light and doesnt leave my skin feeling full of oil throughout the day.",5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,It is so hard deciding if this product is my favorite or the night cream. They are both so prefect in their own way. I use this one in the morning and the night cream at night. It moisturizes and even helps my primer seal and blur my face some. Dries quickly so I'm not waiting forever to put on my primer and then wait for that to finally put on my makeup. Cerave knocked this one out of the park!!!,5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"This face moisturizer is perfect for the comming summer ! Living in Florida is living always in summer and this moisturizer is fantastic! The texture is gel, transparent and easy to apply, it's like adding aloe. This one reminds me of the Kate Somerville face cream but less expensive. So, a good option that hydrates pretty good during al day and leaving a beautiful ending .",4.7,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,I have been usiing this for about 6 months now love it I use it in thr morning and at night Before going to bed,5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,Sample size moisturizing gel from @cerave. It was okay for my skin but certain areas just get reallllly dry so I might need something stronger than this. Or I might need to add another..something to it ..idk yet.,3,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,This is a simple/basic lightweight moisturizer. It's a gel texture so I mainly use it as part of my morning skincare routine. It's fragrance free and works for my sensitive skin.,5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,I absolutely love this moisturizer for my oily skin. Doesn't make my skin oily nor heavy feeling. It absorbs into my skin nicely and it's also easy to use. Definitely Recommend,5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,This sample I received of this ultra light gel cream is really a bummer. I found that it absolutely did not smooth my skin. It was lightweight but the moisture in my skin only seemed to last a few hours. I really was not impressed with it at all it has no scent so that is pretty much it. I guess if you want a super lightweight moisturizer that would be great if you just want a few hours of hydration.,4.7,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,This stuff is magic! Super lightweight and fast absorption. It really doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything on my face but I'm deeply hydrated.,5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I prefer gel moisturizers so I bought this hoping to have an affordable replacement for a pricey gel moisturizer that I've been using for years. I use a lot of other CeraVe products and love them so I had high hopes for this. However, as someone with dry and sensitive skin, this product did not work for me. Shortly after applying, my skin already felt like it was just as dry as before and hadn't been moisturized. After about the first day I also started noticing a splotchy red rash, red bumps, acne, and whiteheads in the areas where I'd applied the moisturizer. After doing some research on the ingredients and comparing it with other CeraVe products I use that don't cause a reaction, I feel fairly confident that my reaction is a result of the use of one or both of these ingredients, propanediol and chlorphenesin.",3,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,I've been using this moisturizer daily for months now. It doesn't leave residue or a sticky feeling on my skin. The packaging is also great. We've all had to cut the ends off of our products in tubes to get out every last bit. That is NOT the case with this one. Mine is VERY near empty and the product is still coming out with the pump!,3,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I was gifted by CeraVe this sample of Ultra Light Moisturising Gel for my honest opinion. I actually love this. This gel is so lightweight and absorbed very quickly. I used it on my off day. Once in the AM and PM. I also did not use any other products with this. My skin felt very moisturized and clean! Very Clean! Zero residue and I had no reactions from this what so ever. I will definitely be buying a full size of this. This has such a very clean feeling on my face. CeraVe is a common product, but I will definitely look at the big box stores for the whole line.",5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,I have spent soooo much money on a moisturizer for my oily skin. I tried this product and I am hooked!! it's soooo good!!! I highly recommend!!!,4.7,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I usually love gel moisturizers for my sensitive and acne prone combo skin but unfortunately this one left me disappointed. The consistency was nice immediately upon application, but within minutes my face felt super dry as if I hadn't applied a moisturizer at all. It certainly does ""absorb quickly"" as it promises. However I'd expect my skin to be left at least a little hydrated after absorption. I'll give it a star for being non irritating at least, because even the OG Cerave cream burns my face sometimes and this product did not. I'll probably just end up giving this to my husband who has a much oilier skin type, hopefully it will work better for him than it did for me.",5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"Really nice, lightweight moisturizer. I was looking for a replacement for another product that seems to have been discontinued and this is the closest I could find. Overall it's a very light and wears well under makeup. A great day time moisturizer. In the evening I layer with Cerave moisturizer cream for an added boost. I have repurchased and will continue to.",3,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,I am allergic to everyhing and have cystic hormonal acne with dry skin. I have been using this for about a month and have seen huge improvement.,5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,If I could recommend one moisturizer for oily skin it'd be this one this is my second one I'm buying I love it so much I have not broken out any more since I started using it I use it with the cera ve foaming cleanser and it's the perfect combo,2,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,I love this moisturizer. It's so lightweight and makes my skin so soft. Does everything it promises to do without the huge price tag.,4.7,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"Really helped to hydrate my skin, especially paired with the hydrating facial cleanser. Super light weight and absorbs super fast",5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I really like how this sinks into my skin and leaves it nice and soft after it dries. Further, I have noticed a change in some scarring and dark markings the more I use this moisturizer. In all, I highly recommend this product by CeraVe. I wish they do not discontinue this.",3,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,I used to really dislike to wear cream and then put make up on but this one is perfect for it doenst make my skin oily at all and my make up looks good,5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,I started using this moisturizing gel daily in the morning after taking the quiz on the CeraVe website. It isn't heavily scented and it can be worn alone when I'm just hanging around inside.,4,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I have dry, sensitive, mature skin. I have been experiencing dehydration, redness and reactions to other skincare care / make-up over the last year. I decided to try the CeraVe Ultra Light Gel, using it am and pm and even per my esthetician my skin has more hydration, my redness is dramatically reduced and well as my overall irritation/inflammation that was previously present. With its light texture it immediately absorbs into the skin vs others I've had which feel like they just sit on top. Also kudos to the packaging design. It easily dispurses the product with no mess.",4.7,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I am a pretty oily person for the most part. This product moisturizes my face that at the end of a long work day, my face isnt greasy at all compared to if i would of used a thicker cream. I 100% recommend this gel moisturizer to those who are oily!",5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I really love this moisturizer, but the packaging is not good. It's always hard to get the last tablespoon or more worth of moisturizer out of the bottle. Please make it easier to get the top off.",3,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,Used it twice a day as directed and my skin started breaking out. I don't break out a lot so this was unfortunate. This is just my experience.,5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"i have oily acne prone skin, and this broke me out horribly. i really liked it at first due to it's wonderful gel consistency, but had to stop using it since it did not agree with my skin. im sure someone who isn't acne prone with combination skin would love it though. might not be moisturizing enough for dry skin.",5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"Okay as the title said, I genuinely never write reviews but this deserves 5 stars! I have combination skin and have struggled with pretty severe acne for around 10 years. I did a cycle of acc*tane about 2-3 years ago and have been using CeraVe products ever since to try to manage it. I still get pretty severe hormonal acne. My skin is extremely stubborn and does NOT respond well to most products. Everything makes me break out! I had been using CeraVe moisturizing cream for years and yet it just felt too heavy on my skin, but lighter moisturizers from other brands caused my skin to become irritated and dry. After starting to use this gel my skin IMMEDIATELY started clearing up - it hasn't been this clear since I did my acc*tane cycle! I very highly recommend if you have skin like mine.",4.7,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I have combination skin, but the winter months have wrecked my skin! I developed perioral dermatitis around the nose, mouth, and around the eyes; redness; and severely dry and cracked skin around my nose that flaked and pealed that was very painful and itchy. Nothing I tried helped. I used dermatologist recommended thicker creams and ointments tailored to dry cracked skin with no improvements. I got this lightweight gel for Christmas and have only used it for the past week in addition to the Cereve Hydrating Foaming Oil Cleanser and it has completely turned my skin around. Skin problems I've suffered with for months are nearly gone within the week. Very impressed with the formula and results! Definitely a new staple in my skincare routine!",5,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"I love most Cerave products and gave this a try. This is amazing for my combo skin during the day. By the reviews you can see this isnt for everyone, but I found the perfect product for me.",3,,
CeraVe Ultra-Light Gel,"This product is grear for girlies with oily,acne prone skin. It's very lightweight as it says. Not once has it felt greasy on my skin. It works wonderfully under makeup. I would only change the packaging of the product but other than that it's good.",5,,
CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Wash,This cleared my acne in under two weeks. I use it for my chest and face once every 3 days and it works wonders!!,4.6,,
CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Wash,"I've dealt with mild acne my whole life, but it's gotten a bit worse since I've turned 30. I tried this on a whim since benxyol peroxide products do seem to help more than others (I've tried quite a few different brands of gels and creams). Since using this wash, I rarely get breakouts. It hasn't completely stopped my acne, but it is worlds better than what it was. I use it in the morning and before bed. I don't have sensitive skin, but this wash seems pretty gentle. It hasn't dried me out, but I do always apply moisturizer after washing. Just super grateful to have found something that helps.",4,,
CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Wash,"I finally had it with my acne as I recently started breaking out randomly. This helps SO MUCH. It's not magic obviously, but after about a month, my acne decreased by like 75%. I use it consistently with a salicylic acid spot treatment and my acne is practically gone. I DO NOT recommend doing that if you have sensitive skin. Mine is very average ""normal"" The 10% doesnt dry me out or cause irritation. The only annoying thing is if you don't get it 100% off after, you can bleach your clothing. Make sure you rinse really well all over and use a towel you don't care about just in case. Once I rinsed more thoroughly, I didnt have that issue.",1,,
CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Wash,I wouldn't consider my skin sensitive since I use acids and retinol regularly. However whenever I use this cleanser my skin gets tight and feels tingly in the itchy way and looks scaly. I wouldn't recommend for face if you use acids regularly. I haven't tried it on my body but I think would work better for that use.,5,,
CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Wash,"This stuff is so good, I bought it once when it first came out, and I always repurchse when it's empty. My skin is a little dry and I love how benzoyl peroxide works but I hate how drying most formulas are. But this one this doesn't dry my skin out, I can use it every other day with no irritation. I like to let it sit for 4 minutes or so like a mask. It really helps with acne. It's also my secret ingredient for dermaplaning without breaking out. I use it before I dermaplane and after to help keep any acne bacteria from getting pushed around. 10/10.",5,,

CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"This does not feel clean or wash off easily aka emulsify probably because of the castor oil.

CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,Greasy mess. Smells like chemicals. Hard to remove. Went straight in the trash can.,4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"I have bought the Cerave makeup removing cleansing balm multiple times. For the price and quality, it's worth repurchasing. Of course, follow up with another cleanser!",5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"I love this cleanser, it does the job and does not sting my eyes, it is hard to remove once you emulsify it though. What I didn't realize its how expensive it is, I thought I was getting the cheapest option bc its 13 bucks but its too small literally 1 oz.",2,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"Its not a bad product but however there are better products out there and cheaper even. It does have a smell like a plastic smell, doesnt bother me though. I didnt read the amount well and didn't realize how small it is. I wouldn't have boughten it if i knew how small the container was. Save your money and get a different one.",1,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,It removes my makeup well but I cant get past the smell. They claims this to be fragrance free but it has a smell. Kinda smells like essential oils or chemicals. I prefer my true fragrance free ones.,5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"I'm trying to find an affordable cleansing balm, had super high hopes for this one. My first note, yes you're paying a more drugstore price but holy moly is this jar small. Does the cleansing balm work? Yes, have I tried cleansing balms that work a bit better and doesn't require using as much? Yes. My main gripe though is that I'm not someone with super sensitive eyes whatsoever and there is something in here that BURNS the ever loving life out of my eyes. I was so shocked because it's CeraVe and it's supposed to be gentle but my god, this stuff burned my eyes like no tomorrow. I can't recommend at all, CeraVe does have great products but for me anyways this is far from one of them.",4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"I have sensitive skin especially towards bacteria , when i put this on to remove my makeup it removess!!!! And when i leave the balm on ( i know youre not supposed to ) it litterally removes my dark marks dark fades , acne. My skin be looking so smooth and clear. 10/10 dont change the formula CERAVE",5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,I love CEREVE products but these smells horrible.,2,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,Very good product.,2,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"I honestly feel stupid for buying this product because I previously bought the cream-to-foam version of this cleanser and absolutely hated it. I should have assumed this would be the same. It advertises makeup removing, even uses an icon of a mascara wand, but the directions say ""do not come in contact with eyes"" and boy are they right, because it stings like crazy. I have to use eye drops after because my eyes are burning. Also no matter how hard you try to avoid your mouth it will seep in and taste like crap.",5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"This does not emulsify, it is very difficult to remove, and it did not remove my waterproof makeup (mascara). I broke out terribly because the product does not fully rinse off. Returned it.",4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"I was skeptical about using this because I usually dont do well with balms and prefer cleansing oils. However this stuff blew me away! It easily melts my makeup and lifts it off of my skin. The only things I dont like is thete is too little product and that it doesn't emulsify, but I just wash with my Cerave Hydrating to Foam cleanser and use Thayers unscented Witch Hazel after and it completely removes everything while keeping my skin soft and plump. This is my new holy grail routine!",5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,This works for taking off my makeup very well. I like that there are no fragrances but because of that it does smell like the oil that is in the product. To me it washes off well. I also am a fan because if the price.,2,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,I cant get over the chemical smell. I will be returning this product,2,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"it gets the job done, but it does leave a sticky thick residue after and doesnt seem like going away with water",5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"Bought this cleansing balm because I generally trust CeraVe skin products - I use their AM and PM moisturizers regularly with almost no problems. I bought this cleansing balm in March 2024, and I noticed that since around that time, I've been having regular breakouts on my cheeks and jawline. (Disclaimer: I have PCOS so I'm already acne-prone, but for about a year before that my acne was well under control.) Given the timing and the fact that I'd changed nothing in my diet or skincare routine, I highly suspect this cleansing balm is the culprit. It does remove makeup for the most part, but I found that I still had to wipe it off even after rinsing with water before going in with my normal cleanser. I wouldn't buy this product again.",4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,This cleansing balm worked well but OMG the smell was so bad and it lingered even after i washed my face. It smellls like chemicals and latex and it is STRONG. I definitely will return immediately,5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"I am truly impressed by not only how well this performed but how long it lasted. The container may be small, but you don't need to use up much product at once for it to be effective. It doesn't irritate my skin nor does it make me breakout, and it makes removing makeup a much easier process. I also like to use this to double cleanse even when I have no makeup on, to give myself that really clean feeling. This is a win for anyone with sensitive and/or are acne prone skin, especially since it's fragrance-free! **P.S. It's rare for me to rate something 5 stars, but this truly deserves it! I have no complaints whatsoever and will keep this as a go-to always.",2,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"It is super gentle on my skin and I don't feel a burning sensation after like I have with some other balms I've tried! I do have to give a little extra love for it to remove my mascara though. Overall, would highly recommend for the sensitive skin people!",2,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,I've used a few different makeup removing balms and this is definitely my favorite. You need such a small amount of the product that it seems to last forever. It's unscented which is a must for me when it comes to skincare and it has completely eliminated makeup removing wipes from my product list!,1,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"This is a great value, and I think it might be a new favorite balm of mine. There is no favorite. This is easy to use, didn't cause any breakouts, and made my skin feel clean. If I was wearing make up or just sunscreen, this was always nice to use at the end of the day",4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,I love this product! I use this every night. It takes only a small amount and it easily and gently removes my makeup. Even waterproof mascara. Sometimes I use it alone and sometimes I cleanse with the Cerave foaming wash after.,5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,best cleaning balm to remove foundation and mascara. the product lasts forever as only a small amount will remove makeup from the entire face and eyes.,2,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"I found this to be great at getting makeup off, just make sure you wash it off all the way. The cleanser itself is so smooth and creamy, it feels nice to put it on your skin. Would recommend for those who wear makeup often!",5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"How do people sleep on this ? This typically one of the most effective make up remover balm that i ever used ! It's affordable and working so well on my face. As i usually make up twice a week i find it's hard to only remove it with micellar water. I search for the balm , this got my attention. Use it with warm water. Worked so well. All cleaned up after a few massages. Then i used the cerave make up remover wet paper and then foam cleanser that last. That my triple cleans for my face. To remove all the make up and dirts and oil ( or balm left) after a day. It's gentle and doesn't causing me any trouble skin. Later on i can go on with my skincare routine!",5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,This product feels like wax on your face. Its hard to get off and you definitely need to scrub hard after taking this off with another cleanser. I would not recommend.,4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,I love this product!! It's my go to make up remover. I can't live without this in my skin care routine. The balm is so soft one the skin and you feel clean and hydrated right after. The size is perfect for travel and lasts a long time!,5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"I like the texture of this cleansing balm and my skin was soft after using it and following with the CeraVe toner, but the smell of the product is off-putting. The pot I purchased has quite a chemical smell. :(",2,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"Bought this for traveling and it works great. I have dry, sensitive skin and had no issues. Only con is the smell, but I'd still recommend it.",1,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,I am loving this product. I have used high end brands of makeup melting balm and this one is just as effective. It melts off my makeup instantly and cleanses my face perfectly. It is fragrance free and doesn't break me out.,5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"If you don't double cleanse after using make up, today is the day to start! This make up cleanser balm is so hydrating and smooth and literally melts the make up off your face. This product plus the hydrating cream facial wash will leave your skin hydrated and moisturized! It's so great for sensitive skin with no smells of perfume or harsh chemicals.",4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,I switched to this when my skin was going through a dry/rough spell because I thought it'd be gentler and this is my favorite remover. It cuts through makeup and leaves my skin feeling supple and hydrated.,5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"The CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleanser Balm is a game-changer for anyone looking for an effective and gentle way to remove makeup. Its rich, creamy texture melts away even stubborn, long-wearing products without stripping the skin of its natural moisture. I love how easily it emulsifies with water, rinsing away cleanly without leaving any residue behind. Plus, its non-comedogenic formula means it won't clog pores or cause breakouts, making it suitable for all skin types, including sensitive and acne-prone skin. While it effectively removes makeup, I've found that it may require a bit of extra effort for heavy eye makeup or waterproof products. Overall, it's a fantastic option for daily makeup removal that leaves skin feeling clean, soft, and hydrated.",2,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"As you can see from the second picture, I have some pretty severe facial eczema. I have been using this product for about a month to take my mascara off and it has a buttery melting effect when applied and leaves my skin feeling very hydrated. It takes my makeup off without damaging my skin or my lashes. It smells pleasant but not overly fragrant. I cannot tolerate overly fragrant products on my skin because it will cause my skin to have a really bad flare up from my skin condition. I would highly recommend to anyone with sensitive skin in need of a good makeup remover.",5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"This smells awful! It works fine, and rinses off well, but the smell is just too much for me.",5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,Stubborn Makeup? With CeraVe makeup Removing Balm will certainly do the trick! On DRY face get a dime size and rub onto DRY face in circular motion and you shortly see your makeup MELTING off your face! Wash Throughly with water! after using this product use hydrating cream to foam cleanser to wash off after using cleanser balm.Ôøº it has three essential ceramides.,4.3,,

CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,I love the consistency of how it feels on my face but the smell is terrible and can be a big turn off for people.,2,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,horrible. doesn't take makeup off. don't waste your money. Tru E.L.F way better,5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"This is very similar to the inky list makeup remover, however it feels less oily on the skin. I feel with the inky list I have to really scrub to get the oil off and this remover does not feel that way, yet is still just as effective. The bottle is extremely small tho and they don't have a bigger one.",4,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,This product is really good because it removes your make up and melt it all off and the scent smells so good it smells like rubbing alcohol but that's good and the packaging looks just like the hydrating facial cleanser make sure to go check that out and the ingredients are a clean up and the texture feels chunky and good üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ,4.3,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"This cleansing balm was generally effective in removing my makeup while not irritating my skin, but I noticed that it took some effort to remove my non-waterproof mascara. I agree with other reviewers that it has a strange chemical smell. I would've expected a totally unscented product from CeraVe.",5,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,"If you're looking for a dupe for the Clinique makeup removing balm, this is it. Definitely does it's job and I love Cereve as a skincare line for problem skin so it's sensitive skin friendly as well.",2,,
CeraVe Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm,I should have read the ingredients more carefully. I love cereve products so I didn't do my do dilligance and now I have red skin and itritsted skin by my eyes. I used it to remove my fill face of makeup and when I finished it went straight in the trash.,5,,

CeraVe SA Lotion,I just started using this product last week using it every other day. I have noticed the bumps on the back of my arms and legs have gone down in just 3 uses. There is still red pigmentation but I'm excited to continue using this product. It goes on smooth with no fragrance (which I like) but it takes awhile to rub in.,5,,
CeraVe SA Lotion,I use this product 1-2x daily for my keratosis pilaris (chicken skin). I have definitely seem improvement in my kp but it has not resolved completely. The lotion is hydrating and helps to smooth out my skin,5,,
CeraVe SA Lotion,Leaves my skin so moisturized and keeps the pimples at bay. No scent and thick application that dries clear. Honestly I think this product is working really well for me so far! It's a keeper.,4.5,,
CeraVe SA Lotion,Dont get any results and the cost of the product is very high than benefits and benefits of the product is zero,5,,
CeraVe SA Lotion,"I would like to share a review of SA softening cleansing gel CeraVe for dry, rough and uneven skin. It was with this product that my acquaintance with the brand began. To begin with, I will describe the condition of my skin - very dry, reactive, red, flaky, irritated at the slightest disturbance in care or nutrition. I liked Cerave for its relatively low price with a significant volume of product, the manufacturer declared that it does not contain fragrances, alcohols, dyes, and is produced in France. The brand's products were developed jointly with dermatologists and ophthalmologists. The entire Serave line is based on the inclusion of 3 essential ceramides in the products. The composition of this product is simple and concise - ceramides, hyaluronic and salicylic acids. Simple and nothing extra. Hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic.",1,,
CeraVe SA Lotion,I like this lotion. After shaving this is a must. I have seen improvement on my skin after using this product for over a month. I highly recommend it. The texture is nice and it's scent free.,5,,
CeraVe SA Lotion,It works well on smoothing out my skin but is too light for my dry skin. Otherwise very light scent and not greasy. I use frequently on my legs and arms to reduce KP and it has worked pretty well. Remember to wear sunscreen after wards!,1,,
CeraVe SA Lotion,The way this made the the heels of my feet feel! You don't even have to put on socks to let this soak in. Rub it on your feet once a day and I promise you will not regret it! It's a little pricier than your average lotion but you are saving on pedicures. My feet were so dry and cracked and this lotion worked a miracle!,4.5,,
CeraVe SA Lotion,"CeraVe SA Lotion for Rough & Bumpy Skin has been a game-changer for me! It effectively smooths and hydrates rough patches, leaving my skin feeling incredibly soft. The salicylic acid helps exfoliate, reducing bumps and improving texture. Definitely a 5-star product in my skincare routine.",5,,
CeraVe SA Lotion,I have kp on my arms but after using this paired with a body scrub my kp has gone down so much and has made it much smoother im definitely gonna try the other cerave sa products,1,,
CeraVe SA Lotion,I'm using this Cerave SA Lotion for Rough & Bumpy Skin for a year now. I do have a rough skin and it's really helped me . It's really helped me to fix my skin rough to normal. It's has salicylic acid and vitamin D. Which helps me to hydrate my skin and it's normal now.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"I typically cant say this about most products, but within the first week of use, I can clearly tell a difference. As described, my skin already looks brighter and more even. I don't suffer from acne, yet my face is heavily textured and pocked with visible pores. So far at each use, I immediately find myself sloughing off dead skin, leaving my face incredibly soft. Next morning, it looks bright. So far this product has been a game changer!",4.6,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"I use this once a week and is a good counter to using retinols. What that looks like for me is the night before I use this product, I only moisturize, no extra treatments. Then exfoliate and follow it with a light moisturizer (generally the CeraVe moisturizing lotion, just a small amount) and wash it off in the morning. The next night I do a deeper moisturizer then do retinol for 5 nights with a light moisturizer on top, rest night, exfoliate, then rest again. This has done wonders for my hyper pigmented and sensitive skin. Do NOT apply on wet or damp skin because then it will cause a slight burning sensation. This has been what works well for me (for cleanser I use the hydrating cream to foam CeraVe has and everyday moisturizer is the daily moisture lotion).",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"This is the best stuff I've ever used on my skin. My pores are smaller, the blackheads on my nose a have all but vanished, my fine lines and acne scars are fading and my skin is so bright and soft. I have sensitive skin so I was hesitant, but I always follow with a food moisturizer and haven't had any major issues (occasional flaking skin).",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,It smells bad but I see a good improvement In my skin as I have used this for a couple of weeks now. But after first day whenever I apply it I get a bit of a burning sensation for a couple of minutes. After it's absorbed it's fine. Is this something normal? Or? Am I ignoring a warning sign?,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"This is my favorite cerave product, not sure if the ingredients are better for my skin type than others but using it I noticed and even people around me were telling me how my skin was better, I have had acne my entire life and on my late 20's I had a terrible break out that left me with scars, uneven skin tone, and bad skin in general, this product helped me with all that, my skin was softer and healthier, this exfoliante it's a blend of glycolic acid that has the smallest molecule so it can go deeper on the skin and lactic acid that hydrates and exfoliate the skin softly, I used it nightly it didn't irritate my skin or anything when I finished the bottle I didn't get another one because I started using tetrinoin and you can't mixed those ingredients, I'm thinking on adding it again to my routine and take a break for the tetrinoin.",4,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,I wanted to love this so badly but the smell was horrible & my skin immediately started burning. I gave it 10 minutes and then had to rinse it off. I love all of my Cerave products - I only use them on my skin. But unfortunately this one wasn't for me. I do have very sensitive skin so I'm sure it's just that but I'd say this isn't for people like me.,4.6,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"I've been using Cerave products for years without incident. I recently purchased all the Cerave Skin Renewing product line. Used the Night Exfoliating Treatment for the first time followed by the night cream (which I've used before) and woke up this morning with a red itchy rash, like a sunburn, all over my face. . Should I be using the exfoliating treatment on its own?",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,I am 64 and have been using this product for 2 months‚Ä¶my skin is smoother and feels more healthy. I feel it keeps pores clear and no build up in nasal crease where I tend to get black heads occasionally ‚Ä¶but not anymore. Love it!,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"I used this retinol about a year ago and I noticed my skin was at its peak! I usually have clear skin but this took it to another level - my skin was brighter, softer, clear, and plump! I intented to re-purchased earlier this year and accidentally got the other purple cerave retinol - which works fine, it just doesn't compare to this exfoliating one. One thing I will say is that it took about a week or two for my skin to adjust to it. I felt a slight burn the first few nights, so I would apply every other night for 1 week, then every night the next week and everything went smoothly after that. 11/10 recommend!",2,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"One the 3rd night of use, I woke up in the middle of the night with a horrendous burning rash on my face. Not sure if this product should actually be used nightly; perhaps every 3 days is more appropriate.",2,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"I'm 67 and for decades I've fought dry, red dead flakes of stacked up skin cells around corners of my lips, creases of my nostrils and under my jawline and eyebrows.

CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"I feel like my face is redder than usual, around my mouth, chin and nose? Maybe it's not related, maybe it's sensitivity to sun... Idk. I wear sunscreen, and use this product at night. Or I'm just ugly.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,This product CHANGED my skin. I have suffered from adult acne for years.

CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"I bought this couple months ago, I use it almost every night. I use it alone after washing my face, I'll apply a night cream at times.

CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,As someone with dry skin- I am always looking for products with ceramides as my skin loves them! This exfoliating treatment is gentle yet effective at keeping my pores clear and clean. Liquid exfoliates are my new favorite and this one works!,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"Since I am over 30, I started using retinol serum in the nighttime, so have been using this every other night, alternating with the retinol one The consistency is soft and lighter than I expected and the application was not greasy and it also did not clog the pores Compared to other acidic treatment I have tried; it is much gentler and did not leave any heavy feeling Using together at night with CeraVe hydrating toner, I noticed my skin glowing and becoming even toned more in the morning I have some pores on my nose area, and in the morning, they have become reduced. However, I did not notice any decrease in the fine lines and wrinkles Because it has an affordable price tag, I would recommend everyone looking for effective treatment to give it a try.",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,I have been suing this serum for a few weeks now as the weather is cool down my skin is dryer than usual and this has been helping a lot. It is light weight and leaves your skin soft,1,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"I really like the feel of this product. I've noticed my skin looking smoother after consistent use. My only issue is it has a weird smell.

CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"As a rule, I would not recommend anyone use exfoliating ingredients nightly. I prefer my pm moisturizer to be a standalone product with only barrier supporting ingredients. However, this did not irritate my skin.",5,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,I love that this is fragrance free and it doesn't irritate my skin. It absorbs well and has a light feel to it. There is no grainy texture either. I need to keep using it more I think to see more long term results.,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"I used this for about 2 weeks and had a noticeable change in the texture/smoothness of my skin. I usually have very rough almost scaly patches on my face and this has all but gotten rid of them. 10/10 would recommend. The only drawback is you absolutely must use sunscreen or a sunblock, otherwise you will burn very easily.",4,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,I am loving the Cerave nightly exfoliating treatment. The glycolic and lactic as is are so gentle and don't break out my sensitive skin. I have been using it for a few weeks now cycling throughout the week and my skin has cleared up so much,4.6,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,I wasn't sure what to expect from this product but it has been a welcome addition to my skin care routine. It is now my go to for my exfoliation nights and it works great. I use it 2 nights per week and have noticed a difference in how soft and smooth my skin looks and feels. The ingredients aren't harsh and it could be used more often if needed. It's also fairly affordable for a skin care product and easy to find in stores. I would absolutely purchase this and recommend to friends.,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,I really enjoyed this product! It's gentle and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"A teenager in the 90s, I always thought ""exfoliating"" had to include rough beads, salt, or pulverized apricot pits in order to smooth the skin. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to add this to my nighttime skin routine. There's no scrubbing and the layers of face skin remain in tact. After a week or so I can already feel it smoothing my skin!",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,I love how Cerave makes products with only the good stuff for your skin! They all work and most importantly they are not sold with a crazy markup. This treatment is another example. My skin reacted well and I was able to see results pretty quickly! Make sure to use a sunscreen the following morning!,4.6,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,After cleansing and applying toner on my face then it was prepared for this exfoliating nightly cream. Not sure why it is called exfoliating since it doesn't have any exfoliating pearls or so. Overall opinion is good and leaved good face feeling,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"As a beauty professional, active in the industry for 20+ years, I found this CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment is a super gentle facial treatment. It's texture is very soft, creamy, scentless, and isn't sticky. It's fast absorbing which I'm impressed with as well. I have a dry skin type all year round so I was extremely excited to find out this product has three essential ceramides in it. One ceramides is for cellular rejuvenation, another gives a smoother, more radiant skin tone. CeraVe's Exfoliating Night Treatment has AHA's in it as well. While using this product be diligent in applying sunscreen daily as your skin will be far more sensitive to sunburns. This product non greasy, and won't clog pores. It's dermatologist tested, and recommend for all skin types. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for anti ageing skincare products, with AHA ingredients inside.",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,The CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment really made my face feel smooth and soft in the morning. it was easy to add to my routine.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,Noticeably smoother in my rougher areas of cheeks and forehead.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"I liked the exfoliation treatment. Woke up with smooth, soft skin. I added a moisturizer on top of it as suggested on the bottle. I would buy this product",4.6,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"I received this CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment sample in return of my honest opinion. I have used it for a couple weeks now expecting better results than the ones achieved. I have trouble skin lately, my face turns red and it looks patchy so I am trying to find something that will bring my glow back! This is more like a lotion rather than an exfoliating product, I do not feel the texture to be doing any of what other exfoliants do. The consistency is light and not greasy and as directed, you are supposed to use it at night. I am continuing to use it to see if there are any other benefits that I have not noticed as of yet. If trying to remove dead skin, I do not recommend it.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"Cerave never lets me down! The makeup wipes are super soft and not harsh at all, the toner leaves me skin feeling clean but never dry, and I'm excited to keep using the over night treatment to see results!",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,Applies smoothly and absorbs nicely into the skin. Made my face look and feel refreshed in the morning.,4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,Used it for over a week and definitely feel my skin being more supple. I definitely recommend.,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,"I really liked the way these makeup wipes worked. They through removed some very stubborn makeup. However, they left a sticky film on my face that I felt like I needed to wash off even though they say you shouldn't have to.",4.6,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,I have combination skin and most retinols are too harsh for me to use. This is the first retinol I have used that has been continuously gentle on my skin. I love that I can use it almost everyday and it doesn't irritate my skin.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment,I have been using CeraVe skin renewing nightly exfoliating treatment for about a week now. I love how easy it is to use. I put it on after I wash my face before bed. I love how it helps my skin look and feel younger. I have started noticing a difference in my facial skin already. I love how beautiful and young my face is looking .,3,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,"Great for when you don't have the energy at the end of a long day for your full nighttime skin routine. But when i do have enough time and energy, i use this as a part of double cleansing. Another great product from Cerave!!!!!",4.1,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,This melts any make up including waterproof,5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,"I bought one bottle at first. It seemed to do the job. It does remove makeup well. Although it it stings the eyes, i was willing to put up with it and try really hard not to get it in my eye when using for the face. I thought i liked it so i bought two more. It turns out that this micellar water is the reason for my irritated and itchy skin and i didn't realize it until i started using it on my body to remove sunscreen. I get bumpy and itchy skin after using it. Then the next day i have pustular looking acne on my back and arms. For reference, I have KP, sensitive and reactive skin that is combination and has acne. I have a consistent routine that includes daily sunscreen wearing and occasional light makeup. If you purchase this, pay attention to the next week or two and see how your skin reacts. Hopefully you can return it immediately.",1,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,On late nights when I don't wanna wash my face this is my holy grail. It removes all my makeup in just a couple swipes. I have eczema prone skin and this product does not effect my skin. The only thing i feel like its a bit overpriced. All in all 9/10. Check out my other reviews!,5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,"I truly am such a fan of this entire brand so I hate to write a negative review about them, but this product was very disappointing. I wear a lot of makeup some days, especially around the eyes so I need a (and have found some) makeup remover that is safe in and around the eye area. This is NOT that. Even a small press against closed eyes made my eyes burn for at least 30 seconds. It did, however, take every last trace of my makeup off which was convenient. Since I always wear eye makeup on days I wear makeup, I will be returning this product. Perhaps their makeup removing balm will be gentler on the eyes.",5,,

CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,i patch test everything but have not had any issues show up until this. I put some on a large area of my inner forearm and a little more than 24 hours later had a bout of intense itching and redness that could not be attributed to anything else. short -lived but obviously a bad sign. There are some great ingredients but also a lot of unpronounceables.,4.1,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,I use this affordable makeup remover daily! It gets even the most stubborn makeup off! The packaging makes it easy to open in the shower. A+ product!,5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,"I love this micellar water, I got my Rinoplastia and the doctor told me not to wash my face for a long time and this micellar water helped me to not get any pimples on my face, it's fragrance free and it has a good price for the amount of water that has so it's a 10/10",1,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,The Cerave Hydrating Micellar Water is a great product. It is gentle on your skin and removes all of your make up easily. I have switched many products over to products from the Cerave brand and I have not been disappointed with any of them yet. This is a great brand that is recommended by dermatologist. It has great ingredients and does not irritate my skin. I will definitely buy this product again and would recommend it to others. Ôøº,2,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,i love this specific product I use it to get rid of my mascara underneath my eyes or on top of my eyes. I definitely recommend this for anyone uses mascara.,5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,"I have tried cleansing balms and other makeup removers. I didnt like how greasy and oily most cleansing balms felt and how when it gets in your eyes, it fogs your vision. Other micellar waters left my face dry. This however is now my go-to! It doesnt dry out my face and doesnt bother my eyes. I have sensitive skin and this works GREAT!!!",4.1,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,Works will on sensitive skin those not dry your skin out.,5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,My skin is very sensitive & dry. This product did not irritate my skin. Love it!,1,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,I really felt like this cleansed my skin well and got all my make up off. I like the ease of using it to. I literally keep it and cotton pads in my night stand.,5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,Another amazing cerave product! This has become one of my favorite micellar waters! It's made with great ingredients and is so effective in removing makeup. It's affordable too! Highly recommended!,4,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,"I bought it because it was recommended by dermatologist and it received many good reviews. It worked well for me. I use sunscreen everyday so water cleaner is a must for me. Good price, gentle clean, my face doesn't feel dry after using it. You should give a try. One coin thing is if you have heavy make up, you need to use more of this product to get all your makeup off. You better use an oil cleanser.",4.1,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,quwu,5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,Does this remove my makeup‚Ä¶ yes. However it stings/burns my eyes no matter how careful I am. I will finish the bottle but will not be repurchasing,1,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,Would continue to buy,5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,Love IT! Great for dry and sensitive skin,4,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,This is super great. I used to use the garnier one but honestly I feel like it was greasy. This is not greasy at all. Leave my skin feeling hydrated before I go in with toner. It takes off my makeup well so I like it and my skin feels nice and clean after.,4.1,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,I wear wing liner every day and I have been getting lazy and using wipes to remove my makeup. I decided to ditch the wipes and replace them with this Micellar water. I use the micellar water on a makeup eraser and it removes 1000% of my liquid eyeliner and mascara. The wipes I had been using would leave residue and never remove all my mascara. This micellar water is gentle on the eyes and doesn't burn at all. I do follow up with a face wash but I certainly don't feel like HAAAVE to. It's a clean easy way to remove makeup if you're a little lazy like me. I've never used anything from Cerave before this and now I'm curious to try more from the line.,5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,"I used this at night to remove eye makeup. I used with a cotton pad‚Ä¶ I got chemical burns underneath my eyes that are so painful and it stings. Expected better with Cerave, but over the years the products must've changed. My skin doesn't tolerate their new formulas and this micellar water burned my skin raw!!",1,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,"this micellar water is super hydrating, theres no oily feeling or film on your skin afterwards. it gets my mascara off super easy where as others it takes more effort. this doesnt sting or have a scent. i run through bottles of this! good for sensitive skin.",5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,"My skin tends fo get irritated by most makeup remover products, especially the skin around my eyes. I do not get any irritation or burning at all with this one! It also removes my makeup extremely well.",5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,"I love the Michelle's water because it's so easy to take off dirt and makeup from the day. If all fails abd I don't do my skincare routine, I am always using this to at least clean my face!",4.1,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,"This does a great job of cleaning my skin and any makeup. However, when I used it on my eyes I noticed a lot of lash fallout. Now I use this on my cheeks and forehead but use an oil cleanser on my lashes and do not have this issue anymore.",5,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,"I can't use Cerave cleaners or lotions my skin is SO sensitive and breaks out. This is GREAT! Finally one that's Fragrance Free, not as drying as some Micellar can be. Inhighly recommend for sensitive skin. I Did NOTE: I did not use on my eyes so I cant speak to that.",1,,
CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water,"With so many allergies, and sensitivity to many products, this is a safe bet for me. I use it every evening on a cotton pad to take off makeup before washing my face.It is very gentle yet affective. No fragrance. It has become hard to find in stores. CeraVe needs to keep making this product. I would be lost without it.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Gel Oil,I love this product. I even went back a week later and bought another bottle since it was on sale,4.5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Gel Oil,Best oil for sensitive skin. Provides mosture without breakouts. Please keep selling!,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Gel Oil,"I am 36 and recently noticed my skin is becoming more sensitive and dry as I age. Moisturing toners and moisturizers werent enough.

CeraVe Skin Renewing Gel Oil,"Love the way it feels on my skin, not greasy or overpowering. Leaves my face feeling smooth and it doesn't clog my pores. Sets my powder without overwhelming or caking. I will definitely buy this product again.",5,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Gel Oil,"I bought this to heal wind and cold burn I got last winter. It did a fabulous job, healing my skin very quickly. I have acne prone combination skin and I would never be able to use this on my face on a regular basis. I regularly get chapped lips and this stuff is amazing. I couldn't find my lip balm and tried this, now I use it on my lips daily, and they stay so soft and hydrated. I highly recommend this for healing any skin in need of extra care. But def avoid acne prone skin unless you're in need of healing, as in from over cleansing, sunburn, windburn, or cold burn.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Gel Oil,"I'm 63 with sensitive, dry skin. My face texture has improved and is smooth as can be inside if 2 weeks!",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Gel Oil,I use this primarily Under and around my eyes. And at night as it takes a while to absorb . LOVE,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Gel Oil,"Love this product! I hope Cerave never discontinues this one! After using Cerave's Hydrating Facial Cleanser, I mix together Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion with a bit of L'Oreal Revitalift Hyaluronic Acid Serum. After that absorbs, I use less than a pea-sized amount of the Cerave Skin Renewing Gel Oil. (A little goes a long way!) It gives the perfect glow and my skin feels ultra moisturized all day. This gel oil has already made a difference in my skin care routine's effectiveness. It has absolutely improved the hydration of my skin and fine lines around my eyes are looking less noticeable. What's not to like? (BTW, I have sensitive skin and zero issues for me.) If you don't want to pair this with your makeup, you can always just use this before bed for its amazing deep moisturizing properties.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Gel Oil,"This did not disappear and kept my sensitive, overly dry 64 year old skin moist all day. I use it night and day. Only complaint is that it doesn't dry down for a while which isn't a bother really. It allows me to use a powder foundation. It keeps my skin very hydrated and I don't feel like a dried prune at the end of a 10 or 12 hour work day. Which is amazing.",4.5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Gel Oil,Thus is the best product. I mix it with my moisturizer daily and it's not greasy and my face feels hydrated. I absolutely loce this stuff.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Gel Oil,AMAZING. This oil is so light and works well with & brings out the best in any skin care products used in conjunction with it. So worth the money. I hope they never change the formula or discontinue it. My skin looks dewy fresh.,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Gel Oil,"I've been using this product for years and keep going back to it. There's just something so useful about a face oil with only a few ingredients, especially for sensitive skin. It does everything an oil is supposed to do and I use it for everything. I add it to my moisturizer when I want a little more oomph, I apply it directly to my face after my weekly exfoliation as a skin soother, I use it on my cuticles, I use it on my heels, I use it as a scar cream, I use it on the ends of my hair‚Ä¶ it's such a workhorse. I love that, because it's a gel, it never leaks out of the package so it's never messy. It never breaks me out or flares my sensitive skin. A bottle lasts forever. Ugh, so many good things to say about this product.",4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,waaaay to thick and drying. leaves an awful white cast and residue. i can't use it on my face because it messes up my makeup. i've been using it on my neck just to get rid of it,4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,Really like the way this mattifies on the skin when I placed my blush on top it looked so smooth. I appreciate it having SPF as I'm in the sun often,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,"I am soooo enchanted by this cream. Is so smooth and smells so good! Very hydrating as I use Tretnoin and it leaves my skin feeling dry and tight, but this paired with COSrx is chef's kiss",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,Doesn't absorb into the skin well. Leaves a faint white residue that fades away over time. I personally don't think its worth the price; there are better creams out there.,2,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,"The pump is ineffective after only a few uses. Significant residue on the skin, so much so that others have pointed it out worried it was my skin or bad make up application :/",5,,

CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,This product comes out extremely thick. It does not spread easily. It pulls your skin as you're trying to get it on and then once it is on it pills there is little white pieces all over your face! I am returning this garbage.,4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,Cover nice and smooth,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,I usually really like CeraVe products but this one was disappointing. Hopped in the car and looked in the mirror only to see white flakes all over my neck and lower face. I was hoping it wouls be a good day mositurizer but it appears to just be sunscreen. This was my first and last try with this particular product.,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,"I have trusted Cerave products for the past 12-15 years. However this day cream broke that trust. It left my face splotchy like, piling and flaky. I cant even return it sice i threw the box away.",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,This is my favorite daily sunscreen lotion.It doesn't leave your face sticky or greasy and it will never burn and get into your eyes at the end of the day. The only bad thing is the dispenser. You can't get all the stuff out and you have to unscrew the lid and poke around in there with something to get any and it's too expensive to be dealing with all that nonsense. I recommend this product. Not dislike the dispenser.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,It's amazing. Already I use everyday and I get good result.,4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,Leaves a while film all over the face. Doesn't blend in well. Also drying. I wish I didn't buy it.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,Honestly this product was not my favorite. I absolutely love that it's a renewing day cream that has an SPF in it. But product has a flaky leave afterwards. And I have even use the product without combating products on my face and it still has a flaky after effect. But I applaud it for trying to be multifunctional.Ôøº,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,"I do not like using this product. I purchased this after taking the CeraVe skin quiz, which suggested using this product after the Skin Renewing Vitamin C serum. At first I thought it was the serum which was causing the pills, so I tried waiting 15-30 minutes after applying the serum, but it still pills. I've tried using this product after washing my face without using the serum, and it still pills. It's super annoying. I also feel like it just sits on top of my skin and doesn't absorb well. I like using the the Vitamin C serum so I will be looking for something else to use as a daytime moisturizer.",5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,I love this sun protectant! It goes on smoothly and the white cast blends in easily *I do have fair Caucasian skin* I think those who are experiencing flaking and pilling after applying are most likely using this silicone based product with another product that isn't silicone based that is acting as a repellant.,1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,I really wanted to like this product. However this products peels and leave a white cast.,4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,I bought the whole line for a morning and night time skincare routine and this is the only product I regret purchasing. I have white flakes all over my face after applying and it actually makes my skin look awful and my hairline has white flakes which looks like horrible dandruff. I was really hoping all the products would work together. Disappointed in the money I spent for this.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,After applying to clean dry skin - it rolls and pills. Awful. I've even tried waiting until my skin is much drier an hour later - same issue. I like to use the full line when selecting my routine. This may be a game changer.,3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,I am so disappointed in this product. It goes on white making my skin look pale and it is so thick. I can barely get it to spread over my face and am probably giving myself wrinkles with how hard it is to spread into your skin especially the eye area.,2,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,"I love the brand and overall it's a great product. The lotion does leave a slight, white cast if you layer a primer or any other product over it. Keep that in mind. Over than that, it works great.",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,"I love all Cerave products but the consistency of this product is disappointing. I felt like I was putting zinc sunscreen on my face. Does not feel moisturizing at all on my face and difficult to rub in. It Looks like I have dry, flaky skin after I put it on. Switching to just a normal Cerave moisturizer.",4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,I like the product but have consistent issues getting it out of the bottle. Stopped pumping with product still in the bottle on the last 2 bottles I purchased. FRUSTRATING !,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,"I had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately, it doesn't blend well, leaves a noticeable white cast, and tends to peel off the skin.",3,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,"I have always heard good things about CeraVe, so when looking for a new moisturizer, I thought I would give it a try. I always look for moisturizers with retinol because I'm not getting any younger. This particular moisturizer leaves my face feeling and looking extremely dry.",2,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,"I was really looking forward to trying this as I have used other cerave products. I was so disappointed. Does not absorb well leaving white film on skin. I expected it to be fragrance free but in fact I used it twice and smelled something strange. My husband says it smells like milk that's gone off, somewhat cheesy. Awful, I can't use it. I also found some of he white film flakes off during the day",1,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,"After it dries, it looks and feels gross on my face. Almost like it's peeling, or like a have fuzz from paper or something. In my eyebrows, even worse, like dandruff. Thought it was me until I read similar reviews.",4,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,As mentioned in previous review. It does leave a white film and flaking all over face. Does not absorb into skin. I also really wanted to like the cream and now I need to start over with looking for a moisturizer.,5,,
CeraVe Skin Renewing Day Cream,"Omgosh what a hot mess. My skin has a white cast, it's flaky and I literally can't wear my make up with this product. I have the entire line of cereve products and love them all. So so very disappointed in the cream. Will not buy again and throwing this one in trash!",3,,

CeraVe Acne Control Gel,"I usually like Cerave products. their moisturizer is my gold standard I compare everything by. But this acne gel leaves something to be desired. I've used over 1/2 the tube, but never liked it. It pills up on your face if you rub it and doesn't seem to soak in. I got whiteheads on my nose and in the folds every time I used it, so I just stopped putting it there. I prefer to get my salicylic acid and glycolic in a different form than this.",4.3,,

CeraVe Acne Control Gel,Even though I am 60 years old I still have such an oily face & this product works great!,2,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,"Instead of clearing my acne, it started to make my acne worse. I've used this two times in the past year and both of those times I have began to break out.",2,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,I only had product for about week n half but it stop my skin from being so oily/ dry.,4.3,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,"I had really high hopes for this as the ingredients are great, but please check your new bottles, as mine had coconut acid listed towards the bottom. Coconut acid can be very comedogenic, which is confusing to be added to an acne wash.",4,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,I tried this for about 1 month and in the beginning it worked great. But after a few uses I started to breakout in hives whenever I used this product. Do not use this product if you have super sensitive skin or is allergic to many acids!! I do not recommend.,1,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,"(for context i have evry sensitive skin) I orded this face wash like a week ago ive been using it everday with no problems, it wasnt clearing anything that soon but it just seemed like a normal facewash. I wasnt even gonna leave a review but last night i went to use it and immediately after putting it on my face started burning around the cheeks/mouth and chin area. i washed it off and woke up to red rashes and skin peeling. the thing i was most confused about is why the flare came out of nowhere istead of the beginning but I looked it up and seen other people have had the same problem. i wouldn't recommend on sensitive skin.",3,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,I've been using it for 2 months and it does nothing to clear my acne. I really don't like the smell of it either.,3,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,"My skin is not prone to acne, but I do get a lot of small breakouts and pimples. This face wash cleared my skin like no other product has ever!!!!! It took a little bit of time to notice the results (maybe a month?) but ever since I've been using it, I have not experienced any breakouts or random spots. I have combo skin and it does dry my skin out a bit but not to the point that its stiff or uncomfortable - I just pair with a light moisturizer. My skin feels clean, but not stripped. Would totally recommend for anyone with mild acne. Love u cera ve",4.3,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,the app has the wrong ingredients listed for this product,4,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,When I say I love this product!!!! I mean it. Works super good. Reduced my acne in almost a day after use. No scent but I like that. Great packaging also I love the pump. The best cleaners for acne EVER!!,1,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,this product is ok like it is a cleanser but it isn't better than the foaming one. as someone with acne prone skin this did help a little but i would recommend the foaming one instead,5,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,The packaging on this bottle is clean and very organized. The scent is very clean and unscented. It is very affordable and really effective towards the skin. The ingredients are very natural.,1,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,"This cleanser has helped me a lot with my acne, it gets fast results without irritating or over drying my skin. It also absorbs a good amount of oil leaving my face feeling super smooth.",4.3,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,This product is very lightweight on the skin there is not scent to this product what do ever the packaging is not bulky so it no that had to have in a bag we're it is taking up space there is 2% salicylic acid for acne in this product the pricing is great on this product I have had this bottle for 5 months and it still has product and when u travel with this product it doesn't spill because u can turn the pump and it will lock,4,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,its helped with new breakout but keot my skin the exact same,1,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,"This is definitely a more gentle cleanser, I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and this cleanser doesn't irritate or dry my skin out at all.",5,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,"Terrible product, have been using it for 2 weeks now. My acne was healing but as soon as i started using this product my acne became worse. On top of that the cap was jammed so i have to open the whole bottle and pour out the contents. So much waste, and its really expensive here in africa.",5,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,"I have been having an issue with my skin lately where along my jaw and cheek im getting breakouts terribly. They hurt, theyre under the skin, they leave horrible dark marks. My skin has been going through it and i dont know why. Anywho i knew when nothing else worked i needed to go back to 2% salicylic acid. Thats been my best friend since i discovered it early in my 20's. It ALWAYS works to clear my face and its done it again. Its only been 4 days since getting this and my skin is looking so much better. No active breakouts right now, it dried all those up and will continue to help stop more from producing. I need to stick with products like these. Should have never doubted",4.3,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,"Really good! I like this product. I switched to it by accident, but was pleased. Very efficient for my problem, and economical. The price/quality ratio is ideal. Convenient packaging",4,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,"I bought this product hoping that it would help with some breakouts that I have been having. However, after just one use, my face was covered in small bumps, and it has now been three days and the bumps are still there. I'm honestly not sure what to do about it. I have heard about the idea of skin purging, but I am terrified to keep using the product based on these results after the first use. This product may work well for people with different skin texture and dryness level, but it just didn't work for me. I will definitely have to consult with a dermatologist before continuing with this product. I'd love to find a cleanser that works for me and controls breakouts. This one is just not it.",1,,
CeraVe Acne Control Gel,"CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser is a game-changer! As someone with oily, acne-prone skin, I've tried countless cleansers, but this one stands out. Its formula, enriched with salicylic acid and niacinamide, effectively targets breakouts without stripping the skin. It's gentle, non-drying, and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. Plus, it's fragrance-free, which is a big win for sensitive skin. Highly recommend for anyone battling acne!",5,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"This is so gentle on the eye area. This removes mascara so easily, even waterproof. I used another product for years and would have to wipe my eyes over and over to remove my mascara. This product only takes a few swipes and mascara is gone.",4.3,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"This is easy on the skin around the eyes and even more importantly easy on the eyes, no burning and no hard rubbing to remove my black eyeliner and mascara no eyelashes falling off, this is one of my new favs!!",5,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"I'm honestly so surprised this product has 4 stars. I'm a little bit of a review snob and never buy a product that has less than 4.5 stars, but I bought this on a whim without looking at reviews. I'm so glad I didn't look at reviews because this product is amazing and I have bought 2 bottles so far. I don't wear mascara often but when I do it's usually waterproof or drugstore L'Or√©al. It also works great for eyeliner and eyeshadow. There's 0 scent which I prefer. I put this product on a cotton ball and everything melts off super easy. The ONLY issue I have with it is that if it gets in your eye and you're not super careful, it will cloud your vision for a few minutes. When I use it really carefully I don't have any issues. I've tried so many eye make up removers and this one is by far the best. A little bit goes a long way too. I really wouldn't let these reviews deter you..it's worth trying for yourself! You may love it, I definitely do :)",3,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,I bought it for removing waterproof mascara and it doesn't at all,5,,

CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,I used this to remove my Fenty eyeliner and it wasn't able to remove anything. The scent is light if any at all. I did not care for the packaging due to the bottle didn't have a smaller hole for the product to come out. It kinda just dumps out. I love the child resistant lid though.,4.3,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"I don't like this product, ineffective, it will take a lot of time to remove makeup, after that my eyes are burn. Packaging is normal. Good scent. Good ingredients and money. But I would never buy it again.",5,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"Unfortunately, this is the worst eye makeup remover I've tried. It didn't take off my mascara which is not waterproof and it really bothered my eyes. It left a white film in my eyes after washing and stung. I had to sit under the sink running water over my eyes for a while to get the film off. I've never had this happen before and makes me leary to use it again.",3,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,I read that this eye makeup remover could help remove eye makeup if you're having and eczema flare up. This was not the case. It burns. Left my eyes super red and swollen. Not your typical cerave quality product.,2,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"I am 56. Best product I've ever used. My eye lashes were falling out with another product. I switched to this and BAM, lashes are back and it takes very little product to remove my eye makeup.",1,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"I love CeraVe and have used their products for 20 years; however, this product is a dud. While it doesn't irritate my eye like others have mentioned, it doesn't remove my mascara (which isn't even waterproof). Won't be purchasing or recommending this to anyone.",4.3,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"This garbage made my eyes sting like crazy and I couldn't see properly due to some weird film and grease in the formula. Plus it was ineffective, left half on the eye makeup on. Buy Clinique eye makeup remover instead, feels so much better and works 100 times more effectively.",5,,

CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"This is a terrible product. I'm really rating it a zero stars as giving it 1 is too many. I bought this yesterday and used it last night. It got in my eye, made my vision blurry for a few minutes and it stung. Right before going to bed, I noticed that same eye was red. Upon waking this morning, that same eye was really red, irritated and burned. I've been using drops all day trying to soothe it, but my eye remains irritated and continues to water. I hope it starts feeling better soon! I really don't know how this product has an average of 4.5 stars, because it's awful. I threw it in the trash.",1,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"I came here just to write this review. This stuff is terrible and I actually give it zero stars. I used it last night for the first time. I got it in my eye and caused my vision to be blurry for a couple of minutes. Before going to bed I noticed my eye was red. When I got up this morning, my eye was irritated, red and watery. My eye has been burning and irritated all day today. I've been using drops trying to soothe it. I hope it clears up soon. How does this product have so many stars???",1,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,I don't think it works much better than CeraVe micellar water and it costs a whole lot more (especially considering the quantity.),4.3,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,I found this eye makeup remover anything but comforting. It stung my eyes. It's also inconvenient to need to shake the bottle at every use. I have returned to a Neutrogena product.,5,,

CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,Did not work for my sensitive eye area. I have psoriasis and this product burned and I couldn't wash it off fast enough. All the other CeraVe products I have used have been great.,2,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"I wanted to love this product, but it didn't do it for me. It was too thin, and I felt like I had to rub really hard to get my makeup off. I think this product would be better with a gel consistency.",1,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,I do not wear mascara every day but it works well when I do. I prefer more of a cream but my regular brand has been discontinued and found this. Gentle and effective.,4.3,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,I am prone to getting eczema around my eyes when they get too dry or are exposed to a lot of irritants. Ive been using this product for months and love how well it removes my eye makeup and DOESNT cause an eczema flair. Would highly recommend,5,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"It has been a very long time since I used an eye makeup remover that has stung my eyes, but this really did, not just a bit, but a lot. It also made my vision cloudy and really didn't remove my eye makeup well (and I don't wear waterproof mascara). It's a shame since I like everything else I have tried from this brand.",3,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"This product is such an amazing makeup remover! I typically use Micellar water to try to get my makeup off, and it never took all my makeup off, or it would leave an oily residue on my face that I did not like. With this Cerave product, it does not leave and oily residue, and it does not feel heavy on my face! I have noticed improvements around my eyes using this product and would definitely would recommend this product! It gets all the makeup off without any harsh scrubbing and makes around your eyes soft, and smooth",4,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"I have been using Micellar water to take my eye makeup off, and I didn't like how it left an oily residue on my eyes and it often times didnt take all the makeup off. With this product it feels so lightweight on your face and doesnt leave an oily residue like the micellar water does! It also gets all the makeup off your eyes too! You also don't have to scrub harshly in order to get all the makeup off!",5,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"I was very excited to try this product as it's my first time using an eye makeup remover and its milky look and packaging caught my eye, but was very disappointed. Maybe I used too much but after soaking my lashes and then gently rubbing with my eyes closed, I opened my eye and I saw cloudy and got scared and started panicking! Thinking I was going blind I went to go wash my eye. The water helped. I was scared to try it again but I gave it a second chance with my other eye with a little less product. Still saw cloudy though and washed my eye again. Very scary and don't plan on using it again. I came to read the reviews and was shocked only one other person had this experience. However, I will say it did seem gentle on the skin. I'll just stick to their face washes and lotion üòÖ",4.3,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,I only wear mascara so I wanted something to take it off easily. This takes it off so we'll and doesn't make you lose any lashes. Gentle on your eyes as well!,5,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"Not sure how there is so many good reviews. This stuff is terrible. I must have put too much on my cotton round but it IMMEDIATELTY went into my eye and caused cloudy vision and irritation. I freaked out and started flushing my eye because I didn't know if this was normal. I used way less for the other eye and same thing. Irritating feeling in eye and around eyes and I didn't scrub. Not to mention it didn't just wipe my makeup off I still had to scrub. I also woke up the next morning with this white stringy left over gunk still in my eyes. Love their face wash, hate this. I'll stick to my curology makeup remover.",3,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"CereVa makes a lot of good products but this is not one of them. Liquid eye makeup remover is a terrible idea, always runs into eyes and doesn't do a thorough job. I have to discard this one.",1,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"this eye makeup remover does not remove eye makeup any better than water. i shook the product well, as instructed. even after scrubbing - hard! - still no trace of makeup on the towel. if you're used to neutrogena or one of the generic equivalents stick to that bc it actually works",5,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,Doesn't take off waterproof eyeliner very well.,4.3,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"This is the best eye makeup remover ever! I wear a lot of waterproof, long lasting makeup that is very difficult to remove without a lot of vigorous scrubbing and this stuff takes it off easily with a gentle swipe of two. I highly recommend this product.",5,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,Sad that I won't be using the cerave line anymore. I love the products but they're not cruelty-free.,3,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,Maybe I'm using it wrong but it makes your vision cloudy when trying to get eye makeup off. For that reason I would not purchase again. I think the ulta eye makeup remover works better,3,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,This stuff takes off all make up. Doesnt matter what masacara I use. Just don't get it in your eye as it is a bit irritating.,5,,
CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover,"I really like using CeraVe Comforting Eye Makeup Remover for removing eye makeup. The remover is in liquid form and I dab little bit on cotton ball and then wipe the eye makeup gently. I like the its unscented and doesn't irritate the eye area. This is an effective remover and removes the water-resistant mascara too. Moreover, its paraben free and colorant free. Its a must have in your makeup bag.",4.3,,

Will not rub in. Tried moisturing and even after an hour all it does is cake up and pill. Unfortunately wasted money on two bottles since it was buy one get one 40% off. At the time of purchase this had great reviews so I thought I must be doing something wrong .

I know most of the reviews are complaining about the white cast but i was able to mix in bronzing drops with mine and then apply makeup over it to solve that problem. What i couldnt get past was the SMELL! It smells so incredibly bad and the smell lingers. For a very long time. And God forbit u get some on your mouth and taste it! To me it smells like burning rubber. And hours later i will still get wiffs of the smell. Its really bad. I honestly thought I purchased a defective bottle because of how rancid the smell is, and is the only reason i came and looked at the reviews. It is an SPF 50 and mineral sunscreen so at least it has that going for it. Other than that, this product is a major flop from a company that imo has always put out good reliable affordable products. Very disappointing. Dont waste your money.",1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,It is mineral sunscreen. Fantastic one at that. The point of it is skin protection. Cute and blistered doesn't sound appealing to me. A little product goes a long way. Wipe your face before reapplying.,1,,

The white cast also makes your skin appear a pale, unnatural color.",4,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"This sunscreen is the worst i have ever tried. Turns you White as a ghost, doesnt absorb into skin, with really bad smell. Smells like tires.",2.6,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"It hydrates the skin, and also protects you from the sun. It has a lightweight feel and it's good for under makeup and things like that. I recommend.",5,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,I like this sunscreen because not only does it not leave me any white spot but also helps me protect from the sun while also leaving my skin moisturize.,1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"After reading and following the directions for applying CeraVe Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen, I was disappointed to find that a white residue was left where the product was applied. It also remained on the neckline of my swimsuit after being in the pool for 30 minutes. I have used other mineral based sunscreens with success (Blue Lizard). I thought I would try CeraVe sunscreen because I like some of their other products. This particular product was a disappointment and I would not recommend purchasing it.",1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"This is perhaps the worst sunscreen I have ever used. I rarely feel motivated to write reviews but this is just so unpleasant to use that I felt like I needed to. The company describes it as lightweight and non-greasy but it's more like the texture of the stuff you use to patch the holes in walls. Like wall putty, it is impossible to rub in. If you try to rub it in and hope it will blend under makeup, it won't. It stubbornly stays put and pills up if you try. The end result is that you've got a flakey, pilled, bright white mess all over your face. I am the whitest of the whites but this white cast turns me into a sickly Victorian child with some kind of skin disease. Unusable. I wish I were exaggerating.",5,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"Very disapointed. Love their body lotion but this is a no go. Way to thick. Does not go into skin. Ive got it all over my clothes, hats & sandals. I am returning this product.",2.6,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"Very disapointed. Love their body lotion but this is a no go. Way to thick. Does not go into skin. Ive got it all over my clothes, hats & sandals. I am returning this product.",5,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,Does not rub in smoothly across skin. Leaves a horrible white cast on me (and im very pale). Tracks onto anything. I have stains on my car seat from it.,1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,will not rub in! I looked like that guy from the movie Powder. Not exactly a look I want! I ended up having to wash it off!,1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"pros: not greasy, works very well cons: you will have the whitest tint on your skin until you literally scrub it off.",1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"Unlike most sunscreens, this doesn't really have a smell to it which I like. I also like the consistency of it, from my experience, it doesn't pill. One thing I dislike about this sunscreen is the fact that it stains the leather on my car, leaves this white stain if any part of me touches the leather, which sucks, but it does come off once cleaned‚Ä¶",2.6,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"So, like everyone else, I really disliked this sunscreen. It doesn't blend into your skin‚Äî it sits on top. You'll DEFINITELY look spooky. And it stinks. But here's the thing‚Äî I have literally never have spent a full day outside / on the water without getting burnt. I spent 10+ hrs ourside on the 4th of July and I got ZERO sun. This was with a wonky application, being in water, and tubing. I have vitiligo, so sun protection is of upmost importance to me‚Äî and this did the trick. Is it awful? Yeah. But it does what it is supposed to, and for that, I'll continue to use.",5,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,It did the job but i definitely recommend it for the beach rather than if you're going to an actual event cause the white cast will make you look silly!,1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,This sunscreen it super hard to spread and leaves you looking ghostly with a huge white cast all over your face/skin I tried it a couple of ways but it did not spread at all,4,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"I LOVE this sunscreen. I'll be outside for hours, reapplying, and I won't burn. BUT BUT BUT: as a pasty person, I look like I passed away with how white this makes my already white skin. I really wish it didn't have so much white cast as I love this sunscreen.",3,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"My review is so very similar to others. I would like to give a zero. I looked like a ghost. Almost impossible to remove. Won't use this again. Thought it would be a great product, as other CeraVe are.",2.6,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"Although I normally love Cerave products, I did not like the white cast that was left on my skin after using this product. The white cast actually made people question the health of my skin as my skin actually looked ashen and mottled in the sun. I will not purchase this product again.",5,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"I love so many Cerave products. Thus, I was shocked at how terrible this sunscreen is. It does not rub in AT ALL, and leaves the most horrendous white cast. I'm a pale girl I look spooky on my own, this managed to make me spookier. Save your money!",1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"I am begging CeraVe to please re- formulate this. I honestly will never buy this again until it does. For reference I am a pale, sensitive red skinned, blue eyes girl. I am used to having a little white cast which I understand comes with physical sunscreen, but what I got from CeraVe'a mineral sunscreen is unreal. The formula left a lot of white cast and didn't work almost at all. Everytime my skin touches something it leaves a sunscreen print. I can't imagine anyone of color can ever use this sunscreen. If you're reading this skip CeraVe mineral sunscreen results from it. I used CeraVe on my body and a different physical sunscreen on my face and had way better results on my face.",1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,This sunscreen has got to be the worst thing I've bought in a long time. Do you see how it looks like I rubbed dried out body paint on my arm? This shouldn't exist and no one should but it. Do better CeraVe.,2,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"This product has such a terrible white-cast i looked blue. For reference, i am incredibly pale. Dont buy this thinking youll avoid the white-cast - you wont.",2.6,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,DON'T BUY THIS. It doesn't absorb at all and you look like a clown.,5,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,goes on like white paint and doesn't absorb. get ready for it to rub off on all your clothes.,1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"This sunscreen does NOT rub in well. Whole family used it because a lot of us have eczema and we were fishing. No one got sun burned and my mother said her skin felt amazing. That being said, we all looked like ghosts. This sunscreen doesn't wash off well and it doesn't rub in or absorb ever. Don't suggest with makeup use or if you want to look nice, but it won't aggravate sensitive skin and it does work for sun protection. Personally, I'll probably keep looking for a better option.",1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,This will not blend into your skin at all. It is thick and stays white on top of skin no matter how much you blend (which isn't easy since this is thick) and no matter how much time has passed,1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"Well, I experienced what everyone else has with the white casting and it not rubbing in well. I applied it for the first time yesterday before going outdoors and it's still on my skin between every little nook, cranny and fine line or wrinkle on my body.",2.6,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,"Oh man‚Ä¶ as a skincare enthusiast, daily sunscreen wearer and Cerave loyalist, I REALLY wanted to love this sunscreen so much‚Ä¶ but it simply isn't great. I regularly wear mineral sunscreen, both alone and under makeup, so I am familiar with the idea of a ""white cast"" being apparent following the application of mineral UV filters on most skin tones. I am fortunate to have an ultra fair ""porcelain"" skin tone that is generally not impacted by this occurrence though. Of the eight (8) mineral UV lotions currently in my rotation, this is the only one that is obviously and LITERALLY leaves my face, neck and ears looking white and pasty once applied. No amount of rubbing, spreading or allowing time for this product to sit on the skin alleviates the obvious ""white cast"" issue. Wearing this over serum and moisturizer yields the same crusty result as wearing it on clean skin alone. Unlike other hydrating SPF 50 products at this price point, it is definitely not suitable for use as a makeup base or primer. Though this sunscreen does not meet my requirements for regular daily use, I can honestly say it DOES work well as a protective skincare product. This is the one I reach for on ""no makeup"" days when I am gardening and doing outdoor tasks during high UV times as well as those that require limited interaction with others. My skin never burns, does not become reactive, and always feels hydrated with no irritation after removing this sunscreen. If you are looking for a heavy duty sunscreen that provides skincare benefits and lasts in humid climates, this one works well. However, I can only recommend it in good faith with the knowledge it will not blend evenly or not be noticeable unless you are literally a ghost.",5,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,This is the worst sunscreen I've ever put on my body! It didn't dry it left me so white that I was transferring onto my clothes and my fianc√© was making fun of me calling me ghostie. It never dried I waited over 30 minutes and had to scrub it off of myself. I used the smallest amount I could and it wouldn't spread or rub in.,1,,
CeraVe Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50,I will be returning this product it's awful! It left me white and chalky and wouldn't rub in so I looked ridiculous. The only thing worse than the lack of spreading is the smell. I've never smelled so disgusting in my life. I don't even know how to describe the wretched odor it leaves on your body. The odor is also so hard to get out. The sunscreen also gets all over clothes even if you wait 30 minutes before dressing.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have been using this religiously for 2 months now after cleansing my face. I have had acne my entire life, until now.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I tried this out because it's raved about and was really excited to try. I usually have pretty smooth to the touch, but dry skin. It did give my skin a more brightened look and what felt like a ""firming"" feeling which was nice, but every morning after using it when I'd be washing my face, I noticed my skin felt textured all the sudden when it wasn't before. Especially on my forehead. This never broke me out in pimples/full on breakout but just texture/bumps that felt like they were under the skin. I would skip using it for for a night or two and my skin would calm down. I stopped using it at all and just recently tried again just to be 100% certain it doesn't work for me before giving away or throwing away, and the same thing - texture across my forehead & now jaw. I do love the brightening & overall feel of this product just isn't for me. I also do have slight shellfish & histamine allergy that I've seen some other people mention, which I think attributed.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,After I started using snail mucin in my skincare routine I noticed so many changes. I used to have very oily skin and breakouts constantly but i found that this product has helped a lot with that,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"despite the fact that this brand is kind of a relic, I still think that snail essence is still a bomb.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I'm a fair skinned Latina and have dry, pretty nontextured skin, sometimes combo skin when it's hot in the summer. Was so excited to try this, have seen so many tiktok and youtube channels rave about this, but everytime id use it, id end up with textured skin. Usually i can run my finger around my face and its soft/smooth but everytime after using this, the next day, id have what felt like teeny tiny bumps/uneven texture. It never broke me out into pimples or anything, and it did do a good job at ""firming"" the skin where it felt like the moisturizing propreties were doing their job correctly, but the feeling of textured bumps underneath the skin was enough to get me to stop using it. Since having stopped using it, my skins smooth again/no texture. Just writing a review to remind that not everything we see being raved about will work for your skin type necessarily.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I am on the spectrum and precise product output means a lot to me because, otherwise, I have to talk myself out of not freaking out. My beauty products need to have a pump or they need to be easy for me to evenly count. I think in numbers. Two pumps/applications works wonders! I love the even glassy look it provides. I love that it layers well with other products, regardless of brand or product type. Keep up the good work!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Wonderful,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I usually use this product at night. Its very hydrating and I love that for the nighttime. I like to add moisturizer on too of it after about 5-10 minutes to lock it in (not sure that really does anything but i like to think it does?). It also brightens my skin tone and makes it look firm.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've loved other COSRX products and heard great things about this syrum, but unfortunately, it caused hives on my face. After some research, I learned that people with shellfish allergies might react to snail mucin due to the similar proteins found in both species, which are often what trigger allergic reactions. These proteins are present in the mucin, so if you have seafood allergies, I recommend caution even though this product is advertised as hypoallergenic. It seems to work wonders for others, but it wasn't a match for me.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,holy moly i love this stuff. i have been using it for just over a month and i havent had a pimple since ive started! normally mosturizers feel wicked heavy on my skin and break me out but this makes my skin glow and absorbs so quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated!!,5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,the second i put this on my skin it felt inflamed and i broke out in little red dots and pimples. i was sad since so many people like it but after looking at reviews this is an uncommon reaction. i tired it a second time for good measure and had the same reaction,2,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This is the one product I was introduced to via K beauty creators and has stuck around in my routine years and years later. I will repurchase time and time again. I have sensitive skin and my skin type used to be acne prone and greasy and I used it then and now it is drier and clear (thanks to isotret) and I still use it! It never irritated my skin and always felt great. There is no scent too which is a plus.,5,,

It's super moisturizing and feels great. My skin tends to be a little sensative and this product has been amazing! I recommend it to everyone. It is a little slimmy but you get use to it. I use two pumps, sort of rub my hands together a little to disburse it and then I pat it on to my face; then I follow with moisurrizer.",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I do like the formula of this it glides very easily onto the skin, but also absorbs very well.

There's no fragrance. It sinks in quickly to my skin.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This product has really helped with my skin's oil production. I live in high humidity weather and am constantly searching for products to help with oil control. I use it in the am after my vitamin c serum and it layers beautifully. I use it some nights as well. I was skeptical when i first purchased but I can honestly say i noticed a diffence within 2 days of use. It is a little bit slimy but it absorbs well and a little goes a long way. It is well priced for the quantity and i cant wait to try other products in this line!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Listen, I do think this is an amazing product and definitely moisturized my skin, but I won't lie, I do think this product is overhyped. It didn't do as much as I thought it would. Overall, great product and would recommend for bumpy skin.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is a must use product. For anyone thay says its ""greasy"" or ""stick"" isnt apptlign it right.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I originally bought this product a year ago. Went through two bottles while I was upping my skinscare game. I had changed so much in such a short time that I was crediting my other products more, so I didnt rebuy. After a few months I just noticed my skin wasnt looking as good as it had been. I assumed it was becuase I was traveling, or stressed with work or whatever else. Then I was looking st my skin care thibking what can I do to bring like back to my skin, make it glowy, less textured again? Then I realized the only thing I had changed was not using this anymore. I repurchased bot even a week ago and can already see my best skin coming back. As someone who thought it was all hype I can honestly say it makes the biggest differnece and I will definitely keep rebuying",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This worked really well for me and would buy again.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I wanted to love it like evryone else but it did not do much for me. My skin did not have any reactions nor did it improve while use. This product did give a feel of hudration but quickly dried and then I felt the need to put on more mosturizer.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Really wanted to like this product after all the rave on Tiktok. Unfortunately, it broke me out with fungul acne under my skin. I dont have sensitive skin either. Although it does make the skin look moisturized, it did not work for me long term:(",2,,

It absorbs super quickly and perfect under my Clinique Moisture surge. I will probably use this product for the rest if my life. My face now feels hydrated, clear, and soft.",2,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I wanted to love this product so much! Yet I was surprisingly disappointed. I am someone who rarely gets breakouts and overall has pretty healthy clear skin. I began noticing breakouts within the week of utilizing this product. I was using it morning and night as a toner replacement. At first, I couldn't narrow down what product it was. So, I began doing some research and that is when I eliminated it from my routine and within three days, noticed that the breakouts began clearing up. This may be a better fit for someone who has extremely dry skin and is not acne prone by any means.",3,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"As someone who has struggled with makeup application due to a dry skin type, this product has been an absolute game changer.

Cant recommend it enough!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,After the first use you can definitely tell a big difference my face used to be beat up with acne and they're clearing up so fast!,5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Great product, however it is half the price Ulta charges with other online retailers. Do not waste your money buying it from here.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Hydrating but broke me out. There are way better products are there that won't clog your pores.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I love this product! It's worked so good for me! I love the texture of it and how smoothly it applies / feels onto my face and after being absorbed into the skin for a while it definitely brightens and makes my face shine like glass . So worth it!,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This product is amazing! I wasn't sure what to expect when I applied it to my face. I was amazed on how smooth it actually looked and it also had a plumbing effect and not to mention dewy as well. I will continue to purchase.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,My cousin and me both use a lot of different products from this brand. I love this product so much. I found that it's most effective if you wash ur face first then use this then do a serum and moistizer.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I bought one from ulta and the other from amazn. The ulta is less thick, and the amaz is thicker. I can feel the difference. The both absorb pretty well. Ulta is a tad bit more absorbing. Amazn absorbs well too. I really dont which one is the fake or genuine one. The difference is in viscosity, which i can tell.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I got one from ulta and the other from the biggest e-commerce in usa that begins with the letter A prime. I noticed that both are different. I don't know which one is real one. You can put in lubricant from KY, and I still don't know. They are pretty much same but with a slight dewy texture.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I guess i might be one of those strange cases of ppl allergic to this. I hear so much about it but it broke me out so bad,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I was really sad to see that this broke me out because of all the hype that i see and because i genuinly find this to be a nice product. Within a few hours the acne on my forehead reappeared and i started to break out there way more. I dont know if its just because i have combination skin where its more oily there but it didnt really work great.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This gave my face a bumpy texture and dulled my complexion. BUT, i have some small to medium sized patches of psoriasis on various sites around my body that this helps more than anything else I've tried, in some cases better even than rx steroid and d3 ointments (iykyk). I do maybe once/month use the rx ointment to boost, but seriously this stuff is unbelievable. BTW, I tried the peach slices version thinking the addition of cica derivatives would help, but it didn't, symptoms came back immediately so after 2 days switched back to this.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Listen girls the hype is real! At first I hated this because in the beginning it was breaking me out. I didn't use it for a while then I came back to it and it has completely changed my skin! It looks so dewy and moisturized where before I was really dry. I use this after washing and toning and I top it with my serum anf moisturizer. It's transformed my againg skin. I highly recommend. I also love the eye cream in this line. I'm 36 with sensitive, aging, dry, acne prone skin. It has helped with texture and wrinkles as well as firmness and pigmentation. I definitely recommend but give it time. I apply 3 pumps to my face and neck morning and night.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I recently added this to my skin care routine, I think it came as a sample in my last order. I just turned 60 and my skin has started looking older with fine lines and wrinkles as well as age spots. After about a week I noticed how much smoother and younger my skin looks. It takes just a small amount so a little goes a long way. I do use it under my eyes and haven't had any issues and it has helped with wrinkles/fine lines. I noticed that others were asking about that so I thought I'd mention it in my review. The price looks very reasonable so, when I get low, I WILL be buying this. Thank you for the sample, it pays to send them out as I will keep buying/using it in the future. You have a customer for life.",3,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"It was ok to use on my face., then I saw that it for my face. firmed. it But do not use on your butt",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Ive noticed my face is much brighter and has a more natural dewy look. I think it makes my skin breakout here and there. However i really like the difference its made in my skin so I will keep it in my routine.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I loved this I used to have little bumps on my face and forehead and after this andd the cerave face wash my skin in so clear and glowing I get compliments from people at school! Buy this now!!!!,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've started using this daily in concurrence with my cerave cleanser and the tower 28 sos spray and my skin is looking so much better! my acne is clearing up and my acne scars/dark spots are fading nicely. it's hydrating to my dry patches but doesn't make the rest of my skin super oily.,3,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've bought this product before & am going to buy again since I've used it on dark spots on my face & it definitely makes the dark spots fade away over time. Would definitely recommend this particular one!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I used it for a couple of days and after the first 2 days of using it day and night I noticed a plump glow to my skin appearance, on day 3 i woke up with acne above my lip and I assumed it was hormonal (in denial that this product was the problem) surely enough, I used it again (except only at night now) and my skin had a breakout the next day! It's unfortunate, but due to other's reviews I knew if I had fill blown acne attack, it'd be from this product, I also never break out this bad. I will be returning this.. I recommend using hylauronic acid if you want a cheaper product with similar benefits.. or do your research and find a snail mucin product that works for you.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This did so much more for my skin than I was even looking for. I have combo skin with very dry red skin that gets flaky and very oily nose and chin. I was looking for a moisturizer and after two uses this got rid of redness, and made cystic pimples with no white head just disappear. After the second use! After a week of use now the wrinkles around my eyes disappeared. I do use the moisturizer with this serum but do not put the moisturizer around my eyes so the serum took care of the wrinkles by itself.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"as a toner, it truly just gives nothing. its not as moisturizing as the serum. like i cannot give a great review because it just didnt do anything.",2,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This product is amazing! My skin is very oily but flaky and VERY prone to acne. This product did not cause any acne AT ALL. It really seems to soothe and hydrate my skin. I am very pleased with this product and have just purchased more items from their product line to try. Would highly recommend!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I use this about every other night and occasionally in the mornings and I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I had been interested in trying this product. It's light and refreshing. I haven't used it long enough to truly determine if I will experience better skin, but so far I'm enjoying it.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I love the way it feels on my skin,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I relaly like using this in the morning and evening. It leaves my skin feeling softer. Only con is the packaging, i find it difficult to control the amount I'm getting, but hopefully the full size has a better bottle. Will upfrade to the full size when im done with the travel!",4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I discover this product by searching thru reddit‚Ä¶ the comments weren't wrong. THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. Literally melts into your skin, so moisturing and smoothing. My skin tends to lean more on the drier side, especially after I cleanse my face. This product brought life back into my face. LOVE 10/10 good for sensitive skin as well",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I noticed results within the first week of using it. I've now been using it for a couple weeks now and only at night. My acne is gone and my acne scars have gotten lighter and NOTHING else has worked this well on the scars. My skin is more even and so soft. It is a miracle product which is shocking for the price!,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I usually wait a week before judging a skin care product I saw results in just 3 days!!!! My skin is much smoother and moistured . It has also helped my fade my healing acne on my face. It's worth the price!!!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Went through most of my first bottle and felt like it didn't do much so I stopped using it for a while. One day I picked it up again and realized it really does make a difference before applying moisturizer. Leaves my face shiny and helps with redness, it's very soothing. Just got my second bottle and I love the price.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is a very popular essence/serum and I decided to try it after I ran out of my last serum. Unfortunately it is not moisturizing enough for my dry skin + winter air/indoor heat. I kept the other parts of my twice a day skincare routine the same and only changed this step, but even after several months using this, my skin more often than not requires another layer of my face cream. I've also noticed cracking and peeling on my face that I haven't seen in a very long time. I'm sad that this doesn't work for me but happy I only tried it in this small container vs the full size. Maybe I'll have better luck in summertime with it.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Definitely adding this to my regimen! It's been healing the acne scars on my cheeks. I'm usually oily so I only use this once at night and before applying retinol.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,A little goes a long way! I will definitely keep this as part of my skincare routine.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have repurchased this product many times because I love it so much. This helps a lot with hydrating my skin, not so sure about fading dark spots, but the hydration factor is enough to make me repurchase. Also, I like that it doesn't have a scent.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have always had extremely oily acne prone skin with lots of acne scars. my acne scars are pretty much gone now and I've been using this less than a month. I've actually switched almost all my skin care to cosrx and my skin has never looked better!,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have been using snail products for years the amount you get, as well as the quality & easy to use bottle are all a win. Moisturizing without being greasy.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've used this product for about 2-3 years now and have always loved till I refilled this week and the quality of the product has seemed to go down hill. it no longer has a mucin like texture more of a cheap glycerin texture. Probably will be switching to a other brand since this one is no longer doing it purpose.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Leaves your skin looking so beautiful, dewy, and plum.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This worked swimmingly on my skin - it w went on easy and I saw results within a few days. HOWEVER, I also coincidentally started experiencing minor throat tightness and coughing during the time I started using the snail essence. I thought this was GERD, but it never cleared up. The only allergy I have is a severe one to dust mites. A Benadryl and discontinuation of the product has cleared up everything. I loved this product, and am SO BUMMED I can't use it.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"So pleased that i have gotten the basic line cleanser, toner, eye and moisturizer with the essence.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Listen. I've seen thie stuff recommended everywhere so I finally bought it. WOW. I love that it absorbs quickly and doesn't sit on the skin. My face feels so hydrated and plump after use! I honestly look forward to my skin care just so I can use this!,3,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This product has made my face super soft and hydrated but it does make my skin super shiny. I think I'd like the shiny look more when my skin clears up more. It has been helping with the texture of my skin which is a plus.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I loveeee this. Im on my 5th bottle. I love that you can use it daytime or nighttime and layer it over any actives to lock in moisture. It pairs really nicely with hyaluronic acid in particular and also retinol. It leaves your skin feeling and looking really smooth.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've been using this since early 2023 and I can honestly say that it's improved my skin a lot. It makes my skin softer and better moisturizerized. My skin doesn't get flaky as quickly as it used to. My smile lines aren't as noticeable. My skin looks bright and has a healthy glow to it. Whenever I stop using this for a few days my skin is noticeably worse than it is on days I do use it. Like, my skin gets flaky and dull looking and generally feels drier (this is the default state of my skin not a side effect of the serum). I wish I had an infinite supply of this serum. This serum is one of my holy grails.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I was skeptical about the effectiveness of the product but after finally using it consistently, day and night, before makeup and after washing my face, I can see a difference. I have dry and sometimes flaky skin, but this has kept my skin hydrated and so soft, even if I miss a day of using. This has become a staple in my skin routine!",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"okay so i had mid expectations going into this, and bought the travel size. but i just re bought the larger one because its so worth it!! i have noticed a difference on my skin and it cleared up, helping fade a bunch of acne scars and dark spots. i rarely break out unless its bc of stress or hormones bc of my full routine- adding this to it boosted that 100% i so reccomend. the only downside is its like.. goopy i guess but not in a bad way, it dries well and doesn't dry out my skin (i have very sensitive skin)",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Bought for the supposed positive effects on rosacea. This just does not agree with my facial skin ‚Äîdry, aging (mild rosacea t-zone)‚Äîleaves my pores more visible and accentuates fine lines, and texture, BUT it works wonders on dry & psoriasis patches, including ones that have not responded to other excellent, ceramide-filled products. Within 2 applications, the super dry patches on the back of my ears, were cured. Using it on other dry patches but nowhere else. To be sure, I have tried it layered over only mist and HA serum, and also under thick nighttime moisturizer and both ways it dulls and texturizes my skin. On it's own, it left my skin tight. On the plus, I do have dust allergies, but have not broken out.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I wanted to give this a shot after seeing how much people seem to love it, but it irritated my skin like none other. Put it on at night and woke up to puffy, red, sensitive skin. When I saw this I went and washed my face with my normal cleanser to get rid of any remnants of it and instantly my face looked and felt better. This was so peculiar to me as my skin is not sensitive and I typically do not have reactions to new skin care. I wish it would've worked!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,One of the best skin care products,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This product destroyed my skin. I had an allergic reaction causing my eyelids to swell and burn and itch. Caused a rash all over my face and neck. Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"The Cosrx Snail Mucin Power Essence has become my skincare holy grail! This essence has completely transformed my skin, leaving it hydrated, plump, and radiant. I was initially skeptical about using snail mucin in my skincare routine, but I'm so glad I gave it a try. This essence is incredibly lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin, providing deep hydration without any greasiness. I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture and elasticity of my skin since incorporating this product. It's helped fade acne scars and hyperpigmentation, giving me a more even complexion. Plus, it's gentle enough for my sensitive skin and hasn't caused any irritation. I can't recommend the Cosrx Snail Mucin Power Essence enough ‚Äì it's truly a game-changer!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,it not only helped repair my skin barrier but fades acne scars/hyperpigmentation!! the consistency can be off putting to some but definitely worth it.,1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,My face looks better,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I saw this being used in a youtube video about 3-4 years ago and i gave it a try and have never turned back! Its great for my dry skin, really evens out my texture. I always use this after my moisture sealant and then the rest of my steps. I have very dry skin and keep in mind, this is to help with anti-aging long term and is NOT a moisturizer. Just one pump is needed and lasts about 6-8 months!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,love it,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have had this products for over a months and have used it consistently while following steps on how to apply this ""correctly"" and I havent noticed that it does anything.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I was looking for something to help with moisture retention and decided to get this. It absorbs quickly and feels very light.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I don't think this is a bad product but it's not for me. Apparently the protein in snail mucin is very similar to the proteins found in dust mites and shellfish. Therefore, if you're allergic to one it's likely you're allergic to the other. I have a pretty significant dustmite allergy and didn't know about this connection and had a bad reaction.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This product caused red spots all over my face. Didn't want to give up on it so I tried it again a couple weeks later. Same thing. At least I got it half off so I wasn't out too much money. Bummer.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I used the whole bottle of this and I couldnt figure out why I was breaking out so bad. I chalked it up to being pregnant. After I ran out, I decided not to replace it and see how my skin would do. To my surprise, my skin started clearing up! Coincidence? Not sure but I wouldn't recommend if you have acne prone skin.",3,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I love this product it is very nourishing. the only thing is I have not seen a difference in my acne. i dont think it helps acne go away or prevents. But i still will repurchase!,1,,

It tends to be dry. I'm in my early 30s so blemishes happen but are not common for me. No matter what state my skin is in, I can apply this without it burning when other products fail. It protects my skin effectively, works great for dermaplaning, and I use it every day under a moisturizer. I have gone through a big bottle of it and just got another.",4.7,,

I absolutely love this product and will be sticking to it! it cleared my acne up so fast and makes my skin very soft!,5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This product made me breakout in painful cystic acne, do not recommend.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I read quite a few reviews prior to using this. I read some people had irritation immediately from using it. I decided to try it out for myself and hoped I wouldn't have a bad experience, since I've read so much about the benefits of snail mucin. Happy to say I've had no interactions and actually love this product so much! I'm 52 and suffer from skin that can become dry quickly. This has been so lovely in keeping my skin really supple. I use it at night and sometimes in the morning. It's not slimy; it feels really smooth/slick and it absorbs quickly. Really nice product!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,dont get if u have sensitive skin,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Yes, when I first started using it, I noticed some white heads cropping up. But I also have found this to be the case with barrier-building skin care, like byoma products/peptide creams, etc. And I have very sensitive skin. Once you adjust to it, this will make your skin softer than EVER. It's worth the adjustment I promise. I couldnt believe it was my skin when I touched it. Use before moisturizer and wake up with plump soft skin!",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Ok so i got it around 2 weeks ago and ive noticed SO MUCH CLOGGED PORES, at first i gaslit myself, but i just found new clogged pours and im gonna stop using it!",1,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I do not understand why this is viral. This was the worst ""moisturizer"" I have ever used. It made me breakout and the texture of my skin is so bad now. Do not buy!!!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I like it and it lasts for a ling time i had it for about 1 month or more! and its really tiny ! The inly thing i dont like about the mini one is that ir doesnt have the same texture of the regular-sized, its more liquidy rather than the nornal one but its more sticky. But a good product!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have been struggling with finding a product that fits my skin. I have blemishes around my chin area and underneath my nose. Ive tried multiple products and this is thr best one yet! Completely got rid of the blemishes and makes them go away. I am on my 4th bottle anf will NEVER stop using this!! Go get it!!,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I was excited to see if this lived up to the hype but it sadly did not. My mom uses it with no problem but it caused me severe breakouts. Little liquid filled super red ones and big puss ones I had to use pimplenpatches for. Its been a week since I used jf and im still a pizza face,4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Very hydrating, very good for acne, checks all the boxes of what it's supposed to do, a little does go a long way and im more than satisfied. Only things I would consider cons is i wouldnt put this on if you use a silicone/not water based (ex. camo matte concealer by elf) liquid(!) concealer or foundation all over your face because it would probably peel and mix. Powder stuff should be fine tho. Does smell weird too lol.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,snail mucin has been a savior for my skin i break out really bad and its has stopped and controlled it perfectly just recently ran out and im getting more saturday but i live by snail mucin and tell anyone and everyone i can about it highly recommend!:),4.7,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Every time I've tried to wear this under makeup it causes my foundation to become patchy. It repels the foundation. I tried it with different types. I can only wear it to bed at night.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Love this item,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I received a sample and was excited to try it after reading all the rave reviews, however, my skin did not agree with it at all. I used it 3 times in total, and each time I had little red spots all over my face along with red cheeks immediately after applying. It also made my skin super oily after an hour which rarely happens to me. I had to go home and wash my face, it looked and felt that bad. I'm sure this works great for some people but for whatever reason just not my skin. Reading the reviews it seems the product has given others the same reaction.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I love a interesting way to apply hyaluronic acid, and other moisturizing factors. It leaves my drier skin dewy, and well moisturized. Love this in the pm whenever I apply a lot of profucts.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I rly wanted to like this product but as someone who never gets pimples or redness. Some one who grew up on clear skin. I started getting pimples and redness literally after using this product. I wanted this to help for my dry skin and jt made jt worse. Lucky i got this product half off so i didnt spend full price,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"As everyone knows‚Ä¶ Tiktok made this viral! I was curious because Tiktok put me on with The Ordinary Niacinamide and Hylaronic Acid Serums. Surely, they couldnt do me wrong? Well.. they did! This broke me out like crazy. I used it for about 2 weeks and threw it away. It was so gross putting on the snail mucin and it was so thick my other products were barely getting absorbed. Now, you guys my agree or disagree with me. But all it did was break my out!",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Snail 96 really does work. I try new products and then ditch it after a couple of weeks. But my daughter, Ashlee said it dies work. She is so right! Snail 96 leaves my face so soft and plump.",4.7,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"At first I used it couple of times every week. I didn't saw any difference. So, I started using it daily and I started getting breakouts. I thought my skin was purging and will go away with time but it got worse. It ruined my face, I have acne scars all over my face.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Good Quality,1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This is by far the best product thus far for dry skin. After 3 nights if using i already feel a difference. My skin is plump and holds moisture. The first 2 nights a had a small breakout on my forehead but they went away. Just like with any product give it more than a night to see a difference. It feels like it tighten my skjn and reduces lines and winkles.,5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have reactive skin never had acne or any kind of skin condition other than bad reactions to certain ingredients.This stuff caused spotty patches and itchy hives and tiny bumps on my cheeks that had fluid oozing out.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Honestly I could only see this working for people with dry/normal skin, non-acne prone skin, or people who live in dryer cooler climates. But as someone with acneish prone, combination skin and live in a very hot humid area, this stuff gave me terrible fungal acne. It clogged my pores and since i really wanted to give it a try I used about 75% of the bottle and still saw no noticeable difference other than the acne. I also tried using it in different ways to see if it was just because of my application and still no difference. Everyones skin is different though but unfortunately didn't work for me.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,So excited to ckntinue seeing the benefits. This product has been amazing on my skin so far.,3,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I was expecting to see a glow on my skin. The product that i just received is very watery and just dries out in literally 5 seconds. I'm still trying to understand what type of skin it works on. Maybe it does not work for my dark tone.,5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I tried based on jaclyn h. Review and push to buy on her IG. The texture/feel doesnt bother me but it just doesnt work with my skin, since using it i started getting big cyst-like pimples and an itchy red rash on my neck (not hotmones Im in my 30s and havebt gitten true breakouts since i was 16.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"My pregnancy gave me incredibly dry skin - I had dry patches all over my cheeks and chin. After using this, I don't have to reapply my moisturizer after an hour or apply Vaseline. My skin remains and stay hydrated",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I always thought snail mucin was revolting, but I saw so many videos were people swear up & down it's the best thing. Not for me! I will admit that my skin at first looked very silky, like glass-skin, but after a few days I started having a rosacea reaction- pimples all over, and even developed closed comedones around my nose. I would stop for a few days & then try again - same thing. So if you have rosacea or sensitive skin, you might wanna skip this one.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I was warned that several if my friends who used it ended up being sensitive/allergic to it, but I tried it and have used it morning and night for the last week and I am a huge fan. I do use with the nyx marshmallow primer and yhe van man honey and tallow balm and my skin has never been better. My fine lines are reduced, my skin is brighter and more hydrated, and i have allover had less skin irritations and redness.",2,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I read about this product and waited awhile before trying considering it was snail mucin. I finally took the plunge about a month ago and I'm glad that I did. It isn't gross feeling like I thought. Very hydrating and has helped my skin look much better. I'm 62 and I have to say that I can't exactly put my finger on it but my skin looks fresher and glowing. I always use moisturizer and sunscreen after applying the essence. Just ordered another bottle. This will stay in my regimen.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I mean yea it makes your skin look plump & dewy but only until it dries. Them it's absolutely pointless tbh. Been using it for over a year waiting for somthing special to happen based on the hype but nope, just like sticky water.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"My dermatologist recommended that I try snail mucin for extra hydration for my dry, middle aged skin. I am not prone to acne and did not have any breakouts from this. I have an extensive skincare regimen and put this on after treatment serums but before moisturizer/night cream. It helps provide another layer of hydration. My skin has looked less flaky and more glowy since using this product. It is a bit slimy, but you get used to that. I use a pea-sized amount for my whole face and haven't noticed any scent at all from this product.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've been using this product for about a week now and it has completely changed the state of my skin. Dark spots and acne are GONE. not to mention it's a perfect base for beautiful glowy skin under makeup. i will be buying this again and again.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I used this product for three nights and I actually loved that my skin looked hydrated and felt moisturized each morning after. However, the morning after the third night, I noticed a cluster of skin colored bumps on my jawline. It was a reaction I have never had from a product before. (This was the only new product I was trying at the time as well) It went away within the next couple days after I stopped using the product. Really bummed because I did love how this made my skin look and feel.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Might help others but did not do anything to my face but make it irritated.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,so in love with this stuff!,1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Took me a month of fungal acne, cystic acne, and bad skin texture to realize this was the cause and not my hormones. Stopped using it and a week later my skin was completely different.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Wonderful product that has really helped my dry, sensitive skin stay hydrated. Highly recommend.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I HIGHLY suggest if you want to try this product to get the full size. If you just want a travel friendly version, i still would recommend the full size and a travel container that has a pump or is a squeezy tube. This mini wouldhave been perfect if not for the large hole you are supposed to pour the product from. It is highly wasteful especially with the consistency of the product itself.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,So soothing to the irritated skin. Very hydrating.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This was my first time trying the product due to the hype I had been seeing and I'm so happy I did! Combined with my other products my skin is looking good.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Ok so i was very worried about slimy stuff on my face. I have to say its not a gross slimy lol! I wasnt sure when to put it on. Literally everything says after toner. I did put it on after toner and then used my other stuff after. What i thought would take forever to absorb didnt. My skin sucked it up! Skin wasnt sticky or gross it felt very soft. I put on my normal stuff and it all went on so nice and my skin felt amazing after! Next morning my skin was so plump and soft. Im usually a little red and it wasnt there! I have lots of scaring from skin issues and that wasnt as red as it normally is. I will definitely update in a few more weeks!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Saw on tik tok and got influenced, but I love this snail muccin. I was hesitant at first because I do have sensitive skin, but after reading through the reviews it looks like you really just have to try the product to see if it works for your skin or not. It will either be a godsend or break you out it seems like",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I really wanted to like this since so many people reccomended it. Unfortunately it was too much for my skin. It BURNED when i put it on. I started getting red patches and breaking out everywhere. I heard snail mucin can be an irritant to some who have sensitive skin. This is definitley true. Overall it seems most people like this and I just don't have the right skin type for it. Dry, sensitive skin havers avoid this!!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I love this product so much everything abt it is great smell, hydrating, moisturizing. But the feeling and slimyish feeling is werid and known its snail mucin is funny üòÜ",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Love this product my skin has never felt so soft and I have had 0 new pimples. My scars are fading and my skin has never been better !!!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've used this for years but stopped recently maybe because my skin changed. I would recommend you keep this in a cool area or refrigerated! It helps with the texture because the texture is quite odd. This product has to dry before you can really do anything but overall it feels lile its helped the elasticity of my skin!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Caused a bunch of fungal acne on my jaw line area going up my cheeks!! Do bot use this its not as good as you think üò© i thiught i mt was good but it is not!!! Ruined my face !,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I seen a lot of people using this incorrectly. Which i made that mistake at first too. Acter using it correctly it has made a difference in the hydration if my face. Very moisturizing!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,if you have sensitive skin this is a big no. it will break you out. you will think its helping you until its not‚Ä¶ it took me awhile to write this review cause i wanted to get to the root of which product was suddenly breaking me out. and guess what??? this is the one. I am am an esthetician and have talked to multiple people that have used it and they are still getting breakouts to this day. its probably too late for me to return unfortunately. save your money and stick to the basics :/,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,You know the reviews where people say I've only been using this for three days but my acne scars are almost gone from this stuff‚Ä¶.dont believe that. This product can and will draw moisture into your skin if you put it on damp skin. So the plumping effect you get might make it seem like scars are disappearing. But its not 3 day scar disappearing miraculous. Now unfortunately I have super sensitive acne prone skin and this broke me out. I also gave it plenty of time in case it was a purge. But alas it wasnt. It just didnt work for me. So be cautious if you also have this skin type.,1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Granted ‚Äî I've only been using it for a few days now and will follow up with an update but I've had SO many breakouts since I using this serum and the face wash. I haven't had these many pimples in so long and was super excited to try it but.. maybe it isn't for me or my fellow oily girlies. Also, it accentuates my pores like CRAZY. Blegh. I will give it the 3 to 4 weeks so I can give it an actual chance. Praying for no more pimples and for my pores to not be visible from space. Also, if it's not for oily people then that's on me for not doing proper research!",1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I was using the snail mucin mask from Peach Slices, and I loved it so much I really wanted to incorporate snail mucin into my everyday routine. I heard a lot of good things about this product, so I gave it a shot because I was suffering from severely dehydrated skin and a massive breakout caused by an allergy. My skin was noticeably more plump, hydrated, and calm after just a single use. My inflammation and breakouts have minimized. Also, I really recommend patting this into the skin instead of rubbing it. I have found it absorbs much better that way (this goes for most products in general).",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"It caused little bumps all over my forehead. Although it makes my skin feel great and is oddly refreshing, it immediately caused my forehead to breakout. This was the only adjustment in my daily routine and I noticed it after day 2. It started with one small bump, next day i had like three, by day 5 i had 12 :( it gots to go unfortunately.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Not once in my life has my skin EVER looked as bad as it does now, I took my chance after seeing this all over tiktok most people saying its good but also others saying that this will make you breakout. My skin type is normal and I've NEVER had more than 3 pimples at one time , my skin is now textured and I've broken out all over, I don't know what to do this has never happened to me, I wish I never took the chance and got this product, within a week all this happened. I've had so many breakdowns because of this, it's really depressing and I'm really sad this happened , I've never felt so ugly and I wish I never got this product. DONT GET THIS YOU MIGHT REGRET IT.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Thin consistency, easily spreads, MUST HAVE A DAMP FACE WHILE PUTTING IT ON! It's a humectant so it draws moisture to it. But does not create moisture. Use a moisturizer after to seal it in and you will see the results. It doesn't break me out and it's soothing. Definitely recommend!",1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I highly recommend this product, there is a couple of fakes out there so please don't be mistaken. I also think a lot of people get this confused, but im not 100 precent sure as I am not an expert. But this product is much more effective for acne, rather then any other skin cancer ( as dry skin, oily skin, pores, etc.). But depending on your skin type it may be able to help in those ares to hydrate and soften your skin!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I usually don't leave reviews, but I had to for this product. I've been using this product for a few months, and I can notice a difference in my skin. I do suffer from acne, and I believe I have combo skin. I usually use 3 pumps on my face, and a couple on my neck. It has helped reduce the oiliness on my skin. This product helped so much with my acne/texture too. I didn't realize that I had a damaged skin barrier until I tried this product. It is very moisturizing, and it leaves my skin brighter and dewy. There have been times where I slacked on my skincare or skipped this product, and I could definitely notice a difference when I didn't use this product. My skin looks so much healthier with it, and I'm really happy I tried this product. I was hesitate at first because I heard this product might not work for you if you have issues with dust (it's related to the snail mucin ingredient). However, I would totally recommend it to anyone who is thinking about trying it! I will definitely be repurchasing this in the future!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I was experiencing really dry skin so I wanted to give the highly popular product a try. I used it for like 2 weeks, and was kind of amazed. My skin was hydrated, plumpy and looked youthful. One random night I had used it and started feeling itchy and breaking out in a rash. All over my face and neck. I was having an allergic reaction. Since it was the newest product I was using, I stopped using it. Everything went back to normal. Though, I was left with tiny little itchy red bumps on my forehead that come and go. I decided to give it another try 3 weeks later and the same thing happpend all over again. It might be good at first‚Ä¶ but watch out ü´£",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have been using since the end of august. So far its going well i havent seen much of a difference in my ance scars yet.

Im waiting some more to see the change acne scar and texture but you have to be consistent.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,love the product so easy to use 10/10,4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Ive been using this product a little less than a week and unfortunately I'm starting to breakout now and my skin is just as dry. For the first few days, I thought this product was a miracle, but my skin just doesn't seem to agree with it. For reference, I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin with pretty deep scarring.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I got this product a few days ago and have been applying it twice a day. It's all over TikTok as this holy grail for skin care, and I have to say I'm pretty impressed so far. I have dealt with really bad cystic acne that left my face pretty scarred, and I don't want to speak too soon but my scars seem to be going away and my face seems to be glowing. I use this product then use a moisturizer and I just go about my day! Also, this product is sticky, but is absorbed by the skin very quickly and does not leave a residue behind.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This has helped my acne and acne scars so much! I use this before any other product and it helps everything else absord into my skin so much better. It also cleared up any acne I had and helps fade my acne scars so much faster. The only thing about this product is that you cant use it on dry skin, I was and it broke me out at first until I learned to have my face wet before I apply it. Now it os great and I use it morning and night!!",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This snail slime is great. I like it. Always apply it on a damp face. It gives a natural shine to your face. It moisturizes it and even gives it a healing power.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I was on the fence about this product but saw so many reviews I had to try. I love my skin routine and any product that I can use to boost hydration, I am all for it. So, I thought that this would be good and it was.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I use the all-in-one cream religiously, so I purchased this to use in tandem with the cream. Honestly, I am unsure if there is any added benefits of using the essence. It is moisturizing and light when used on its own, however I do prefer the feel of the cream more for daily and nightly wear.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I used this snail essence for years without any issue. It helped clear my skin but this year I bought two bottles and immediately noticed the texture wasn't as goopy, I felt watered down but I used it anyway and immediately broke out the next time. Cosrx changed the formula! Ulta has the old ingredients listed Old: Snail Secretion Filtrate, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Arginine, Allantoin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Sodium Polyacrylate, Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol New: Snail Secretion Filtrate, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Carbomer, Panthenol, Arginine The new one is directly from Cosrx website. Please patch test on a small area of your face if you wanna try it but personally I recommend going with the Jumiso snail EX essence instead! I used to recommend this to everyone but not anymore.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This product really does give you a glass looking skin. I suffer from acne and redness and dry skin but this product changed that for me. It hydrated my skin while also helping with redness and breakouts,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I really wanted to love this product as u heard so many great things about it. But all it did was break out my skin.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I was skeptical when I bought this product a year ago, but it's clear that it's plumping my skin and sleep my complexion more hydrated. I'm sold on this product, even as I'm streamlining the number of skin treatment steps I do. It's a keeper.",1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Glowing skin everyone want,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Just bought this mini one on Saturday because TikTok made me LOL. Used it 3 times and ALL the congestion of my skin is GONE!!! I'm seeing the skin I used to have before I turned 30! I'm going to buy the big one and get more minis as gifts for family,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I wanted to love this‚Ä¶.. i tried using it faithfully for about 2 weeks but it doesn't absorb unless you only use this 1 product on your face. Its sticky and then sits on top of your face all day, not sure it's doing anything for my face. So many swear by it so I really tried. I really dont think this does anything deep in your skin at all, i dont think it penetrates down and i think it inhibits other products from working if you put anything on after this. I am a skin care fanatic, so i have used many products and this is not one that im going to continue to use or would recommend.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"who wouldve thought that snail secretions would be one of the best skincare trends, and for good reason. i saw results overnight after just one use, and i woke up to smooth, even, plump skin. i bought the mini bottle to give it a try and i will definitely be buying the full-size bottle once it runs out. the only downside i can see is well‚Ä¶ the origins of the product. i mean, putting slimy snail goop on your face isnt exactly appealing to most people, but thats on them and theyre totally missing out",3,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have pretty good skin naturally but its dryer and i get texture here and there so i wanted to try this because if all the reviews. It onky gave me more texture and my smile line is 10x more noticeable since i started using this. I used it correctly and applied to damp skin but i felt it did not hydrate, nor exfoliate. My skin was glowing before and after using this for a couple of weeks its dull and just does not look as good. I know it will work different for everyone but i think a lot of the hype over this is just trendy",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've had this bottle forever and it's helped dry, sensitive skin so much",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"this product is extremely hydrating and gives me a natural glow and soft feeling skin. however, if you are looking to treat acne with this product, it isn't a cure-all. i struggle with hormonal acne. after only a few days, i noticed that my bigger spots got smaller or went away, but i did notice more smaller spots/closed comedones come up. i use my snail mucin with benzoyl peroxide and glycolic acid. the snail mucin helps to combat how drying bp is. it doesn't completely clear skin, but definitely improves larger/painful/inflamed spots!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I put a lot into my skincare routine. As a result, I have pretty even skin, before using this product. I added this mucin to my regimen, and it kicked everything up 10 notches! My skin looks radiant. My mother thought I was wearing makeup after about 2 weeks of use, and I was not wearing any makeup at all. I have combination skin, with very few sensitivities. If you're like me, this will be a game changer for you.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,so this is a good product and it has zero pore cloggers!! stay away if you have fungal acne tho or if you have any kind if allergies toward snails. you can do a paych test on your wrist to see.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Do not use this if you get fungal acne!,4,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I wore this a few times wishing that it wasnt this product that caused little bumps on my skin. I have highly reactive skin. I also wore it on special occasians because I felt it made my skin look amazing. Although I didnt like how I needed days after for my skin to recover. It is very sticky although it absorbs on your skin you dont notice. I usually dab product on 5 points but cant with this one because the ""slime"" stretches lol and can get in eyes or on mouth. So watch out for that. Will have to return. I wonder if there is a less concentrated option of this product I can try for same glass skin effect.",2,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This essence serum I use to layer on my face after I exfoliate/wash and use FAB's or the Body Shop's vitamin C treatments. I then use the COSrx snail essence and finish with the PTR peptide 21 moisturizer. This has an amazing product to help keep my skin from drying. I use 1 to 2 pumps and that seems to be plenty for my face. I consider myself to have skin on the drier side as well as on the sensitive side so I would recommend this product to anyone who wants an extra moisture boost. It has a slight stickiness to it but it seems to meld well with moisturizer to then melt into your skin. Great product and at a very fair price in my opinion as well.,5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,My skin has been so dry since moving to Colorado 4 years ago. I have tried EVERYTHING under the sun. I've managed to get it under control using The Ordinary products but decided to incorporate this snail mucin. MY SKIN FEELS PHENOMENAL. My skin genuinely feels good after using this. I am not prone to breakouts so nothing like that for me but I have seen people say that it cause them to break out. I would highly recommend to anyone struggling with moisture retention.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I'd heard about this all of Tiktok and of course I had to check it out. I wanted to purchase a small size first to make sure it improved my skin.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"i just bought this product today and i am going to keep using it in hopes that the red itchy rash is just a result of a new product being used on my sensitive skin, but after using the snail mucin, my skin broke out in red, itchy rashes. i read about snail mucin online and found that people who have an allergy to dust mites might be allergic to snail mucin, so that might be why some people like me are breaking out. otherwise, the product itself is great. it doesn't feel slimy, it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft where it didn't break out, and you get a lot of product for how much it costs, which isn't much at all‚Äîit's very affordable. there is no noticable fragrance and it absorbs quickly. i'm hoping this works out for me, i've heard such great things online about the benefits of snail mucin. crossing my fingers that i'm not allergicü§û",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"If 0 stars were an option thats what this would get. Never in my life have I ever experienced this type of acne. Prefacing this by saying i didn't change any other steps in my longstanding skincare routine. As a result of using this for about a week i have developed fungal acne. Its painful, it's embarrassing, it doesnt respond to salycillic acid or benzoyle peroxide or other treatments. I am devastated. And on top of it i didnt find it to be that moisturizing, and i did use it on damp skin consistently and applied moisturizer on top as you're supposed to. In fact it made me overly dry and flaky. Again i applied it to damp skin!! I wish i was able to love and rave about this like everyone else because i was sooo excited to finally try it, but sadly no. For reference I have combo skin. My oily zones surprisingly were not the areas as drastically impacted by the fungal acne but rather my dry areas like my cheeks are covered in painful breakouts.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Only thing i dont like is that it leaves my face super sticky that sometimes i have to wash it off. other than that its very nice, hydrating, leaves my skin smooth and dewy.",4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've lost count of how many times I've repurchased this essence. I have a travel bottle that goes with me on trips and always have an extra on hand. I love the hydration it gives my skin and how quickly it dries down. The texture has never bothered me and I can't say I have ever noticed a smell. I use it day and night and it layers perfectly with my other products.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is the one product I've used for years without fail and will keep buying. So good for hydration! No scent, applies exactly like how you'd imagine snail mucin to work. I wear it before moisturizer morning and night.",4.7,,

Finally as a last resort, I layered on this essence with the LA Roche Posay Lipikar Balm moisturizer. Within a day, I started to see a difference and the pain and itching was going away. After a few days of regularly applying the two products, the rash is almost completely gone and isn't painful at all. (Note: I had used the La Roche product before, on its own and with other products. I really think the two together were the answer). Definitely recommend. Cannot recommend enough!",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"for months, i had been seeing this product on my fyp and finally caved in and bought it. i normally do research on any skin care products i am purchasing, as my skin can be sensitive and is prone to breakouts. most things i read about this item is that it causes purging, which most new products can do as your face needs to get used it. for the first month, my skin did fine with this product, then the second month it started to purge, and then afterwards it was fine, up until this past month, where every time i would use this product my face would burn and i would wake up with excessive dryness all over my face, especially around my nose. i usually don't get random breakouts, but i have been for the past 2 months, and the only new product in my routine is this (which i purchased 5 months ago), and i stopped using it for a few days and my skin magically cleared up. this is definitely a 50/50 product, and i don't believe i will be purchasing again. i really did want to love this with the shine it gave you, but after a few hours, your dry patches are back and your skin will be burning :,(",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I had accidentally over exfoliated my skin and I heard so many great things about this product that I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did!!! It really saved my skin. I apply this when my skin is damp after cleansing and once it kind of dries down, I apply a layer of moisturizer at night or sunscreen in the morning. This method helped repair my skin back after that disaster. This is a bit sticky to apply at first, though that goes away a few minutes after applying, and any excess I have on my hands, I just rub it into them! Makes my hands feel soft too.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I had accidentally over exfoliated my skin and I heard so many great things about this product that I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did!!! It really saved my skin. I apply this when my skin is damp after cleansing and once it kind of dries down, I apply a layer of moisturizer at night or sunscreen in the morning. This method helped repair my skin back after that disaster. This is a bit sticky to apply at first, though that goes away a few minutes after applying, and any excess I have on my hands, I just rub it into them! Makes my hands feel soft too.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I initially wasnt a fan of this product. It irritated my eyes and made me breakout, however i kept using it and now my skin loves it. I apply it when my face is still moist from cleansing and quickly apply moisturizer over it. It really does help hydrate my skin and I can tell when I dont use it before I apply makeup. I try to avoid the area around my eyes and use a really good eye cream to prevent irritation around my eyes. This product can feel sticky but I think applying it on damp skin prevents that and helps the skin absorb the product.",2,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I'm very glad I bought the small bottle because this broke me out bad. If you have sensitive skin beware,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is worth all the hype! I have acne-prone and combo/oily skin. I use it in my morning and night routine after cleansing and before serums. It's hydrating and lightweight, and not greasy or sticky. It gives my skin a natural glow. I think it also helped a lot with repairing my skin barrier damaged due to over-exfoliation. I share it with my sister and she said that it makes her break out, so she doesn't use it often. My skin did purge at the beginning but I don't experience it anymore.",2,,

Very normal skin type. Ive been hearing such rave reviews about this for a while now and gave it a try. I have been using this for about a week and a half and I have so many pimples now! Especially on my cheekbone area. This is the only thing ive changed in my routine. I will definitely not be using anymore or repurchasing.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I really enjoyed this product at first. felt very hydrating and nice under my other skincare products.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This is honestly best product I have ever gotten ! Has helped me so much with my dry skin over this winter. I'm still using now even though it's spring. I think it's great for year round. It drys nicely and feels great,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,10/10. My skin is very sensitive and not many products I can use without my skin having a bad reaction. I use this product after cleansing my face with orange kojic acid.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Love love the way my skin feels and looks it's amazing Love this,3,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I can not skip this step in my routine. The essence is PERFECT and clears up my skin better than any other essence I've used before. It doesn't smell like anything and it's great on my oily skin type. 100% worth ur money trust,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Used it on the regular for about 3 weeks. While it def tightens while wearing once you rinse it off there are no differences, changes or results-not to my skin anyway. Just another step I guess I can do without.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I am really excited about this product! I was using too many actives and my skin barrier was destroyed. I did lots of research about how to fix it and many people suggested snail mucin. After simplifying my routine, I apply it to damp skin after cleansing, then the rest of my serums followed by moisturizer and wow.. my skin looks so much better. Redness and bumps are gone, flakiness has disappeared, and my skin feels so soft and smooth. I'll update if that changes, but after 2 weeks I have had no reactions. I use it morning and night and love it! I will say what my dermatologist told me - this is like hyaluronic acid and is best applied to damp skin. If you apply to dry skin, it can have the opposite effect and pull moisture out of your skin, making it dull and flakey and irritated. APPLY TO DAMP SKIN FOR THE BENEFITS.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This product nothing for me. Tried for over two weeks and I didn't notice any difference. What I did notice is a day or two I was running behind and only used face wash my skin had a layer of peeling on it? Flaky translucent all over my face. Even though I had just washed my face. It was strange. Anyways I ended up returning because my skin felt more moisturized with my previous skin care routine of face wash, toner and moisturizer.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"i have combination/sensitive skin with rosacea and i'm absolutely in love with this product that it's ridiculous. i have to use this every single day. it's very soothing on the skin, lightweight, non-greasy, and smooths out texture. it gives you an amazing dewy and plump finish with your skin. i love using it under makeup. this and the power grip primer for makeup prep, your makeup will last 24 hours no problem!",3,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"So good, this is seriously amazing you have to be consistent but even after first use I fell in love helps my sensitive dry skin get an extra layer of moisture!!! I love it so much !",3,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I bought this because I am a die hard fan of the snail 25 cream. I would skip this product and just get the cream. The essence makes me breakout everytime I use it. I bought one for me one for my bf. It's works for him but not me (sensitive skin),4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I'm 30f with 18 years of acne and scarring that I am finally getting under control. I've found a great skincare routine focused on hydration and exfoliation. I switch up my essences a couple of days a week depending on my activity level and sun expose. My high hopes for this were JUST NOT met. In fact, I see the opposite happening of what it's supposed to do. My skin glows without using this, but it will almost instantly dull my skin, and cause my moisturizer to be soaked up like it's in the Mojave Desert. I don't see much a difference or added benefit to my already solid routine after two months of use. It might work for other skin types, but definitely not for me.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Leaves me looking plump and dewy. Really hydrates and smooths skin.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have sensitive skin but not necessary acne prone and on my 2nd use, I woke up with the worst breakout i've EVER gotten. Woke up with about 12 pimples over night, my skin is still recovering :( Im sure it just depends on skin type though, have heard great things from others!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Helped my skin so much!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This truly is an amazing product. I have sensitive acne prone skin and it did not sting or break me out! I have only used it twice and I feel I already see a slight difference. My face feels softer and looks softer too!,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,keeps my skin moisturized all day,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Don't think, just buy!!! I recently removed my BC and my skin started to react a little to its removal so I went through a rabbit hole on TikTok about products that would help. & this has been a staple in my skincare routine‚Ä¶my skin hasn't looked this amazing even when I was on BC!",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This slimy concoction helps control my breakouts and absorbs into the skin so fast and leaves you with great hydration. I love using this under my makeup because it makes my base look so smooth,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Using this along with the snail mucin all in one cream is the only skin care that's actually helped with my hormonal cystic acne. I've tried everything targeted for acne-prone skin and nothing has actually reduced the size, pain, and look of my acne like this before. Holy grail for my skin!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I love it,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've been having a lot of dry patches on my face lately and this really helped get rid of them. It really locks in the moisture into your skin and just helps it look more healthier!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've heard so many people rave about this product for months but, I've always been hesitate to try this because my skin is very sensitive to anything new. So i gave it at shot because snail mucin is an ingredient that works well with some skin types and not others. I sadly will ditch the small one and not will not be repurshasing it!",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,i've heard ENDLESS reviews about this product and i finally decided to purchase bc my skin needs a bit more hydration around this time of the year anyways. purchased it and used it on the same night as recommended and i woke up the next morning with whiteheads on my forehead (i never breakout on my forehead) and some all over my nose! i decided it was just a small reaction to the product and kept using it hoping my skin would adjust to it and to my surprise: it hasn't. it's caused me to breakout in places i never breakout in and it also gave me a small rash on my neck! safe to say i really hoped this product would work for me but it did the complete opposite and i will not be buying again.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Bought this product becuase of Pinterest and it might just be me but sometimes when I later it over other products like The Ordinary's niacinmide it seems to pill,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I really loved this essence, left my skin hydrated after using. I couldn't tell if this product specifically is helping cure my acne scars but I do notice an improvement since using :) but mainly it's really helped with the irritation in my skin from bleach/ water. I work in the service industry so applying the essence to my hands and forearms has helped so much in my routine. So I recommend it a lot it's really nice :)",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've been trying different skincare products trying to figure out what my skin likes. I have finally found something that works. I actually see a difference in my skin using snail mucin products. I use this essence with a snail mucin moisturizer every night. My skin seems to be smoother and plumper if that makes sense. I have oily skin, but this essence dont seem to be too heavy for my skin. If you use this product by itself it may seem tacky when you apply it. I'll only use this product at night because it does make you look dewy and since I have oily skin, I'm not trying to achieve the dewy look.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Literally my favorite product ever. I have such sensitive skin & rosacea & this has worked the best for me. When I first started getting into skincare I RUINED my skin barrier & I seen so much hype ab this product so I gave it a try & I will be using this forever it honestly helped my skin barrier so much I still needed other hydrating products but this was what I initially used alone & saw so much improvement it's so lightweight & gives me such a nice glow especially when I pair it with the all in one cream. 10/10 if you have sensitive skin or a broken skin barrier & need to hydrate it pair this with your moisturizer & you should be all good,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,My 3rd bottle empty! I recommend putting it on a damp face so your skin can better soak it up. Does not make your face oily too!,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,If I've been rough with my skin or am feeling extra sensitive this has really helped restore my skin barrier rapidly. Super hydrating but still absorbs into my skin to layer my other skincare products. Lasts a long time too depending on what other products you rotate.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,It's sticky and I'm not wearing this under makeup. I guess it's ok but I'm not repurchasing.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Would recommend. I personally would do my skin routine Ôøºand add this product the step before adding my moisturizer. The snail mucin cream works better. You will have a glow. This alone will leave your skin plump and moisturized. Not a shiny glass finish. Do not! Used too much or it will feel sticky.,1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Was influenced by the internet to buy this product. Found it very average. Tried it in multiple ways in my routine, and never noticed life changing results.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have combo skin & this gave me white heads all over my forehead and nose & I don't feel like it did much moisturizing,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"HOW DID I EVER LIVE WITHOUT THIS! Seriously, I have very dry acne-prone skin, and adding this in my morning skincare routine made my skin so much brighter, softer, and smoother (pro that it also makes my makeup look great) Will repurchase over & over!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I really, really wanted for love this :( I've heard amazing things but this product didn't do good with my skin. I don't have that sensitive of skin, and I'm not particularly acne prone but this really broke me out. I didn't have any irritation that would signal an allergy to the snail, so it's not that that's bothering me. I've been using this serum for about 2-3 weeks now and I tried to tough it out to see if my skin was just adjusting but I've had many stubborn and painful blind pimples that take forever to get rid of. I've also got the worst blackheads around my nose that barely budge even with salicylic acid.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've had a long trying journey with my face, this product after the first application left my skin looking dewy and soft that is saying a lot. I would recommend this product to others.",1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This essence is super hydrating. I love this stuff! I was pretty hesitant about this product many times but when I finally caved in and went ahead and purchased this, I immediately fell in love with it. I was having redness/itchiness all over my face when I purchased this product and it was all gone the next morning! It leaves my normally oily skin feeling soft and hydrated, but not greasy. It plumps my skin so nicely. It is tacky initially, but dries without feeling sticky on my skin. I will most definitely keep purchasing this!",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have very sensitive skin that is easily reactive to a lot of ingredients. I also have eczema, so my skin barrier is weaker than I'd like. This essence works really well on my skin! It has a strange sticky stringy look when you put your hand to it and lift it off, but it's not sticky once on. I had a few tiny whiteheads the first two days of using it but haven't had anymore since. I think this is strengthening my skin barrier because my skin looks thicker and is less easily inflamed. The only thing I wish is that it felt immediately soothing and moisturizing on the face.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"If you have oily/acne prone skin don't buy this. I started breaking out after 1 use. I was breaking out in areas I don't breakout w/ different types of zits than I usually get. The second I stopped using it, the acne went away.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"When I tell you I've been singing the praises of this product, loud and clear!!! I've heard of this particular product, seen one of my favorite YouTuber use it and found it at work. I brought the mini and was hooked. The texture of my skin improved so much with just one use. I'm not new to snail mucin at all, a lot of my sheet masks contain it but to use it straight is a whole new experience. It has no weird smell but it is slimy. It gives you glass skin and helps with diminishing dark spots. If you have fine lines and wrinkles, it helps with those as well. I never not buy and use this product. But with any product, make sure to do a spot check for allergic reactions and things. It's not for everyone but if you can use it, I highly recommend it.",1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"(For reference I have combo + sensitive skin) Seemed to be hydrating at first, but on day 2 of using I had a break out. Like others have said it works for others but not for me.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have sensitive skin. After using this product, my skin became super hot, red, itchy. Immediately washed it off but it almost burned my skin. It took a week to recover from that burnt redness. It looked like sunburn. Not for sensitive skin. May works better on other skin types.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I wanted to love this essence so bad. It has minimal ingredients so you would think this wouldn't irritate the skin in any way, but I was wrong. My face was covered in little red bumps after every time I used this :( my advice were to be careful using this if you have sensitive skin and test it on the skin first",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Was looking for something to combat dryness from a new acne treatment and this is perfect. Absorbs easily, has no fragrance, and restored my moisture barrier. I apply at night under moisturizer and my skin has never felt better.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,My skin is so dry because it's winter in Chicago and this saved it. Honestly I think the price is great. Most serums you get only 1oz and that lasts me a month but this is 3oz and lasts so much longer,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"With oily skin that feels dehydrated from too many exfoliants, I assumed this would boost hydration and it simply doesn't boost hydration as I thought it would. And I realized it's an essence, which is meant to improve OTHER hydrating ingredients. For this reason I plan on getting the snail cream instead to be used with this essence because on its own it's not very hydrating for dehydrated skin.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I can speak to and absolutely vouch for the first 3 claims on the product description image. This is the only toner/ essence that has been able to completely calm my skin from an acute allergic reaction - even my tower 28 spray that I love for day to day skin calming couldn't do the job that this did for me. I only have a sulhwasoo and a Heimish moisturizer that also completely deescalates my reactive episodes like this snail essence has now proven to be able to do every time. (The most comparable texture and result is from the Galactomyces 95 essence, but this is much more viscous and immediately calming whereas that's been ideal for day to day skin maintenance for me). I have dry sensitive and repeatedly inflamed reactive skin that is currently experiencing repeat burning allergic reactions due to a bad reaction to heavy fragrance in a product I used a month ago. Beautiful viscous gel like plush liquid that doesn't have the smell or slime you might be scared of if the snail cream texture didn't work for you. Even with this being the thickest essence I've used, it spreads really easily and as it plushly coats the skin in a lovely thick layer of hydration, it doesn't feel suffocating or slimy at all. This is a perfect product for someone with a highly minimalist routine goal as you definitely can have this be the only step between cleansing and moisturizer and SPF. For the fact this is really easy to use without the trouble of the runny slimy formula of the cream, this is great to use in a pinch (even if it's just until you can get your hands on the new packaging version of the snail cream), so I'm definitely keeping this in hand to save me on travels from more prolonged skin disasters.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This stuff is incredible! My hyperpigmentation is fading and I'm not getting any new blemishes because of how hydrated and calm my skin is now. I have tried so many moisturizers and they break me out so quickly even if they say non-comedogenic, but this hydrates my skin and makes it feel so smooth",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have been using this for years now and have repurchased multiple times. I love that it is unscented and has no essential oils and I have never experienced any sensitivity from this, but rather have found that it helps to repair and maintain my skin barrier. I love applying this when my skin is damp as it makes it even easier to massage into my skin, and I normally use one pump, maybe two if I feel like I really need some extra TLC for my skin. Call me crazy but I actually like the texture of the product; it's kind-of a thicker consistency but I have found it to blend into my skin well and have not had issues with it pilling up. I use it both morning and night and will continue to repurchase.",4,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"i LOVE this product and i'm so happy it's getting the hype because it truly deserves it. i've seen some reviews about how it causes breakouts, but i wish people would realize that's normal when starting a new product because your face is just on its purging cycle. this product has done wonders for my skin and i've only had it for about 2 weeks. the only down side is how slimy it is. i guess because it's a ""snail"" mucin essence product that it makes sense so it's definitely a personal opinion rather than the product being annoying. i really would recommend this product to anyways with DRY skin as it brings moisture into your face. and if your skin so happens to break out, read the product and directions on when and how to apply!",2,,

Eventually I saw a dermatologist and they as prescribed oral steroids that got rid of it in a couple weeks‚Ä¶ but I feel like my skin is still more sensitive and prone to hives than it was before.

I have a really good skin care routine that works well the rest of the year but winter usually requires an extra product or two to help boost hydration and this works wonderfully!

I use one pump to cover my whole face and a second on my neck, twice daily. The size is quite economical and I only have to repurchase once or twice per year, so despite the price skyrocketing in recent years I'm alright with that.

I have heard so many great reviews for the is product and how it's helped so many other faces with acne, hyperpigmentation, redness, pretty much everything. So I thought why not switch it up. I've been using this for a month now and I do feel like my skin looks more plump and supple. I won't say that it has made my dark spots go away but I feel like my skin does appear to be brighter and healthier looking. My skin is on the oilier side, So I was a tad nervous since I've seen this is more sticky in consistency. However, this has not made me look any shinier and if anything gives me a healthy glow. I do have some active acne on my cheeks and neck at the moment, so I can't say that this helps to really remedy my breakouts. Overall, I like this product a lot.

I tend to get black heads a lot even when using things like salicylic acid and etc. The best I can say is to moisturize to prevent excess oil.

I hate when my bangs get oily and with this in a minute or so it's good to go!",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Love the product. I use it twice a day. And it helps hydrate my skin. I noticed smoother skin within a week. And my skin looked glossy.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I really enjoy this product- I've been using it for a few months and I would 100% buy again. I have super sensitive skin so I'm glad to find something that doesn't burn my skin. I use it typically day and night and I don't think it's transformed my skin- I still have redness and the occasional breakout but I think it's helped with my overall dryness. I know this product has been super hyped on TikTok/insta and I agree but I wouldn't say it's going to change your skin over night.,4.7,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have gone thru 2 bottles and let me tell you that this worksssss. I have struggled with sensitive skin and always had problems looking for a product that would not irritate my skin and this is the holy grail . Many people may have experienced irritation or breakout due to not properly using it, I recommend using it on slightly damp skin and also applying a nice moisturizer on top to keep in that moisture. I would not recommend this to really oily folks or people that have lots of active acne because of the moisture but overall great!!!!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I absolutely love this product. I noticed a bit of brightening over time and it keeps my skin hydrated. recently I started using this on my hair after a shower when it's wet. this has got to be better than any hair oil I've used. my hair looks sooo shiny and healthy! The hyluronic acid keeps my hair hydrated and frizz free while the snail mucin adds shine. I then lock the moisture in with a hair wax. totally recommend!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,so freakin good even using it one time the next day my skin was GLOWING literally RUN to buy this,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Not a bad product, it has a nice consistency and it was very affordable, but it, unfortunately, ended up irritating my skin. Within a week, my skin was burning and it got very red and blotchy. I also feel like this product did the opposite of what it was supposed to do and dried my skin out. Not sure if the culprit was the snail mucin or the hyaluronic acid, but whatever the case, it just didn't work for me.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I love this product so so much. I use it religiously morning and night and have seen my skin become so much better overall. My skin is more hydrated, less red, and I think less oily as well. If you're wondering if the price is worth it, absolutely yes! It's more than I usually pay on a serum type product, but it lasts forever even when I'm using in generously. I would and do recommend this product ALL the time and will continue repurchasing.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I really believe this product helps clear my acne.

The only thing changed in my routine was leaving out this snail mucin! So I rebought and yup, I think it totally does help with my acne. But I'd like to say I don't have a lot of acne in the first place, just a few pimples here and there every so often. My skin also isn't sensitive. I think this is hydrating too. I put it on right after I cleanse, while my face is still damp and then I put my moisturizer on. Love this product!!",4.7,,

I use no more than 4 pumps for my face, so it lasted me a while. It's easily spreadable so don't use too much. This is better, more long lasting and hydrating than the ordinary hyaluronic serum.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have only been using it for a week and I can already see and feel a difference. This product makes my skin feel so hydrated and I've noticed a more even complexion. I completely love this product!,2,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I don't have sensitive or acne prone skin, and this broke me out. I wanted to love this and tried it multiple times, I rarely get pimples but when I used this I got a few large painful pimples on my chin and cheeks. It does feel very hydrating, but the breakouts aren't worth it",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have pretty sensitive acne prone skin and this product only ended up clogging my pores. At first it seemed to absorb into my skin very nice and leave it nice and hydrated, but ended up just leaving my skin with more texture and blemishes.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"If you have a weak stomach or gag reflex this product is not for you. I couldn't get past the fact that it's snail slime. On top of that, the product is incredibly gooey and stretchy which makes it even more disgusting. I put some into the palm of my hands to apply to my face and it stretched and clung like children's slime. It was just too much for me and too sticky.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I use this under my face primer and my makeup stays perfect throughout the day. It seems like the tacky texture held my makeup onto my oily face, without feeling greasy. I also put it on at night, let it dry down for 10minutes, then apply Bare Minerals Ageless Phyto-Retinol Face Cream (I also do this on the mornings that I don't wear makeup) I've used other Essence's before and they've made me break out. (I'm 50 and still acne-prone) but this essence doesn't break me out at all. I'll be repurchasing, but it'll be a while, one small pump goes a long way.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is honestly another amazing snail mucin formula from cosRX and I will be purchasing again BUT it's not for every routine. If you already use their other snail products, it's kind of useless as the other mucin products are already packed with mucin. If you're using the other products it's redundant and I would skip out on this one. I will say though, that through skin changes I've found this is a perfect replacement or alternative to Hyaluronic acid serums. When I first started using this I was already using the snail mucin moisturizer, but I just started transitioning (ftm) and my skin changed from super sensitive and dry to greasy and acne prone but not as sensitive. The snail mucin moisturizer (which I've been swearing by for a year now) just doesn't work for my skin anymore, its sad but it happens when your body changes, not the products fault. So I switched back to an old fave from the ordinary (HA factors) which works for my skin better now than it used to, but I still needed some kind of moisture boost but as the ordinary moisturizer already has hyaluronic acid I didn't want to also use an HA serum as too much HA can cause irritation in the long run. This essence is a perfect substitute for HA serums! I find it even better than HA serums and I've used like 5 different HA serums at this point. So if you need an extra moisture boost in your routine without it being too heavy, have an allergy or sensitivity to HA, or just want to try out snail mucin products, this is a great product! Bottom line: it's not for every routine, but if it makes sense in yours, its great! It does exactly what my snail mucin moisturizer did and gives the same effect! (Glowy skin, longer lasting hydration, minimized fine lines, doesn't clog pores at all). It's basically just a powerful moister boost in your routine, but a really good one. (Product is honestly 5 stars but just because it's not really worth it for most people's routines I took a star off)",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"i've repurchased this and plan to again because no other serums have ever treated my skin so well! i used the ordinary hyaluronic acid for a while which was okay but it never lasted well and left my skin feeling like it needed more, but i never get that with this! i like the texture a lot and it makes my skin feel so smooth and soft, i feel glowing whenever i use this and it's 100% sensitive skin approved",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This hands down saved my life! I have the most complicated skin. First it's dry then it's too oily.. I started using products that broke under my eye on my cheek bones out into red irritation. This product brought me back to life.. I'll forever repurchase.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This product transformed my skin into beautiful healthy glowing skin. I wish i would've known about this product earlier !!!,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I loved the texture and its hydration, but I should've listened. It broke me out in whiteheads and I unfortunately had to return.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is well worth the price. I have very sensitive, reactive skin (to sunlight, harsh chemicals, temperature changes, you name it--my skin, like me, is very particular and doesn't like change). This helps keep my skin calm. I think I've repurchased this three times. If I am having issues with my skin because of environmental changes or overdoing it with another skin care product, I pare down what I use, but this always stays in my routine. The slimy texture might get some people, but it kind of fascinating to me. It has no scent I can detect, and I am extremely sensitive to smells. If all I had time for at the end of the day was washing my face and applying two products: they would be the Snail mucin and my moisturizer. It only takes a little so one container lasts a long time.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I use the product twice a day!! In the morning & at night. You only need a little bit! A little goes a long way!,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I was skeptical about something I heard about on social media. But the price and reviews convinced me to try it. I'm so glad I did. I've tried so many skincare products but nothing has made my skin glow like this has. I have very dry skin and am usually looking dry and dull by the end of the day but with this I look fresh and dewy all day.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I was very hesitant about buying this especially for the fact that it's snail mucin. having very dry rosacea skin I have to be careful of what I apply on it. After using this with the water toner it absolutely makes my skin feel wonderful. It really helps my dry skin. My face looks less red and it so smooth now. It looks brighter which is amazing since it's been so dull looking for so long. I have waited at least a month before posting my review because I wouldn't want anybody to put something on the face that would irritate them. but this has made a drastic change on my face and has definitely improved it. if you have dry skin, rosacea, eczema, Etc you really need to give this a try.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,got this because it was raved about but its average. nice but average and honestly it's probably because I don't really need it because I don't have skin concerns.I just enjoy skincare and this just wasn't mind blowing. not hydrating enough and kinda sticky. don't like using it but it's not bad,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"okay so, this has saved my skin so much it isnt funny, it really helped clear my skin and calm down breakouts. its really nice and gentle. i have super dry skin and this has helped much",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I use it before my moisturizer in the morning and evening and my skin looks so good! It's very hydrating and makes my skin look nourished and healthy. A little of it goes a long way.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I was getting the little travel sizes with the sample box which was amazing. It went out of stock for a while so now I just get big size. Love after moisturizer, liquid collagen :)",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Ooooeeee ‚Ä¶ this has become a holy grail item for me. The snail mucin alongside the sodium hyaluronate works wonders to smooth and protect. But y'all ‚Ä¶ Y'ALL! You have to use it correctly or it's a dud. I don't understand why more manufacturers of HA-based products (sodium hyaluronate in this case) don't stress that it MUST be layered under something occlusive. And while we're on that topic, if you're using oils either as a cleanser or something you think is moisturizing your skin, if the oil comes before another product, the oil is preventing its benefits from penetrating your skin. Since oils have larger molecules, they sit on top and penetrate less effectively than moisturizers with smaller molecules, like serums and cream-based moisturizers. SO that little lesson is the caveat with this product. Layer it in the right order without any oil in the game beforehand, at least. Rinse any oil residue off your face, then layer it either on clean skin or over a thinner product, like toner and/or a vitamin C active during the day, then put something occlusive over it ‚Äî a serum or a moisturizer. If you're dead-set on an oil, it must come at the very end of your routine or you're hijacking literally every other item in your arsenal. Back to this product: This order allows the ingredients to do with they're supposed to do, which is pull water to the surface of the skin and keep it there and smooth the skin with the properties of snail mucin. That's the plumping effect. If you don't lock it in, those water-searching molecules in HA (sodium hyaluronate here) are going to go looking for water in the air, which can create a drying effect (known as transepidermal water loss). Is it sticky for a couple beats? Yes. But give it a minute or two and it's dry enough so that your next layer(s) of serum and/or moisturizer won't turn to gravy and will offer a nice canvas for either makeup or pillow time. I use this product during the day and at night. BTW, I have combo skin and I'm 50. Skincare is more than a hobby for me.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have combo skin and I would break out randomly with huge almost cystic break out that would hurt. I started using this at night and my barrier began to heal and my skin has never been this clear and hydrated. I will never stop using this life saver!!,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Reminders me of drunk elephants hydration serum, B-hydra/protini serum. Way cheaper.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I really love this product since it keeps my skin smooth and plump. You do need to add a moisturizer after applying since it isn't an occlusive. It does cause breakouts in my T-zone, but elsewhere it works wonders. I have purchased this product and a similar one, but this one works best.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I use this twice a day (morning and night) before my moisturizer and toner. I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I definitely see a difference when I put it on. My skin looks dewy and healthy. It helps hold/seal moisture in my skin.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Wow! Honestly this product is absolutely wonderful for hydration. I wear a good amount of makeup so I cleanse really well at night and it leaves my skin feeling soooo dry. This helps SO much, I can really tell a difference in my skin. Only thing I would say is the products that I put on after this product kinda sit weird on top of it, but once I really press them into the skin it's not too big of a deal.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've been using this for years and my skin thanks me everytime. So hydrating and definitely makes a difference in my texture and glow.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"My face felt so plump and hydrated after adding this to my regimen last night, but 24hrs later my face is covered in itchy little bumps all over. I'm pretty bummed since the all-in-one cream version doesn't give me any trouble and my skin isn't really sensitive‚Ä¶ I guess I'll just stick with the cream and get a refund on the essence. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've been using this for a long time now, and I totally love it. I have got to be on at least my fourth bottle by this point, but it's hard to say because it lasts a really long time. I'm mid-30s, fair with dry skin, previously prone to blemishes but not anymore! I've found a great routine for my skin and this snail mucin essence is a staple in that routine. It's hydrating, soothing, and is such great prep for follow on steps. The difference this makes for me is huge. I apply 3 pumps to my hands, then gently press into my whole face and neck including under eye area after cleansing and toning. Follow with serum, facial oil (Loli plum elixir!) and moisturizer. If it's really, really, horribly dry skin time for me, I might replace this essence with my heavy-lifter in the hydration department, my Kitao water essence, which ULTA sadly no longer carries. But I'd say that a good 300+ days out of the year, this is the perfect essence for me. Highly recommend!",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I use exactly as directed it makes my skin feel soft however after it drys your skin is dry and needs a moisturizer on top of it. I do not see much of an improvement but it has only been three weeks,3,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Thought it was too hyped up at first but decided to give it a shot when it was half off during a beauty event. My skin looks so much better after this product. My texture isn't completely gone but it has gone down a lot.

I had read some reviews about this and thought I could stomach it, and I was SO wrong. It was a mental struggle to actually get that stuff on my face. Short term, I have no complaints. It does what it says and the stretchiness of the product made me feel extra protected. However, within three days, I noticed a couple blackheads on my forehead. And I never get blackheads.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Friends, get yourself some of this! My bff recommended this product to me in 2020 but I didn't get it until recently and started using as part of my morning routine after toner. I suffer from adult acne plus maskne scarring. I noticed smoother texture after 2 weeks of using. My husband, however, asked me if I had foundation on because my skin was so even! Does not clear up acne or claim to do that, but has brought down scarring, hyperpigmentation and helped to even skin tone. Highly recommend",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Clogged my pores and cause me to breakout. Purchased because my friends skin looked amazing. Will gladly pass it over to her.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I moved recently to a dryer climate, and this saved my skin. It kept my face from peeling with dead, dry flakes. Other than that, it isn't anything special. I just use it after a Cream Toner to trap the moisture.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This essence is amazing! It leaves the skin so hydrated and plump. I use it morning and night after cleansing and it melts right into the skin. This will definitely be a staple in my skincare routine from now on.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I really really wanted to love this I tried it 3 separate times and every time I broke out in little tiny white heads all over my face in places I never get acne. like ALL OVER My skin is kind of sensitive to fragrances and stuff like that so idk if that's what it is, but I cannot use this product without breaking out.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I did enjoy it for a short time because it helped with my dry skin but sadly it caused a bad reaction. I would still recommend people try it but start off with a sample size if you can if not try to catch a sale.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I was worried when I originally read the reviews about how it made some people break out but I havent had any issues. It is a very slimy texture so if that doesnt sound appealing to you then this isnt for you. I do think this helped my skin appear more glowy and healthy. I love the results it gives me and switch off between this and another essence every other day.,5,,

For me, I was able to ease into it by mixing in a few drops of hyaluronic acid, adding less and less until I was using the snail mucin only. Now that I'm used to it, it is easily the most nourishing serum in my arsenal. Helps with overall hydration and I swear it helps subsequent layers soak in better. Love.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Leaves my skin so dewy and hydrated. Definitely recommend if you have dry skin.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I love CosRx products and use them regularly. I was excited to try this and really gave it a good trial. I didn't just break out - I had severe giant whiteheads that gathered all around my nose. I extracted them, and it smelled like death!! (I'm not one to sniff pimple goo, but they were literally around my whole nose. So obviously I'm allergic to something, had a bad reaction. Tried again, stayed far away from my tzone and concentrated on my cheekbones. BAM! Giant painful whiteheads that smelled like death! I have only had an allergic reaction like this once other than the snail mucin. I'm sad, this works so well for others, but a big no for my skin.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Absolutely change my skin texture to a glowing, smooth look. I just couldn't believe it",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"i saw this stuff all over tiktok and was a little skeptical, but i tried it and love it. i have combination skin, on the oily side, and i use this day and night after my serums. i think my overall skin health has improved after a few months of using this. it doesn't make my skin feel sticky and it's very moisturizing",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I really love this stuff been using it for about 6+ months I really like it. I have combo skin and it's very hydrating and makes my skin feel plump. I use in the morning and night before I go to bed.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Like a lot of the other reviews that were low, I broke out in hives after using it for 4 days. The first two days I saw some pimples and I was like ""huh maybe cus it's something new"". My head, forehead, and hands were getting itchy but I hadn't seen anything and didn't think much. Now that I woke up, I'm covered in hives, it's so itchy had to slab hydrocortisone and take allergy medicine lol Apart from that, it does feel very nice when you first apply it, skin feels velvety afterwards. Too bad I'm allergic :(",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This has been a staple in my routine for months. I use it twice a day when I am at home and sometimes when I travel. It is hydrating and soothing. I apply two pumps to damp skin and it sinks in very well. It has a lot of play time and a lovely texture. My skin always looks slightly airbrushed after I use it, since it is both soothing and hydrating, quickly improving minor irritation.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"GUYS. Let me tell you about my skin- I live in the Midwest where we experience 50+ mph cold winter winds one day and a heat index of 90 the next. My skin is always windburned and has been sunburned pretty bad in the past, so my skin type is combination/dry and very dehydrated. It's super sensitive (most products burn) and crazy acne prone. I have fine lines and deep, and I'm only 36, but my skin age is roughly 55. I've tried high-end expensive moisturizers, serums and oils as well as budget-friendly drugstore options and NOTHING WORKED until I found this! I achieved glass skin in one use! It plumped my skin, added an insane amount of hydration and I swear I look like I'm in my twenties now! Just this essence alone replaced most of my serums. I had nearly a 10 step skin care routine that didn't do much of anything, and now I'm down to 3 because of this. Add in a hyaluronic acid water gel moisturizer and a nice lightweight oil and OMG üëèüèª ENJOY üëèüèª YOUR üëèüèª NEW üëèüèª FACE!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Wanted to love it, didnt care much for how slimy it is, I'm familiar with snail mucin! but Jesus I wish i had listened to people about this breaking some people out. I'm not even sure what cause it !! disappointed because now i feel like I'm missing on the hype of it.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"So I was really skeptical about this stuff. I mean who would willingly put snail snot on their face, right? Well, for the past few years I've had dry skin, like crypt keeper dry. Nothing was working. I stumbled on an article about this stuff and figured I'd give it a try. Oh wow, y'all! It really works! My skin feels so smooth! The trick is to put it under your moisturizer, twice day. Fair warning though: it looks gross when you open it, but really and truly worth it!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've been struggling with dry patches for the past 3 months and this has been the only thing to heal my skin! I am actually so impressed. I was starting to feel hopeless about my skin recovering and I've tried multiple different things and wow! This literally has cleared it up within a couple of days. Loveeee this,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This product feels like heaven on your skin. It's hydrating and smoothing and completely changed my skin. My holy grail product,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I like to use this before retinol at night because I have dry skin and with retinol it makes it even dryer. The combo is perfect. I loooooove ‚ù§Ô∏è,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I'm not sure what all the hype is about but did nothing for me. Nothing. Not hydrating, did not fade wrinkles, dark spots, isn't hydrating, didn't help with inflammation just fell short of anything but a shiny face if that's your thing. It's a TT hyped up product",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This has completely changed my skin! I recommend this for anyone with dry and/or acne prone skin. Using it with a moisturizer gives a dewy look without feeling greasy.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Amazing. Will repurchase until the end of time,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is the best skincare product I ever tried. It's hydrating, soothing and anti inflammatory. For me personally, it helps to prevent breakouts. Texture is slightly gloopy, but it absorbs into the skin quickly. Wears beautifully under makeup. This is a holy grail and I will always use it.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"At first this feels very soothing and hydrating, but it's just too heavy and really clogs my skin. I had the same issue with the peach slices snail toner even though it's much lighter than this one. HOWEVER, the peach slices snail MASK is amazing for me. I think my skin just doesn't like snail mucin sitting on it for a long time. If this also breaks you out maybe try using it like a mask for better results.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I use this after a hyaluronic serum, and feel that it really locks in the moisture for my skin! It does have a gooey consistency but that does not bother me. No scent. I would recommend because it has helped with my dry skin, and with my redness. I bought this to test if I wanted the full size...which I did buy! I will use this one for travel now.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I lovvvve this stuff. I got a mini travel size to try it out before I bought the bigger size and I love it! It goes on so smoothly under makeup or during a night time routine.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Nice, lightweight and soaks in well. Wears well under makeup too.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Got this based off reviews from a couple different sites. I always use an essence in my routine and this is by far my favorite! Other essences just felt like something to put on before my serums, no benefits. But with THIS?! I can feel and see the benefits, even after 2 days of using. I bought my mom a bottle too and she fell in love and has recommended it to all her friends (her and her friends are 60+). It obviously won't work amazing for everyone depending on your skin type. But with free returns to Ulta, why not give it a try?",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I never want to be without this stuff. It works alone, under moisturizer, I even mix it with sunscreen in my hand before applying to my face sometimes. I'm 52, everyone forgets that and thinks I'm in my 30's. Not just from this product, obviously, but I use this every single day. As a bonus, this can be used as a micro current serum with my NuFace Trinity device! I have sensitive skin, so every other option for the NuFace (except their expensive one) irritates me. Aloe turns my skin bright red! This snail serum is my skin's best friend.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have sensitive dry skin & I noticed when I subbed this as my moisturizer my skin would be extra dry but when I put a cream/lotion moisturizer underneath it would help lock in the moisture‚Ä¶ because if ur skin is dry it's going to lock in the dryness .From experience I would recommend using this as the ""slugging"" trend",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,All the positive reviews explain itself. This is amazing for soothing and deeply hydrating skin,1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have dry and sensitive skin and this makes my skin feel calm and hydrated.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I totally love this! My skin did break out a little bit, but that's probably because it was trying to get used to it. It's helped reduce my acne scars and helped with my active acne",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I know everyone is different but I broke out in hives from it. I waited a few days and tried it again and accidentally got it on my lips and they swelled until they split. I read something about a correlation between dust mites and this stuff? Not sure but staying away from snails from now on :) great price for so much product though!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,No words. Just start using it,2,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"i live in a very humid climate and THIS!!! super hydrating on my skin. i started using it after i broke out using a different product and idk what it did, but all i know is that this gave my face another chance. i started seeing a lot of improvements on my skin; my skin looked more plumped and glowy, healed my skin barrier, and hydrates my oily face without making me look more oily. ugh i just love this product please love yourself and get this. i got one for my mom (she has dry skin) and it's awesome. i feel like this could work on any skin types.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I bought this product during the 21 Days of Beauty event. I have very acne prone skin, and I was a little nervous by some of the reviews, but I'd used snail mucin before and hadn't noticed any major breakouts, so I proceeded with usage. After a few days, I broke out in small hives + acne all over my face and neck. After halting use, they began to go away. I'm not sure if my face is particularly sensitive or if the product reacted with my normal skincare routine, but either way my test patch on my arm didn't react this way. My mother tried the product and it works great for her skin. A couple of the reviews have said that if you're allergic to dust then don't go for this product, but I'd say if you have seasonal allergies than don't go for it either, or if you do, just be careful. I don't think this is any fault of the product, as people have had wonderful experiences with the product, but it definitely didn't work for me.",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I wanted to love this because of all the reviews of people swearing by this product but it broke me out every time I used it. After every application a new pimple would grow on my face. Super disappointing ):,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have tried SO many products over the years to help soothe my very sensitive, red, combination skin. I am prone to acne when my skin barrier is compromised! I have experimented with different active ingredients the past year and my skin has become very sensitive and sometimes nothing can soothe the redness and irritation. Like not even vanicream or the most simple ingredient products. I struggle with my skin barrier and constantly am in ""repair"" mode. This essence was a GAME CHANGER for me. It did not irritate my skin, cause any redness, and no breakouts!! It's so rare for me to find a product like this! I apply it after washing my face and prior to any other serums and moisturizer. I have consistently seen a big difference in my skin since using this. It is more hydrated, soft, less irritated, less red, and just looks beautiful and clear. Absolutely worth every penny and you get a large amount for the price! A little goes a long way. I am literally so happy I found this product. Highly recommend for those with skin like mine!!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I bought this spontaneously before a long winter trip and doubted it would last me for the three months I needed. A little goes such (!!) a long way and this tiny bottle would last a couple months of continuous use! I have very dry skin so I apply the essence before a heavy moisturizer and it feels like my face just took a big glass of water. Plus there's less fine lines on my face that are caused by dehydration.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Great product. I use it every day,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I use this AM and PM because it provides that extra hydration I need to make my skin supple and glowy. Continue using this daily for amazing results to make your skin look and feel healthier!,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I use this in AM and PM before moisturizer and it looks and feels hydrating at first I thought it's slimy but once I got over it I love it! looks shinny and feels great!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Love this stuff, it's so hydrating, feels sticky at first but soaks right into skin. I use it before a HA and let it soak into my skin before moisturizer. 10/10 and great ingredient list!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,makes my skin feel hydrated and glowing.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I use it twice a day,AM and PM routine,I am very impressed with this product.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've been repurchasing this essence for the past 5 yrs. I have dry, acne prone and sensitive skin....the works =( It really helps hydrate my skin and doesn't aggravate it when it's inflamed. It also gradually lightens my acne scars and my overall skin seems brighter the next day.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I use this gem of a product in between my toner and moisturizer. Sometimes I'll think to myself that it doesn't do much...and I'll skip this step, but I think that it does is it adds that moisture barrier that our skin needs. I can't think too much about the snail aspect of it, cause then it freaks me out -- but I love this product through and through.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,My skin has never felt so smooth and looked so plumped. Absolutely amazing.,1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"When I first used it, the texture was a bit shocking but once I got used to the feel of the lotion I love it. It really makes me feel like my skin is soft and glowing.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Fix your skin barrier. I saw that as a daily deal and bought TWO. First couple days of using it my skin was THRIVING! It was moisturized and MY OILY. My skin felt dewy and my 31-year-old face was giving LIFEEEE. TOO BAD, the dewiness later led to OIL. My skin was shiny and greasy. I did switch to a new face wash so maybe that's the culprit? I am not sure, but I stopped using it twice a day and skipped it altogether this morning. I hope I didn't waste my money or maybe this is just for use during the cold months? Not sure, but oily skin isn't my thing.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,i have been using this day and night for at least 3 months and i swear my skin has never been better - i have sensitive skin that breaks out anytime i add anything new to my routine and this has not irritated it one bit!,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've been buying this product for over 3 years now and it has yet let me down.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have bought this essence now 2 times, and for me it is well worth the price. The essence is moisturizing and it gives a long lasting glow. For me, I like to mix it with another essence to help decrease the time it takes to dry down. If you like having a glow, check out this essence, if possible try to get a sample of this.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Noticed immediate results with skin smoothing and less inflamed skin!!!,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I bought it after reading all the reviews raving about the product, if you have sensitive skin stay away from this product",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This product has helped my skin so much in the little time that I have been using it along with the cream. At first I was scared because many products don't work well with my skin but this one helped me so much. Some things don't work for everyone , but if you desire more moisture along with a lightweight feeling this product is perfect. If you have oily skin this product is a good moisturizer that won't make your skin feel heavy. It made my skin soft and even. The smell isn't noticeable to me and the consistency is perfect. This might not work for everyone but it works for me",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I tried it for two weeks and caused a ton of whiteheads. I found it a waste of money.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"love it, my skin is looking better than ever c:",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Love this product. I let this sit for 30 secs and apply a heavy moisturizer to lock everything in. So good!,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Okay so I tried the mini version of this and my skin looked amazing and so hydrated at first. But then I started developing tiny little white bumps on my chin. So I read other people's reviews and apparently some people had the same problem. I'm like 99% sure it was this product (there is a chance it could be something else though.) I have oily/combination/acne prone skin and I needed a good moisturizer because my skin was getting dry from retinol and this definitely helped that. I just wish it didn't give me these little bumps!!! They don't hurt and they're not super noticeable but they bother me.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Everyone's skin is DIFFERENT so definitely try it out atleast! I bought this on a whim and have been loving it! I have sensitive acne prone skin and this did not break me out:) I love how hydrated it makes my skin and my akin has never been better. Highly recommend,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I really wanted to love this since I had heard such great things about this product and I just blind bought it really. If feels amazing on the skin and left my skin feeling super velvety and moisturized BUT a day later I had hives all over my face. I thought it was a one off experience and really wanted to give this product the benefit of the doubt and used it a second day and the rash/ hives persisted. Within 24 hours of returning it my skin calmed down to how it was before. Very sad about this because the feeling was amazing but not worth the hives (personally).,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I bought this elsewhere and was so excited to try it because of my aging dry skin, I'm not really sensitive to much but this .. YES .. i have allergies to dust , dander and a few other things so like another Reviewer said ‚Äî Do your research.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I never tried snail mucin before, but heard about the potential benefits it has for skin. I started with trying the snail mucin face cream and absolutely love it, so I thought I'd give this a go. I thought it was a face spray when I ordered it, so I was disappointed at first when I got it and realized it wasn't. BUT boy, am I glad I discovered this! My skin is improved a ton, smoother, softer, hydrated and my chin acne has cleared. I love these products!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"this is beyond the best essence i have ever tried. i have combination, acne prone and sensitive skin. after only 3 days of using it my textured skin was softer, smoother and more radiant. it cleared up my acne and helps with hydration. a pro tip is to use before applying makeup because it has an amazing grip that helps your face makeup last all day long!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I got this and the all in one cream in the travel size as a gift, and I love them! I don't use it everyday, I just use it maybe a few times a week (usually before bed) and I wake up with an amazing glow! My skin is very normal and does not break out easily (knock on wood).. so I love the glow it gives me. The lotion does seem a bit dry on my skin at times, so I'll usually just top with another face lotion and I haven't had an issue with it. This product is sticky when you apply and when it dries, but moisturizing afterwards will help! 10/10 recommend!",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Caused tiny bumps and itchy skin. When you have a massive variety of products that are more sustainable, cruelty free and allergen free why even bother using this? Learned my mistake the hard way.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I received the moisturizer to sample as complimentary, but I bought this essence after using the moisturizer. The 2 products together are amazing. I've read if you have an allergy to dust, it could break you out in hives so please do your research and sample it before using it on your face but these products have left my face GLOWING! My face has never looked more healthier and has never been softer! These products are new staples in my skin care routine! Next I want to try the eye serum! I can't wait!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Have been using for literally 2 years. I put it on right before my moisturizer, makes me feel extra moisturized!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I wanted to love this. I heard some many asian skincare reviewers swear about this product. It didn't do anything to my skin really. I don't know if I was using it wrong. I used this after my toner & before my serums. I bought this around October 2021 & until this point, I don't see/feel anything different to my skin. I'll still give snail mu",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I use this every day and night paired with the corsx cleanser. This stuff makes my skin retain my moisture so much better! I apply it at night right after my retinol then let it soak in then moisturize. Definitely a new staple in my skincare routine. This product made me go out and buy another snail mucin product from Peach Slices,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I swear by this stuff. So hydrating and soothing!,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"coming from someone who struggles with acne and oily skin, i've found this product a must-have! i started using it during the summer and even with the climate change, my skin does really well with this! i also use it before hyaluronic acid and using the cosrx birch sap moisturizer :)",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"adding this to my routine has hydrated my skin, helped with texture, and i could not be happier. i definitely will repurchase again, and again, and again!!!!",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Very hydrating and calms down my skin. I just hate that I'm racially profiled when I'm in the store. The security guard ALWAYS follows me around, and they aren't discreet about it.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"A customer for life, this is the true glow.",1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,i got this after seeing it a lot online and i really like it for my skin. i put this on every morning and night and skin has been a lot more soft and hydrated. i'm also on tret and use this before applying it and it's helped my skin from flaking and peeling,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I hand the intention of buying this when it restocked because of the rave reviews. So, I patch tested it in store and within 2 minutes my entire hand was covered in painful hives! Not itching but actual pain. This was very strange to me because I have never had a reaction to any skincare product like that, let alone on my hand. PLEASE do your research and patch test before purchasing this! I heard if you have a dust allergy, this can cause a lot of issues.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"So many reviews have said that the product is sticky and takes 20+ minutes to sink in. Having used snail mucin before, I know this to be true and was looking for a more affordable snail mucin than what I had previously. It's typically great for dry/dehydrated skin and despite being acne prone, snail mucin actually brightens my face. HOWEVER, I don't think I got an authentic product, because this not only hasn't done anything for my skin in over a month but the texture is so watery and evaporates SO fast (in seconds). I arranged to have this curbside pick-up from Ulta, so I didn't realize that the outer box was smashed until I got home. Thinking it was unusual, I overlooked it and started using the essence since the bottle was full. I should have made the return! Now I'm stuck with a product that was probably half used, topped up with water, then returned. If the essence isn't tacky and visibly sticky/stretchy, it's probably not authentic so be warned!",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This product is that girl! I mean, the very first time I put it on my housemate noticed the glow in my skin. If you have dull dry skin like me, pleaseeee try this one out!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I saw this all of tik tok and decided to buy the mini version before committing to the full size, and I'm glad I did. I noticed after a few days of using it, i was getting tiny bumps under my skin on my forehead. After doing more research I found out if you have a dust allergy snail mucin can cause you to break out into itchy bumps. I stopped using the product and the bumps were gone after a few days. I wanted to love but it just didn't work with my skin :(",1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've been using it for years, looove it",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I was so excited to try this product because of all of the positive things I have heard, but honestly wasn't that impressed. I feel like this did nothing to benefit my skin, wasn't moisturizing, and the texture was not great. This product was so sticky and took forever to absorb into the skin. I would rather save my money and use The Ordinary's Hyaluronic Acid serum instead (and actually see results).",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Use this after using Jordan Harper's Barefaced Glow Peel Pads and my skin has never been smoother or glowier. I've never written a review but if you are thinking about this, definitely go with it!",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I absolutely LOVE this product! After two weeks of regular use (both AM and PM), I've seen a moderate reduction in fine lines around my eyes and mouth, and a DRASTIC reduction in my facial redness. Now that my complexion is smooth, even and no longer blotchy, I've tossed out my medium coverage foundation and started using a tinted moisturizer instead. After I'm finished cleansing, I'll apply toner, then immediately follow up with snail mucin while my skin is still damp, to lock in the residual moisture. Fair warning though; this product is extremely viscous, and it does feel a little like applying snot to your face... but I promise, the results are worth it. It's difficult to find a skincare product that's effective, reasonably priced and lives up to it's hype online, but this one undoubtedly does all 3 of those things. Highly recommend.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I had really high hopes for this product since it's so raved about online, unfortunately it broke me out really bad and also felt extremely stuck on my face. I wish it would've worked for me like it does for a lot of other people but I see I'm not alone with it causing break outs.",3,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"The people that are saying this is awful probably aren't using it correctly, or could simply be that it isn't for your skin. You need to throughly wash your face, gently pay face BUT KEEP IT VERY DAMP STILL!!! And then while it is damp use maybe 3-4 pumps and spread it on your face. After spreading it all over face, push it into your skin by gently pressing your face everywhere until it is almost dry. Then I wait 5 mins to put a good amount of moisturizer on and after a few weeks the results are amazing. I have dehydrated, acne prone, oily skin and it helped so much repairing my skin barrier. It's so hydrated without being greasy, smooth, and minimal breakouts. It's a life saver and I'll never stop using it, and that says a lot because I've never found a product I would use religiously even after spending probably thousands of dollars on skin care products.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I notice no difference after using for a couple months. Does not minimize fine lines like people claim. Hyaluronic acid works better for me in retaining moisture and plumping the skin. I'll be using the rest of the bottle since it's expensive and I can no longer return. I had such high hopes for this. Looking through reviews it seems like they must have changed the product, probably to save money and maximize profits. Who knows",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I am a huge fan of CosRx products, they're all I use on my skin. I wanted to try this since I've heard great things, but this one was not for me. Its definitely hydrating and made my skin look nice but it broke me out with white heads on my chin. I didn't notice this until I stopped using it and my breakouts went away quickly.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have dry sensitive skin and after using this today my skin has become very red and hot. I will say it feels very soft and hydrating. If my face didn't become so hot and red I would definitely put this in my top 10 list.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Almost done with me first bottle and let me tell you this has provided EXACTLY the hydration my skin has been looking for! It's light enough that it doesn't feel like it sits on your skin and works so well to prep my skin for makeup. I can't wait to buy more when it's back in stock!,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have repurchased this serval times. I have extremely sensitive, dry, acne prone skin and have had moderate to severe acne for years. This product is lightweight and hydrating but I have never really seen any real difference. I don't feel like this product repairs or maintains hydration at all. It feels nice at first but really doesn't do much to help anything. Buy this if you already have nice skin and want a little boost but other than that it doesn't do anything for skin that isn't already great.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have been using this for a few years now and love it. It seems to have become difficult to find recently so I hope it is not being discontinued.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I hated this product. I gave it over two weeks and noticed no difference. I've used other serums and found more immediate results. This is very sticky and slimey. It is actually pretty gross when you squirt a bit on to your hand and a string of slime attaches it too the dispenser.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I keep coming back to this product. It is perfect for my oily acne prone skin. It is a very light layer of moisture that plumps the skin and is very soothing. I don't know the science behind snail goo (if there is any) all I know is my skin misses this essence when it's gone from my routine.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've been using this essence since 2019 and let me tell you!!!! Wow! This helped my skin soo much. It's essential for my skin care routine. I had very dry irritated skin before using this, and now I don't have that irritated skin even when I don't apply the product. This product has done wonders for my skin",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This product helped my skin soo much, it feels more hydrated and ""glowy"". I absolutely love all of the snail mucin products! This isn't for everyone, though, so be cautious! MY HOLY GRAIL!!!!!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I broke out into a huge rash all over my face and it is taking forever to heal! Worst purchase ever this deserves 0 stars.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I had very high expectations prior to purchasing this and all of my expectations were met. What stood out to me when I first put on this product was that instead of irritating my skin and redness occurring, the product soothed my skin. I have very sensitive skin so this is always an issue. I apply this product on my skin while damp. I definitely recommend doing this as it helps the skin absorb the product better. I have just begun to get into Korean skin care and this was my first Korean product. I am so impressed and excited to try more products from this specific brand.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"i was scared to use this at first because of course after i bought it already it started showing up on my social media saying it caused people to break out and i am breakout prone. but i decided to just try it anyways because i can't go based off what others say. and my goodness i am so glad i tried this!! it actually helped get rid of my breakouts, it keeps my dry winter skin smooth and hydrated, it has actually helped do wonders for my dark spots after having acne. my skin has actually never looked better. this product was an excellent addition to my routine and i'll never stop recommending it to people! give it a try.",1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,It has really revitalizes my face after years of drying it out to get rid of acne. I also have sensitive skin and it didn't make me breakout. My skin looks the best it ever has!,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"LOVE this product!!!! A lot of people are complaining about acne‚Ä¶push through! It made me break out for a period of time as well, but I kept using it and it stopped. Now it just gives me a healthy glow and helps keep my skin clear! It helps with fine lines and hydration and also has a cooling effect after washing your face! Love it!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,i love this essence so much it really does help your skin you just have to use it over time,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I'm normally a ""keep it simple"" with only my cetaphil wash and vanicream, but I decided to try this after seeing a tik tok (easily influenced lol) and I now love it! It just adds to the hydration of your skin and if I have any type of bump on my skin it's gone the next morning",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I love this stuff!! I bought it for layering and extra hydration. My skin is super dry and I needed an extra oomph of moisture. I use this 2x a day and it's the first layer I put on. I use a lot because I love how easily it absorbs and it helps soak in the rest of my products I put on. Usually I use an oil and a facial moisturizer on top! I never notice any pilling. Definitely recommend to my dry humans out there!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've been using this product for about 2 months, I wanted to try it out for its anti aging benefits / helping repair skin barriers. Horrible idea. I've never had an issue with acne and since I started using this I broke out everywhere. I looked like I should belong in high school. I had major pizza face and a huge rash across my cheeks. Absolutely awful product. It's been a week since I finally decided to throw in the towel and admit that snail mucin is never going to work for my skin. I'm still covered in a rash and acne everywhere. I probably wouldn't recommend.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Could be cheaper,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This helps my dry skin so much. I use it with my retinol at nighttime and it makes my skin so much softer. I love it,1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Everyone raves about this product but all it did was give me really bad acne :/ I'm sure it has to do with the dust allergy that is connected to snails! Really hydrating, just not for my sensitive skin!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have acne prone/combo/sensitive skin and the serum was not moisturizing for me, it just kind of sat like a film and made me break out. It sucks bc everybody recommends snail mucin, aloe, and rose hip for oily/acne prone skin but those products only make me break out",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I was looking into products that would help my damaged skin barrier and this was highly recommended from people of all skin types and concerns. I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this stuff has been helping with my skin . I've noticed a difference since day one and continue to have major improvements. This product works best on freshly washed damp-wet skin tap the product in do not rub it . Do not apply on dry skin and also apply a moisturizer right after.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"To all the people saying this made their skin feel tight and the pilling bothered them, yes the product does pill when you add a moisturizer on top of it but once you rub the product into your skin it goes right away. Don't use this as the last step in your skincare otherwise yes your skin will feel a little tight but in the morning and with continued use, you're skin will look so dewy and moisturized",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I was conflicted after reading the reviews. So many reviews said great things and a few said they broke out etc.. I have acne prone skin so I was a bit scared at first. But i decided to just try it anyways since i'm not planning on leaving my house for a few days. and I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. first, it actually helped clear my current breakout within 3 days of usage, second my skin feels so much more hydrated I noticed a change in hydration within the first day of using it, even when i wash my face and have nothing on yet my skin just feels amazing. This product is amazing. I haven't noticed my acne scar dark spots fading yet i've only been using this for 2 weeks. but i'm hoping it does start to help fade them.",1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I'm not one to be sensitive to a lot of skincare but this really made my skin dry. So upsetting wanted to love but it made my face tight.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I am 46 with slightly aging skin( been using skin care since i was 14) I think i have pretty good skin for my age. With that being said, i do still have some redness on my nose and a little on my cheek area. This stuff is AMAZING. It took away any redness that i have and feels so good on the skin. I highly recommend this. This is my second buy. .. one small 1/2 pump is all you need. 1 bottles lasted me a year. and that is using it 2x a day.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I love this product! I have been using this product for 6+ months now. I'm in my 30s and my skin has been extra dry and sensitive most of my life. Thanks to this product my skin does not flake on my forehead anymore! It's also helped with the overall appearance of fine lines since it's so moisturizing. I used this product right after my toner and it helps other skin products absorb better. Love it!!!,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,The only serum that actually makes a difference with my dry skin,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,ive been wanting to try this since snail mucus became a trending skin care hype last year and I'm pretty sure I bought the last bottle lol sorry ladies. I see alot of reviews about breaking out which can be prevented if you do a quick patch test first .looking forward to the results so far so good.just wanted you write that headline to save some of you some pain and time .,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I was really excited to try this product. It ended up giving me hives and redness. I have sensitive, dry, and red skin so when I heard about this I was very excited. When I first applied it the results made me ecstatic. A few hours later I have itchiness and redness. Just be careful and patch test before applying.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"it's super hydrating and was a really nice addition to my skincare routine, until i realized it was causing some reactions on my skin. small, irritated bumps. it's not necessarily because the product is bad, my skin is just super sensitive. but even with these reactions it was super hydrating and felt so nice. i wish it would've worked out for me, but it seems to work fine for others so i'm jealous haha.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I used this for 4 days and I wanted to love it because it was very soothing and moisturizing but I woke up with 6 new pimples along with whiteheads that's why I never got it my oily acne prone skin did not like this,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is a great product to get hydration back in your face. This is also a great product if you have sensitive or acne skin. This product will calm your skin down if you use it religiously for a month or two, and make your acne scar less noticeable. Just please be aware that this product is thick and can feel sticky to the skin, but you will get use to the consistency of it. Worth the try and hype!",2,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I am not exaggerating when I say this product changed my life. After stopping topical steroid use I triggered either a bout of rosacea or perioral dermatitis that traveled all across my face. Before this product I was using a prescription topical treatment that dried my skin out. My face was red, scaly and painful. I purchased this product after seeing it talked about on tiktok. My acne prone skin is so sensitive that I can't easily introduce anything into my routine without causing cystic acne breakouts or redness. But this product absolutely changed and rescued my skin. I apply it two times a day, the best is after a shower while your skin is still wet and before your moisturizer. The snail mucin has relieved redness, helped heal my cystic acne break out, decreased my rosacea, hydrated my skin (during winter in a dry climate) and didn't break me out at all. I have struggled with sensitive dry skin my entire life and this product has been an absolute game changer. And I've tried a lot of skincare products geared towards rescuing dry skin and this product will be my go to for the rest of my life. I would add since snail mucin naturally contains contains hyaluronic acid this performs much better with a moisturizer on top to ensure water is being brought to the skin instead of moisture being pulled out of the skin.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"My skin type: combination oily, acne-prone (genetics) and sensitive. I use Curology so I have to be careful what I add into my routine. This however, has helped huge acne of mine heal up QUICKLY and help with scarring. If u already have perfect skin, skip this, u don't need it. If u have acne in general no matter the skin type (oily, combo, dry, normal) add this to ur routine as a spot treatment or to put on larger areas of ur skin that has multiple discoloration/ acne scars :) I hope this helps",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I bought this knowing nothing about it. I saw a tiktok nighttime skincare routine using ""essence,"" remembered something about mucin being good, and randomly picked this one. I was unsure about it after reading the reviews that this was drying. My skin is sensitive and easily angered. My skin was feeling tight after cleansing and needed moisturizer immediately to soothe it and hold off the visible dry patches. So anyway, I added this in my nighttime skincare routine. I use cerave cleanser, apply this, apply the laneige water sleeping mask, then lock it all in with cerave healing ointment. I noticed the difference immediately the morning after! Normally my skin feels dry after washing. Not anymore! I feel like my skin barrier is finally restored. My skin looks plump, and my finer lines are fading. I use it every other night, on alternate nights I apply retinol in its place.",1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I purchased this earlier last year yes a year ago and does what it's supposed to do I'm in my wonder years and this essence is absolute best for a woman with mature skin The lines are less especially around the mouth around the eyes look better as well you gotta ask your self what do you Want this Essence to do for your skin all products aren't for everyone that's why the market is saturated with so many saying Theirs is the best I was looking for a clean product The ingredient list is not a long one which means less other stuff in almost 2year of using this product it's great yes it does have a tackiness just don't use to much..It's a great purchase for the price,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I wanted to love this stuff but it wasn't for me. First , I knew it was the mucus from a snail but the texture made me want to gag. It peels easily on skin. Felt soothing but seriously I can buy others for half the price that can do the same thing.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"this product is not it. first of all, it made my skin really tight after i applied it. and second of all, it pills very easily. as soon as i put it on my skin, it flakes off. waste of money",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have noticed a difference in just a few days in regards to appearance. My skin is glowing & my acne scars already look less noticeable. I'm truly blown away because I have oily, acne-prone, sensitive skin and I was worried this wouldn't work for me based off other reviews‚Ä¶ however, I'm obsessed and this has become a nightly staple in my routine. It's a bit sticky upon application but if you rub it in enough, I feel no residue on my skin. I also like that it doesn't have any scent to it. The best part to me is that it's already helping to lighten acne scars that I've not been able to get rid of the past few months.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,So many people rave about this essence and I was so disappointed to find out it doesn't agree with my skin. It made my skin appear less hydrated? And it also caused weird texture. I really wanted to love this product.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Really glad I got the travel size bc I've heard from all my oily skin and acne prone gals that this is THE serum, but sadly it made me break out and would leave a strange film on my skin, which in turn made it feel like the product was on TOP of my skin, and not penetrating in at all. Squeaky tight feeling instead of soft and supple. I tried it over the course of a few weeks.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This irritated my skin very badly. It produced a red rash across my cheekbones and my nose. Caused a burning sensation on my skin and the marks hVe taken several days to subside. I really wanted to Love this after all the hyp about it. Unfortunately for me this is a fail of a product.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"literally i don't know what it is but this stuff is insane. it helps my acne scars, evens out my skin tone, hydrates my skin, leaves it looking glowy and flawless. i recommend this to literally everyone. a little goes a long way, i'll have a bottle of this last for like 6 months and i use about two pumps twice a day. i'm on my second bottle now because i cannot live without it. everyone i've recommended it to says the texture is weird at first but that you get used to it and can't live without it.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Heard some recommendations and bought it. It feels really nice on the skin and definitely hydrates for a glowy complexion!,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This feels amazing on your skin and gives you the most gorgeous glow! Not heavy either. I adore Cosrx products.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Recently I had dry and flakey patches on my face & this immediately brought the hydration it needed!! This leaves your skin so soft and bouncy I loveeee it! And the gel texture is amazing for my combo skin! I would marry this essence lol,5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've been using this product for about 6 months now and honestly, this is the type of product I don't ever see myself being without ever again. I have VERY dry skin and I've always had a problem with redness, especially around my nose/mouth. Literally the day after using this, my skin was SO plump and it seriously looked like I had gotten some work done! My forehead especially looked super smooth. My forehead lines that are normally super prominent looked like they had vanished overnight by 70 percent. Using this religiously has truly made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin. My redness has significantly calmed down and any time I get a bad breakout or inflammation, this helps heal it. In most cases, it even makes any scarring go away in a matter of days. After using it for about 6 months, I still have a little under half the bottle left and I use it pretty liberally every day. I've found that it's best to pat it into the skin. The consistency is a bit sticky/gooey and the smell is a bit odd but it's really not that bad. It might seem weird to some because of the content of the product but if you can get over that, you should really try it out!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have combination skin- it's dry and then produces more oil. This definitely help moisturize without making me oily. I've worked at Ulta for a while now and this is by far my favorite product I've tried. I feel like everyone needs this. Made my skin so healthy and happy!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've gone through 2 of these and I'm obsessed!,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,My skin loves it and ive seen a huge difference how glowy my skin is when I have make up on my face,1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I'm currently trying another product, but really I want my snail mucin back. This was my go-to for two years.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Works great on my dry skin love that hydrate and leaves your face smooth,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This has slowly started to clear up my face and i'm loving it. I also noticed my face is brighter after using it.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This product itself is great so far after couple days of using, the packaging itself is basic, not alot details about the product on the package.. the only way you get details is thru the website or on here.. the price is great.. it not super expensive and a lil bit goes long way. I used it after I wash my face and toner. It's does leaves a tacky texture on the skin, might be great to used before makeup, but haven't tried that out yet. I used at nighttime. I hope I continue to like it after the 28 day test",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is the best thing that has ever happened to my skin, it improved the texture almost over night. I could not be happier with this purchase.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I am OBSESSED with this product. I've only been using it for 3.5 days (I use it twice a day) and it has completely changed the texture and glow of my skin. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it didn't hydrate my skin as much as I think is promised but the brightness texture and barrier repair that it promises is real.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I use this product for my red acne scars and also when my skin is dry and irritated, truly a rescue product!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I initially tried this when it first released and it wasn't super popular in the US yet. I saw it's potential from the beginning but took a break after I ran out because I love trying new products so I went a few years without buying it again. I bought it earlier this year again and now that I ran out again, I've realized how amazing this essence is! It adds great hydration to the skin, feels nourished and the best part of me is that it heals your skin very fast. I have hormonal acne so there's always something popping up and now that I don't have it, I see how much longer my acne takes to go away so obviously I had to order another one. Snail muccin has shown healing properties but Cosrx doesn't market it probably because of the lack of robust research. But I promise you will notice a difference when you use this for a long time. And it last so long too!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I kept hearing about the benefits of snail products for a while but never bought anything to try for myself. I can confirm there is something in it after using this. I opted for the snail muci power essence after finding it in a Youtube tutorial and then researching it. Slimy is the first word I'll use with this one, texture-wise I don't think I've used something quite like it before! The fluid is very lightweight and melts into the skin quickly. It has a pleasant orangy scent and spreads smoothly around the skin. I feel moisturized after wearing this and fresh! I feel that it helps with dry skin and even adds a little glow to my cheeks and forehead area? Must be down to that shiny 96% snail secretion power! I only use around two pumps and that is enough for my entire face and neck - so a little goes a long way which is great. I feel like my skin is replenished after using this, and I sometimes apply a thin layer before bed like a sleeping mask, to work its magic through the night. The packaging is simple, with a pump which I prefer as you only use the amount you need. -> My 'Ulta Beauty Top 7 must-have list' (My 7 favorite beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Ulta) < - < 1.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've been using this for about 2-3 weeks and omg it's what my routine was missing! It's helped reduce my acne and my acne scars are fading quickly. It also makes my skin so plump and hydrated. I use it alongside the la roche posay cleanser and moisturizer,1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This product has worked wonders in just a few days. I'm only in my late 20s but I have a few fine lines on my forehead, presumably from stress/payback from unhealthy habits in my early 20s. I've tried so many hydrating products, expensive moisturizers, changing my diet, chugging water all day every day, but no luck. This was exactly the product I needed to finally draw moisture into my skin. I've been applying morning and night right after cleansing and my fine lines have diminished so quickly in just barely a week. I never write reviews for products but my skin looks just as plump and hydrated as it did at 16! The consistency is pretty slimy at first, but dries down really well and is not sticky at all. Already bought a 2nd bottle for my mom!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,My skincare routine hasn't changed for a year and I've had completely clear skin UNTIL I decided to buy this. I put it on and the next morning I had pimples all over my face. Yes I counted. 8 on my forehead. One on my nose. And 7 on my cheeks. I'm really horribly shocked lol.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,if I was stranded on an island this would be the one item I take with me. very soothing. helped my inflamed pimples heal faster. will forever purchase.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This has definitely became a new necessity for me. I use it every morning and night after washing my face and before moisturizer and it has completely changed my skin. I've noticed it helps make my pore less noticeable and overall makes my skin so smooth and helps with discoloration.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have sensitive combo skin. I struggle with some redness/discoloration issues and texture issues. This product has transformed my skin. I have used it in combination with other products or by itself, but I can always tell the next day when I have skipped it. It makes my skin so soft and calm the next morning. My redness/discoloration is less apparent, the texture feels smoother, and my skin feels more plump and hydrated. Every night or every other night I pair this with a Paula's Choice exfoliant - usually the 2% BHA liquid exfoliant and the two products work so well together at keeping my skin calm and smooth.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I saw this product on TikTok so I thought I'd try it out. While it was extremely hydrating I started to notice little white under-the-skin bumps appearing on one cheek, so I stopped using it and the bumps have since not disappeared.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Really love this, it really helped repair my skin barrier in places and gave it that hydration boost. It's little slimy, but that doesn't matter to me too much I have dry sensitive skin and it use it before mosturizer or sunscreeen really is like skin multivitamin.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"When I need a bit more moister, I use this along with the moisturizer(overnight or during the day) I'll feel the difference. Great product over all. Doesn't make your face greasy and can be used under makeup",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I'm so glad I bought this! It's become a skincare must for me. It's really changed how hydrated and plump my skin is in a week. I use it morning and night and I'm in love! I actually like the texture it feels very supple and hydrating.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I bought this because I didn't want to commit to a larger size if I didn't like it. Even so, it's lasted for a long while (a little goes a long way). I have dry, eczema prone skin, so I look for strong moisturizing products. This is it. It leaves my skin feeling SO PLUMP every time, and I can definitely notice the difference when I don't use it. In my normal routine, I use it after toner. The consistency is as you'd expect, so only use a little because it can get sticky and hard to absorb otherwise. Then once you've patted it into your skin, it's ready for your moisturizer! Love this, will definitely buy again.",4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I use this right when I get done cleansing and when my face is still a little damp, this product has amplified my other skincare items' effectiveness by 3000% and made my moisturizer work much much better. I've even used this product when my face became inflamed/irritated and it soothed and calmed it down right away. A 10/10 in my books.",3,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Broke my skin out for months after using half the bottle i had to throw it away if you have sensitive skin dont use it just get vitamin c to clear up scarring cause it only cleared up my rosacea a little bit,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Wow!! I've never used a product that made me glow as much as this! 5/5,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,lasts forever and feels so good,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I don't find the consistency sticky or gross - it's very comparable to a HA that I use. I've been using the product for almost two weeks - haven't noticed much of a difference in my skin other than it feeling softer. I have noticed black heads appearing more on my nose - but that could just be my skin getting used to the product (as it tends to do). Will give it more time :),4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,used for seven months just to find out this was the product that ruined my skin. Once i stopped using it my skin cleared up. Maybe i Was allergic to an ingredient ???,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I love this bottle for spending the night somewhere where I don't have my normal elf essence! My serums soak in wonderfully after applying this, definitely take this for travel",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,i use this 2x a day after cleansing on damp skin and lock it in with my moisturizer,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,work good for me and i really bought this one because i wanted to buy it instead of buying the bigger version. this small one is going to last u a while because u don't need a lot to cover ur whole face,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have been battling red/flaky/bumpy skin on my cheeks for the past few years..I haven't been diagnosed but, always thought it was possibly rosacea...only after about a week of using this just in the morning my skin has transformed! The bumps and redness are gone..really amazing!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is an excellent product. This product feels very high end but is super affordable. The texture does take getting used to and it is my least favorite part about the product just because it takes a tiny bit more patience since it has a slimy texture. This does NOT gross me out or anything- I simply don't like it because it takes a little longer to work with. But I know this is just the nature of the filtrate and not the brand's fault, so I didn't deduct a star in the rating. This product feels like a slimy version of The Ordinary's Buffet serum if you've ever tried that. Equally hydrating; just a little thicker and slimier. Sometimes I like to mix a 50/50 puddle of Buffet and this essence and apply both. Such a bomb combo and makes the Snail essence a little easier to apply. I always apply either this combo or just the essence onto damp skin like you always should with hydrating serums.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"The texture took me awhile to get used to. It does feel slimy when you apply it, but once it has soaked into the skin the sliminess disappears and the skin just feels plump, hydrated and a little dewy. Honestly I'm not the biggest fan of the texture, but the results are worth it.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I bought this because of the popularity, but this breaks me out super bad. I also didn't see any more hydration in my skin. I've seen reviews saying it may have a new formula than previously, and I can believe that.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I saw a instagram video of someone who had a pore moisture barrier with there skin and they said this product helped them. Over the last couple years I kept having random break outs and it turns out that can happen when you have a weak moisture barrier. Using this stuff I noticed a change immediately and my skin has cleared up! I love it,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This has replaced my toner stage. It's the base I put down before all my actives, and I simply adore this product. Sometimes I will go a few days without it and my skin can tell. I loves this stuff.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"snail mucin is my hero ingredient. this essence softens my skin and has noticeably faded my acne scars! the texture takes a bit of getting used to, but when you get over it, you can really appreciate its benefits.",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I love this product! It helps reduce my redness and hydrates my dry skin without feeling heavy. It's also helped to even out my skin tone and texture, especially acne scarring. Would recommend for any skin type",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I usually apply this after a certain moisturizer just because my skin is irritated by the smallest gentle breeze but this stuff keeps my skin supple and glowy. It feels a little slimy, obviously, but I love the way it makes my skin feel and it layers great with the other products I use after this. Seriously y'all, worth the buy.",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have relatively normal peri menopausal skin with break outs. This didn't absorb and left a film on my skin.

I just feel like I need it- but it doesn't do all the work you need an occlusive on top. Then again for the price I guess it's understandable that it won't fix all your problems- it's a reasonable cost for a very good product. I'm excited to try their honey propolis products too. Seems to be a decent company.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have super sensitive and dry skin. I was hesitant to try a new product since it is so easy to set off a break out. Ever since starting to apply night & morning I wake up with smooth feeling skin and the breakouts I did have have healed so quickly. Definitely recommend.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Dried out my combo skin :(,4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"For anyone with acne prone skin, this is not for you.",1,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,had this product for a while in my routine and it gives such good moisture to the skin. it is a bit sticky at first but it doesn't dry down sticky. would recommend to someone who has dry skin.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,It's got a pretty simple ingedient list and it feels super yummy on my skin. It feels like I'm applying fat water to it. I really do think it's helped with moisture retention and I would totally suggest this as an extra hydrating step.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I haven't seen any difference. May have too many chemicals as my skin is slightly sensitive to it.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is the first essence I've ever used. I'm 19, almost 20, and I just moved to Arizona from South Carolina and my skin has not taken it well moving from a super humid climate to a super dry climate. This, and the snail cream, have really helped my skin become moisturized and plump again. All I need is one pump for my whole face. It soaks in great and is light enough for my oily areas (T-zone). I'm absolutely in love with it. This is now my go-to essence.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I love this essence, my skin feels so soft and I can definitely tell my cheeks aren't dry as that's usually a big concern for me (combination skin here hello). My routine is simple cleaner cerave foaming cleanser, this essence vani cream and sunscreen during the day, at night it's cleanser then essence followed by azelaic acid from the ordinary then moisturizer and I'm done. I noticed keeping my routine simple helps not overwhelm your skin.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I bought this a few weeks ago and have used it every morning and every night. My skin is so much softer. It has this healthy glow. I have noticed that if I use this after exfoliating, I have zero irritation at all. I will absolutely repurchase. This will not replace your moisturizer but it makes it more effective. Since using this, my skin doesn't feel dry when I wake up in the morning. The texture takes a little getting used to, it is well...slimy. But honestly it's not as bad as you might imagine and you get over it quick.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have very dry, sensitive, and severe eczema prone skin. This has been such a life changer and has helped fade a lot of the hyperpigmentation on my face. My face is so smooth now and you NEED THIS!!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,My skin has so much hyperpigmentation. Since I started using this toner twice a day my skin has shown tremendous progress. It hasn't been even 4 weeks since I started using this. It's a magic in a bottle.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I thought this product would be slimy but was very surprised. I have noticed a difference within the first week.,4,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Works like a charm! I have been having a really hard because of my hyperpigmentation after breakout spent hundreds of dollars to find a right product for me but this was it! I've only used this for two weeks with glycolic acid, essence, and moisturizer and it literally works like a charm. Beyond satisfied!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,Evens out skin tone,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Ive been using this for about a year. The texture through me off for a bit but I use it when I do my facial massages. So far I havent really seen any changes, even after a year but I enjoy using it. With that being said I doubt that I will buy again.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,In places I don't usually breakout. Little whiteheads. It's bad,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I use this with my serums and moisturizers to help them sink into my skin better and it has upped my skincare game to the next level. It stretches my other products and has never broken me out in the slightest! My sensitive skin just loves it!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Let me first say I love this product! It is super hydrating and super refreshing. My skin is sensitive to many common skincare ingredients so it's always hard finding products that won't irritate me but still work. Usually when I do theyre super expensive. This was a random pick after some research because it was relatively inexpensive. I think the consistency will initially throw you because it is pretty slimy when you first put it in your hands. But I think if you can get past that, I guarantee it doesn't disappointment. I find it's all about how you apply it. If you're unsure get the travel size (what I did). A little goes a long way with this stuff so you get a good trial. My skin really has never felt softer and I have pretty soft skin to begin with. Totally worth it!!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I've been using this product nearly consistently since I was 25. It always had the most nourishing, light and clean slightly sticky moisturizing feel, but not oily. I was concerned when they changed the packaging that they may have changed the formula order, and it appears they did. It's not the same at all, it (so far) hasn't broken me out ((it's been a week)....but it feels more gummy, thicker, not as easy to spread, immediately when I put it on it doesn't have the same skin quenching feeling it feels like a gummy barrier and the ingredients feel obsolete and impotent. I'm probably going to have to ditch and replace it...sucks this was my saving grace. Biggest differences noted: the old formula used to literally MAGICALLY make my skin supple slightly dewy hydrated and my pores would nearly disappear! This was seriously a magic potion and it cost so little. Now, feels like trash my skin kinda itches a bit, pores are gross and feel full of gummy stuff and it has a filmy feeling on my face. Maybe I got a bad batch, but the ingredients apparently got shifted in their order with less emphases on the actual active ones. Bummer.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I love this essence! Super hydrating and love how dewy and fresh it makes my skin look. I primarily use this for my day time routine when I am not using any actives or serums (wash, tone, essence, and moisturizer). I like to follow this up with the cosrx advanced 96 snail mucin cream on days when I am makeup free because the glow is UNREAL!",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Husband and I both have soft, bright, pretty skin now. It helped a lot with my redness. Thank you, snails.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This product is so moisturizing yet still lightweight! I use it at the beginning of my skincare routine before applying anything else and it instantly hydrates my skin. Love it!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I started using this serum a few weeks ago and am obsessed! I have very dry, sensitive skin. (I literally could moisturize three times a day and my skin would still be dry) but after adding this into my routine, I've found that it locks in moisture so well and my skin is moisturized, smooth, and plump all day. First I double cleanse, use my other essences/serums, then apply this masterpiece. Would absolutely recommend!",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Currently on my second bottle and will keep repurchasing. After a few days of use, I was loving how my skin looked and felt. This product is lightweight, moisturizing, and helps reduce the redness from acne. When first applied it is slightly slimy and sticky since it is snail mucin but that dries down within a couple minutes. I use it morning and night after cleansing and have no issue layering products on top of it.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"A lot of people seem turned off by the idea of using snail secretion, but the proof is in the pudding. I have dry skin, and this is my go-to when I need extra hydration. It doesn't feel sticky or tacky and applies beautifully. Don't know if it necessarily helps with fine lines, but it definitely plumps and gives a ""glass skin"" effect.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,This is the best essence I ever used. So hydrating yet super light. My skin is the softest and brightest it's ever been,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I would return this but I've waited too long. I'll probably use this on my hands or legs because it's fine product. However, my skin can be a bit reactive and this indeed breaks me out. To be sure it was this product, I used it. Broke out. Stopped using it and my skin cleared up. Used it two days and then had FIVE blemishes. However, the texture is lovely and melts into skin. For the right skin type this would be wonderful. got it on a Beaty steal so only about $10 lost on this one. No smell which is nice and dries quickly",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've been using this for over a year and loved it cause it kept my dry skin HYDRATED (i even put my friends and they loved it too). The problem is that now my face (and my friends' faces) are breaking out like crazy! Nothing new has been added to my skincare routine besides the new bottle which I purchased last month. Please change it back to the old formula! i love this essence a lot because it's the only one that does the job but now it's not it. ._.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This is another K beauty product I saw great reviews on, and wasn't disappointed. I use the peach and lilly glass serum and love that. This is slightly different, although it still makes your complexion look great. It is slightly sticky, I've found if my face is a little dampened it goes on so much smoother. It makes my pores smaller and my face look more even toned. I know it's supposed to be great for acne prone and oily skin. I can't attest to those. For my dry/normal and sometimes sensitive skin it works well. I notice my pores are smaller and my skin looks smooth with a nice glow. I purchased the travel/sample size to try it, but I will buy the larger one next time. It doesn't take a lot to get good coverage(especially if your face is damp), so it should last awhile.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"i love this essence, i use it morning and night and am on maybe my third bottle. i have very dry skin so i use it as the first of several hydrating steps but for more normal skin it'd be nice alone as a light moisturizer. i don't think it's sticky when used in a thin layer. so fresh, so clean!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I love this versatile product-- there's a reason why it's viral and so well loved. I use this brightening, moisture barrier building serum in so many ways! To boost lightweight moisturizers, to help dilute certain stronger serums, and I even pile it on and use it as a sleep mask.. This overtime has helped completely plump out my forehead which used to have deep, deep horizontal lines even when I rested my face. My makeup used to crease and cake up and now it's totally plumped out. I have to squeeeeze my forehead to even get it to look how it used to.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,great on top of moisturizer,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I can definitely notice the difference in my skin. It is more hydrated, less red, and my acne has been less inflamed. Don't expect this to be a miracle product, though! You do need to have a concise routine. This product should definitely become a staple in everyone's routine.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I am such a skincare fanatic and love trying out new products when others run out. I have dry skin and needed a moisture boost so I purchased this product. I have used this product for 2 weeks and it has done absolutely nothing for my skin... so disappointed!!!,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I use a generous amount of this as the last step of my nighttime skincare routine and let it dry before going to bed. the consistency is a bit sticky, but its not exactly ""slimy"" in a gross way. I actually like how it feels on my skin. I stock up on this whenever it's on sale.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Been using this for about a month around the same time I started introducing retinol into my routine. This acts as a great barrier product, seems to brighten my skin, and helps it retain moisture. A little goes a long way-I use 1-2 pumps per time- and the texture is no more off putting than other gel based serums or products.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I got a sample trial of this in a gift from Ulta and I was not sure about it but after using it for a few days some acne scars I've had for years healed so quickly! I feel like my skins really plump and hydrated but also I have less acne and inflammation!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I am a skincare junkie & after hearing Skincare By: Hyrum recommend it I had to buy it. My skin feels amazing in the morning and looks glowy. I like that it's easy to layer with other products such as if you want to put it on in the am before sunscreen or at night with other creams. I love the price range. Great quality for a great price!!,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"tried this just to see. it is sticky and the stringy texture was a little offputting at first, not gonna lie, but once i figured out how to use it and NOT get the stringy effect, I've noticed my face is much more dewy in the morning. so it definitely does lock in moisture. I'm going to continue using this to see what other long term benefits can be gained.",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This product brightens my skin a bit. I see it working on my fine lines but it seems to, MAY be, drying it out a bit and I have dry skin.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Great product! I've been looking for products to address hydration and aging, without breaking out my skin. This is fabulous! If you are on the fence about trying it because it comes from snails, rest assured it has no smell and is not too tacky. I love it so much!!!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I really like it. It's very hydrating And works better than most hyaluronic acid serums! Very thick but not heavy or greasy.,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. Not sure if I notice any difference yet but I will continue using it. It is a little slimy but not bad at all. Once you have it on your face it is absorbed pretty well. My skin is soft and I haven't had any reactions to it. Will see how it works after 1month.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,works amazing. it doesnt make me break out. it keeps my skin soft hydrated and refreshed looking all day. defiantly worth the price.,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I was surprised I started to see results in 1 day. I cleanse, tone, and then add this product before moisturizer. Softer skin with decreased furrows and lines. It is almost like maple syrup in that it can have ropes when you apply it but tapping it into the skin and it absorbs in. It also does not cause breakouts or rashes on sensitive combination skin. My friend from Singapore had been using similar products for years and had amazing skin. Wish I had started using it sooner!",5,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have dry and very sensitive skin and am allergic to most skincare products (cerave cleansers, ANYTHING with fragrance) and this product has been a lifesaver for my skin. I live in a very dry climate and putting this on before moisturizer has helped my skin so much, my redness has gone down, my texture has improved and my skin doesn't feel tight and dry throughout the day. This is such a calming and soothing product and I think it could be beneficial to all skin types",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"This product gave me acne and made my face peel for days. I discontinued the product right away. Cleared up my skin and tried it again and it gave me the exact same result, acne and peeled my skin. It also takes forever to absorb into the skin even when using a light amount. I would not buy this product again.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I use this before moisturizer and after my serum and my skin drinks this up like water. It definitely is more supple, even and healthier looking after I use this product. The moisture it gives is great. It's especially nice for oily and combination skin, due to the gel-like texture and how it sinks into the skin. I use 2-3 pumps for my whole face and it works perfect.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I find this makes a great dupe for the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair serum for a fraction of the cost. This product is tacky but, for the love of Pete, dampen your fingers with water when you apply! That is a must do! Otherwise you will not like it and the negative reviews probably didn't know to do that.. This product locks in moisture (use it before your moisturizer) and sinks into your skin so nicely doing all of its magical stuff.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've been using this for about 8 months (and I'm only ~halfway through the bottle) and I love this stuff. I don't find it to work any miracles for things like acne or redness but I definitely don't notice more acne or redness which is great for sensitive skin like mine. This works wonders for dryness though. Makes your skin look very healthy and a bit shiny at first.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I purchased this at 50% off which was coincidentally the same time that I decided to incorporate a serum into my daily routine. I only use 3-4 pumps for my face after washing (make sure your skin is still supple, not dry!) followed by a moisturizing cream. I have very dry skin (especially in winter) but have noticed that my skin still feels like it has an abundance of moisture locked in by the evening! I expect this bottle to last for many months at the rate I am using it. Note: snail mucin has properties of... snail excretion. If you pump a drop onto your finger, the product will ""string"" out as you lift the bottle away. I feel like this attribute may turn some people off so keep that in mind.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"A little of this product goes a long way! Use one to two pumps of this after your toner! It melts into the skin & gives the best glow!

It moisturizes my skin like no other and helped me to combat my dark spots!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I really love this product. I bought it on a total whim because it was promoted as good for soothing dry sensitive and had a 3x's point bonus. I read the reviews and they seemed legitimate. My skin ever since I turned 31 has become quite dry and sensitive but I also have the occasional breakout. I use about a pump and a half of this after cleansing. In the morning it's vitamin c serum and sunscreen and at night it's a heavy moisturizer.,2,,

I've been using this for almost 2 months now and the psoriasis and any other irritation is GONE. I use it daily in the AM right after cleansing on damp skin. Will definitely recommend and repurchase!",5,,

I've used it for about over a week and I definitely noticed my skin feeling softer and being an oily skin person this is perfect.

Definitely buying again.,2,,

I am curious to see what it will do for my skin during Texas summers.",4.7,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I have been using for about two weeks, love how it instantly made my face more radiant and soft. It did make me breakout a bit, as anything does when you first start using it, but I have also seen it clearing up my face and making my skin more even.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I've been using this product a little over a week now and I love It but I couldn't give It five stars because It hasn't lived up to the hype. It works great but I've seen several skin care influencers raving about It and while It has evened out my skin tone and texture it's not yet helped to fix the broken blood vessels or reduced any scaring even a little. if It does I'll update my review!,2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,First time used its slimy üòÇ just a little that caught me off guard. One pump is really all you need unless you got really dry skin then maybe one in a half pumps.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I love this product. The consistency is odd but ones you get used to it is not big deal and even thou you need time to see results it works great at soothing skin,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I think I'm one of the few people for whom this product causes breakouts. Every time I put it back into my routine I get pimples, which is usually pretty rare for me. I tried this as part of the cosRX sample pack, so it's not a ton of money lost.",4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I was skeptical about this product at first but I'm really enjoying using it. It absorbs quickly and I use it as a first step in my skincare routine day and night. I apply after toner then use my serums and moisturizers. Does not cause breakouts and leaves my skin soft.,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I don't know if I randomly got lucky, but since using this for only two weeks I have seen a difference in my skin. It looks brighter and healthier and honestly somehow my acne has calmed down and scars are goin away a little bit. I am 23 and have had acne since I was 13. It has just shifted around my face over the years. I started using the Mario Badescu acne cleanser about two months ago, everyday, but I didn't see a big difference until I started using this serum only two weeks ago. So I don't know if it's the combination of the two or what, but I am impressed and happy. I actually got a small sample of it for Christmas, but I will most likely be buying a bottle when I run out. And you don't need much of it so it lasts",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Inflamed acne, texture, impaired barrier, dull skin, the list goes on.. does not have a fight when adding this into your routine.

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I got this in a little trial size as part of some gifts with my order. I had never used an essence of any kind before but I gave it a go and I'm so happy I did. It absolutely transformed my acne prone skin and brings out a hydrated looking natural glow. I loved it so much I ordered the regular size bottle and need it to get here NOW!,5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"My face is glowy , soft , hydrated, it was very soothing to multiple breakouts and I'm barely breaking out at all now. I can skip moisturizer altogether on the more humid days with this stuff I still get grossed out by its consistency before I apply but it is worth it. It absorbs into the skin like a dream",4.7,,

Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I am 37 and have had skin problems most of my life. I've been using this after cleansing and toning and it's made such a huge difference in the appearance and feel of my skin. It looks much more plump, less redness and inflammation",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"Soooo. I'm 53 with combo skin & rosacea. My skin otherwise is pretty normal. At the sale price & after reading all the super positive reviews I decided to try it not having much expectations anyway. I tried hard to wait longer to review but couldn't stand it. It's only been a few days using this but OMG!!!! This stuff is to live for!! I'm serious it really has made such a difference in my skin & my rosacea in a few short days! When you put it on it's nothing special & you don't really feel anything unique about it...So that may disappoint you at first but once you keep using it & see the results you will be blown away! I have basically only been using in the morning but I have used it at night a couple of times. My face looks so much better, younger, smoother & less red with no makeup on! I hope they never change the formula & that this will continue to work wonders on my face as time goes by. I would definitely purchase again hopefully on sale!!",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I use this product after toning . Sadly, I have not noticed an improvement in my skin. It is possible there is an improvement, but I do not see it.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I bought this to use because I have been breaking out A LOT on my chin because of the face masks. I have been using it for about a week, and I can definitely see a difference! I use it either in the morning or night sometimes both and I already have seen my skin less red and no pimples! I love this. I will continue to use it!",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,I apply this every morning and night to keep my face hydrated. I also apply the Snail Mucin 3 in 1 moisturizer. The best ever for my dry skin. The Essence and Moisturizer helps to prevent the drying effect that RetinA can cause. I love this stuff and always stock up !,4.7,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I'm in my early 40s and have always been mistaken for early 30s until 2020 happened... stress its effects on my already maturing skin (and hormones) caused my skin to rapidly change from combination to DESERT DRY. Crazy fine lines and flakiness by the end of the day just made my make up look god-awful by the end of the workday, and no creams or serums seemed to work. I started using high-concentrate ceramides, and it sloooowly made some change in hydration, but still looked aged and dry. I ordered the Cosrx essence and lightly patted a couple pumps of the liquid... looks sticky and like clear snot when you have the flu... once you get passed that moment, you can appreciate how moist and soft your skin immediately feels. I let it dry a bit and added another layer. I then added a layer of the Cosrx All In One on top and went to bed. The next morning, my skin looked Pretty. IT FELT SO SOFT and looked healthy. I applied my usual makeup and watched it throughout the day, and while it started becoming dry, it never got to the flakey cracked appearance I've been dealing with for months. I bought a humidifier for my home to keep my skin hydrated and will continue using. So far, a couple days in, it still feels good. I hope this continues to improve.. worth a try to anyone dealing with similar issues.",5,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"i tend to use this when my face is angry and really dry from retinol. it's one of the only products that doesn't burn when my skin is freaking out, it seems to speed up the healing process. i really love it.",2,,
Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"I noticed a mild burning sensation with this product. In days I used it I also noticed that my eyes felt dry and irritated. I don't have sensitive skin but sometimes I experience burning with products that contain Phenoxyethanol. I don't experience it with every product that it's in which is good because it's in almost everything. However, when I feel a mild burning after applying a product, it always has Phenoxyethanol in it. This essence doesn't have many ingredients and one of them is that preservative so maybe that's why. It's a bummer because usually Korean skincare is pretty clean and they often come up with creative ways to preserve their products such as zanthoxylum-piperitum fruit extract. ( a Japanese pepper that acts as a preservative). I sucked it up and used this essence for about a month. I think it helped keep my skin moisturized but other than that I didn't notice any or the other results that snail mucin products boast.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have mature skin and this has definitely made it smoother and more plump. Almost adds a glow. A little goes a long way and I use it at night as I didn't like how it layed under my primer.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"COSRX snail serum was out of stock when I needed more so I tried this instead. It's basically a heavier version of that, somewhere between a serum and a moisturizer. If you're oily like me this could totally replace moisturizer when it's hot & humid!",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I tried this out for about a week and even though it didnt cause breakouts, I still returned it. My face felt dry and tight and not hydrating at all. It feels like it just sits on your face. I have combo skin and it just didnt work for me.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've never written a review on a prpduct, but I had felt inclined to warn people. My skin can handle new skincare pretty well but this broke me out so bad.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Love it,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Great products,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This product is moisturizing and doesn't break out my sensitive skin. The texture is unique (sticks to my hand when I pull it away from my face) but it is 92% snail mucin so it's nothing surprising or bothersome.,4,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This product is working miracles on my skin. I have been playing around with my perfect skincare routine and I think this product is what I needed. My skin gets horribly dry in the winter. I'm the dry skin queen. I was using another brand night cream, but that started clogging my pores. I bought ELF Holy Hydration moisturizer and my skin felt better. I saw this on sale and I was like, this probably would help. Omg. I put this on first, let it dry, then the elf cream. This + the elf has left my skin feeling smoother than ever before. Even when I wash my face in the shower my skin feels like pillows. I *think* this product enhances the ingredients of other products. Before I put this on, I use The Ordinary Niacinamide and ABA serums. I had been using both of these serums for like 8 months, with no noticeable difference in my dark spots. As soon as I added this Snail Cream in my routine, in a month the dark spots have reduced quicker than they had the whole 8 months before. So, yeah, I'm never going back! This has completely changed my skincare and I'm feeling wonderful.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"My skin loves this, s littke goes a long way.

I havd extremely sensitive skin and has not had a reaction with none of products by Cosrx.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Not that moisturizing and honestly such a mid product. It leaves weird flaky patches on my skin as well.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Really good and light feeling for people who are sensitive to textures. Layers well with different brands without pilling. I could feel an immediate difference after the first two days of usage which is rare in skincare.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,perfect for oily skin my skin feels softer. looks shiner,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I love all of the Cosrx snail mucin products and bought this without reading any reviews or researching. I've been using Missha super aqua cell renew snail cleanser for years and it's my favorite affordable hydrating cleanser. I won't be returning the Cosrx, but I doubt I will repurchase, solely because it smells like cheap dish soap to me and is unpleasant to use. It works fine, leaves my skin feeling hydrating and clean, but the smell is just off-putting for me and cheapens it. Pros: texture, hydration, lather, and no allergic reaction. Cons: price and smell",3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This is the best moisturizer I've ever used. This combined with the CosRx serum, and I feel like im aging backwards. My skin is tighter, smoother, and has a better complexion than it has in years!",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Its not very moisturizing at all. 30 mins after applying, my face already feels super tight and dry.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have tried several of the Korean companies latest products and I think this is the best one yet. It has become my favorite. I'm a senior male and even though I feel a little intimidated when shopping at Ulta it's worth it.,2,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I heard really good things about this so I bought it. As someone who has sensitive dry skin but still has acne this did not break out my skin and made me look glowy. However, it takes a while to dry even sometimes it's still not dry in the morning. It can make you feel greasy if you apply too much. A little goes a long way. I would recommend this and is my go-to moisturizer.",3,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have been using this for almost a year and also repurchased as I have dryer skin naturally and this was very soothing. I have acne prone skin and this never causes breakouts, it's pretty neutral I feel like, so it won't cure acne but also will sooth your skin. I even feel like it's ""too moisturizing"" so wouldn't use on oily skin but I needed the hydration.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,My dad cursed me with his sensitive skin so I'm very selective on what I put on my face. This product is amazing for my acne-prone/texture skin and doesn't leave my face feeling tacky or red. For the size bottle you get it's not terribly priced either.,5,,

It removes all the dirt, oil, and even light makeup with one wash without drying me out. Even if I double cleanse whenever I have on heavy makeup, this face wash still doesnt dry out my skin.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I struggle with acne spots on my face that quickly become stains or easily become scars. This product has been helping treat this greatly!

But very rarely get pimples or acne, just redness sometimes. For the first week, the product seemed ok, my skin felt more moisturized than usual but that was the only difference I noticed. Then I started getting tons of little red bumps all over my face that would not go away. There was nothing else I changed that would have caused this. I kept using it for a bit longer until I finally stopped using it. That was about 4 weeks ago and the outbreak is still persisting, finally slowing down a little bit!!

It moisturizes without clogging my pores. My skin has been way less oily, and I haven't broken out at all, even when it was that time of the month. I cant recommend this product highly enough. My advice is to give it a try for at least a week. You have to get past the texture, since it is snail mucin. However, I think most people will absolutely love and benefit from this product.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Beware of this product. I have never in my life anf eczema especially around my eyes. I used this for a couple of weeks and started noticing dryness and my skin feeling tight. I know it says not to use in eye area but accidents happen. I have stopped use of this and i am now dealing with eczema around my eyelids. Nothing seems to be helping the redness. If youre going to use this use extreme caution not to get it around your eye area,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This immedialtey hydrates my dry and sensitive skin. It also prevents any oily appearing pores. Has really healed my skin barrier. Very happy with my purchase.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Amazing,1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I bought this product last summer and didn't think much of it when i first tried it out. Then winter hit and my skin was so dry. This moisturizer is the only one I have that's an overnight fix for dry skin. I will always have this in my makeup bag from now on and will use this even when i dont want to use a lot of skincare. Worth every penny.,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"my skin has always been super sensitive to face creams and lotions so I was cautious when first trying it. my skin has never flet or looked better. between the snail mucin and this cream, my face is glowing! Where I live the winger climate is harsh and dries my skin out but this has completely fixed that, without the breakout! it feels a little greasy initially but soaks in super fast.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I am a big fan of this product for its ability to calm and restore the state of my skin's microbiome. I also notice that when used long term my skin looks radiant. However, when I first used this product I had no idea it wasn't necessarily a moisturizer. I use this on top of my other serums and underneath moisturizer, and it works wonders.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I really wanted to love this cream, but it broke me out. I will still use it on my hands.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"After incorporating the Cosrx Snail All In One Cream into my skincare routine, I'm absolutely delighted with the results! This cream has become a holy grail product for me. Its lightweight yet deeply moisturizing formula leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and supple. I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture and elasticity since using this cream regularly. The snail mucin extract works wonders in soothing and repairing my skin, making it look more radiant and youthful. Plus, it absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy residue behind. I can confidently say that the Cosrx Snail All In One Cream has earned a permanent spot in my skincare arsenal!",4,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"When applying the moisturizer it gives a very nice glowy-hydrated affect, but it doesn't absorb into the skin well and I would feel dry patches on my face later throughout the day. The product is very lightweight and may be good for people with oily skin, but not so great for drier skin types. It help clear my skin though.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I never had blackheads before using this product. My skin looks good with it on but I jave tiny bumps all over my face.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have sensitive skin that is very reactive and i was hoping this would help maintain my skin barrier. It goes on nicely and seems to make my skin feel good and healthy, but i started noticing that, every time i used it, i would get really bad cystic acne. I never get cystic acne and i dont notice this with any other products so im sure it has to be this one.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This snail mucin is such an essential step in my night time routine! I apply it on damp skin and seal it in with a moisturizer. I go to bed looking like a glazed donut and my skin feels so soft in the morning!,1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Reduces redness right after one use! Dries out super quickly, doesnt absorb skin ‚ÄºÔ∏è i pair it with their serum HOLY GRAIL my skins texture immediately improved",1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This cream is honestly incredible. I've used the regular cosrx mucin but this is next level. I have the most sensitive, reactive skin of anyone I know and this keeps my skin calm, soft & hydrated. No breakouts, no irritation whatsoever. So grateful üíó",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I didnt have a breakout for a long time. Within 2 days after using this product, i start seeing. I dont want to use the product.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I wanted to like this so bad but it gave me a horrible eczema breakout on my forehead. I have eczema on my body but I've never had a breakout on my face until trying this. I'm struggling to clear it up even after stopping use ‚òπÔ∏è outside of that, its a nice texture on your hands but just does not moisturize. I tend to have oilier skin on my face but it left me feeling dry and tight.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have very sensitive skin, there's not a lot I can put on my face and I won't break out in a rash. This stuff is nice. It keeps your skin moist for a while. It feels like my skin is suffocating sometimes when I put it on but maybe that's because my face is just so freaking dry because I live where there are below-freezing temperatures. But I would recommend it, it is very lightweight.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I'm not one to ever leave reviews but this product is just too good. I have SUPER dry skin due to acne medication I am on and it being winter on top of that. I have tried so many different creams/moisturizers, wasting so much money on products that didn't do anything for my dry skin. I went out on a whim yesterday and bought this cream. Typically when I wake up in the morning my face feels so tight and is literally peeling and flaking. This morning when I woke up I had no peeling or flaking and my face felt so hydrated. Not to mention the cream feels so good and has such a lux feel to it. I will never buy anything else ever again. Also this cream after using their snail mucin is chefs kiss. I'm so happy I don't have to waste anymore money on products that do nothing for me. if you have been wondering if you should get this cream you ABSOLUTELY should.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Maybe this would be better for a summer moisturizer, but in the winter, I'm not finding it to be hydrating enough. It is very light, though.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"OK so let me tell you when I first found out about this product. I started using the snail mucin power essense and fell in love with it i noticed it would even heal wounds on my skin. Then i decided to try out the all in one cream and let me tell you, i loved the consistency of it .. made my face feel super hydrated and smooth, but once i applied my make up I noticed my skin looks very dry around the nose area and forehead . I was disappointed and was not going to use it again but decided to try it for a week to see if there'd be a change or if i kept noticing dryness, I'd stop .. but im happy to tell you that after a few days of using this all in one cream day and night my skin balanced itself out and I absolutely love it . Its even helped with my acne scars. I definitely recommend this product. Im using the face wash, snail mucin and all in one cream and I absolutely love it . Its a must have",5,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,My new holy grail. I've used the cosrx snail mucin 92 power essence religiously for about two years with minimal results. After purchasing the advanced snail 92 all in one cream my skin feels the softest and smoothest its ever felt in my life after just two days of AM/PM use. Im tossing out the power essence and will stick with this from here on out!,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I love it. Its a favorite of mines the i use daily. Its my second time purchasing it because it works well with my dry skin.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"The title says it all...I heard amazing things about this cream, and since I was a few months into using AlphaRet and my skin felt acclimated, I decided to incorporate a new product into my routine to give my skin some TLC. Yeahhh...this made me break out into the itchiest rash and made my skin red and sensitive :( I can imagine it's amazing for some but it just really wrecked my skin (which is bizarre because I have used snail mucin before with no problems). Definitely patch test",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I was very surprised by the texture of this cream. It is very soft and has a luxurious feel. Its my first time trying a product from this brand. I am using it after the Dermalogica ultra calming trio kit because I believe my skin barrier needs repairing. I opted for this cream instead because they didnt have the one I wanted in Dermalogica, and I can not say that I all disappointed. (Though I havent tried the other one I was originally after, so I cant compare) I will say that after a week of use on my sensitive skin, I havent had any issues with breakouts or rash like other reviews mention. I notice that my face isnt producing as much oil during the day either when I use this. I do not know if it will have a permanent place in my routine but I would definitely recommend and might buy again :)",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This moisturizer is perfect for oily skin. I would say that it's a little too lightweight for my combonation skin personally. I have to mix it with the essence to get through the product. Definetly not for you if you want your glow to last, I get that initially but eventually my skin gets matte for the most part. But the formula and benefits are great, it really does heal the skin and diminishes the dark marks.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Did not read prior to buying that if you have dust mite allergies, you are prone to break out using this product. It caused me to develop terroble acne. After a week, I still havent been able to get these pimples to clear up",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I'm loving the glow and feeling of my skin after using this.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have acne prone skin and this product made me break out. Do not buy if you have combination skin. I do not recommend it.,1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Im in my mid 30's and this product has become a staple in my routine. Its not meant to be a moisturizer but is amazing to add to your skincare steps. I see people complain about that. This is not meant to be a one step cream. I use this cream as a step 3 in my routine morning and night.,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,it doesn't hydrate my skin,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I am 42 and have oily T-zone with enormous pores. This gave me a glass-looking T-zone after 2 nights of use. It also gets rid of hyperpigmentation. This also worked well on my 17 year old acne-prone son.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I cannot say enough great things about this cream. This product is exactly what i was looking for! I swear my bumpiness/texture on my forehead has greatly improved since using this. It's versatile enough for daytime or nightime use. I put it on under makeup and it keeps my skin fresh and glowy. I absolutely love this,1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have been using this moisturizer for years and im so happy Ulta has it now! I have extreeeeeeeemely sensitive skin and it quite calming.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This is my first review ever, and regrettably, I'm bummed to write it. I have been using several of the CosRX products and they have meshed well with my skin; that is until using this moisturizer. It does take some time for my skin to generally adjust, but I found that my face got even drier and reactive to this moisturizer over the span of 2.5/3 weeks of use. By the end of my usage, it was making my skin sting upon application. If you have sensitive or acne-prone skin, please heed caution when using this moisturizer.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've been using this product for a long time now, and the snail mucin line for years. The thing people always miss when they start using these products is that you should not be slapping them on dry skin and expecting them to absorb! Your skin should be slightly damp, like after you wash and lightly towel dry or immediately after applying a toner. Then you apply and pat in. Never had a problem and I reach for this on days when I know I need a lighter moisturizer instead of my usual under sunscreen.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I broke out in tiny whiteheads and my face felt rough for like 2-3 days,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"It floats on my skin and cannot be absorbed. It creates a layer and is easy to be washed off, so at first I liked it in summer because it kept my skin clean and not greasy (also I was using it with a dermalogica gel). But it does nothing to moisturize my skin and even dries it out. After using it alone for a few days in November, my skin has rash and is very sensitive and itchy.",4,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Tried it, wanted to love it, but my skin hates it. The 1st day using it everything was fine, next day I broke out with a mild looking, painful rash down the middle of my neck and on my cheeks, it almost looks like a sunburn if you didnt know I tried a new product. It also dried my skin out like crazy to the point if flaking in some spots.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,At first when i tried it my skin was so dry the next day and had a reaction but now when i apply it i dampen my face with a toner and omg its amazing leaves my skin super glowy only bad thing that its not moisturizing enough so i go in with a heavy cream after i would buy againüòä,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I brought this hoping itll truly moisture my skin as it has the snail mucin in it that I normally love. But unfortunately, it did not. I found myself having to apply quite a bit to get some type of moisture on my skin which felt nice. After a little though my skin felt dry again. Not really a big fan. Would stick to the birch sap moisturizer from COSRX instead.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Very disappointed. Product is thin like watered down lotion. It dries down immediately and I have noticed no moisturizing properties. In fact, I think it has dried out my skin!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,perfcet product to my glass skin care routine,3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"if youre like me and never used anything with snail mucin before, youll be shocked when it comes out of the bottle. it is a bit slimey but just trust me, its great. its very light and soaked in nicely while still giving me a natural glassy finish. some say it doesnt work under makeup but I only use it in my nighttime routine. it doesnt feel like something that would work with a makeup routine honestly.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Me and my boyfriend both tried this out from seeing it on tiktok and we both got pimples on our faces that we usually never get so we stopped and the pimples went away. It was really moisturizing wish it actually worked for us. üòì,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Wouldn't buy it again, didn't moisturize very well, and saw no improvement in my skin. Honestly made my skin more dry over time.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,It left my skin so dewy ! As a black sista ! This is really good :) 10/10,3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This stuff is my holy grail! Every time I run out of this stuff and leave it out of my routine I notice huge differences in my skin. Firstly, it makes my skin super soft, if someone touches my face they always mention how soft it is. It also helps amazingly with acne, I dont know why it just does! Helps with the inflamation for sure. And a little goes a long way, I just take a small dab and its enough for my whole face and neck. Def get this, you won't regret it.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I love this all in 1 cream! Its a little pricey but its worth it in my opinion. It last a while too! It sits sk nicley on the skin, very glowy, glads like skin. I have been using this product for at least 6-7 months and i havent been disappointed. Only a few times i broke my skin barrier and my face was very dry and peeling it didnt keep my skin very moisturized, other than that its been great! I use a little more at night than during the day and i wake up and my skin is amazing.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've been seeing how popular COSRX is and decided to give it a shot. I was recently using the ordinary moisturizer and was about done with the tube and decided to upgrade my moisturizer. Best decision I've made. The all in one cream has been very skin friendly to me, all I need is just a pea size amount and it did the job. Very creamy formula; pairs nicely with my serums and sunscreen.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This is such a good step after a serum and before sunscreen! On its own it isn't enough for my combo skin, it's a hydrating water based gel cream so someone really dry needs something more occlusive and rich for sure.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I was excited to try out this moisturizer as I've heard a lot of good things about it! But unfortunately, it wasn't rich enough for me, my skin would feel dry by mid day. I think someone with normal to oily skin would enjoy it more. The texture is light and slightly tacky. It didn't irritate my skin or make my acne worse.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This product is great if you have combination, oily, or normal skin. There are way better options out there if you have dry skin. I also really do not recommend this for anyone with cystic acne. I have combination skin and I love this! Its very lightweight and absorbs very well. I've been using it consistently for over a month and I love the way my skin feels and looks after using in conjunction with the essence. It has a very nice glow without looking or feeling sticky like a few other gel moisturizers I've tried.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"The ""all-in-one"" label made me hope I could streamline my nighttime skincare routine on nights my fatigue is really bad. Not the case. It's a smidge stringy, but I could get past that. What I can not get past is how drying it is. It does nothing for my skin.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Great product for people with oily to normal. It's very lightweight and gel texture. It is not hydrating enough for my dry skin though. Would 100% recommend it for people with oily to normal skin. I was expecting it to be thicker consistency since it is called a ""cream"".",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This product immediately helped my highly reactive skin. No break outs, less redness, and perfect every day moisture for skin that often feels dry.",2,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have normal/oily skin and i feel like this didnt mousturize well. I can see if being a summer moisturizer but even then it doesn't cut it. If you have dry skin, i wouldn't recommend. It keaves your skin feeling as if you didnt even put moisturizer on.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Bought one a few months ago in the jar, and much prefer the new tube packaging. I really enjoy this moisturizer, it is thick enough to make my skin feel fully protected in dry in environments but is not heavy at all. I think it soothes my skin well, but I did initially feel irritated when I first purchased.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I love this! It has made my skin so smooth, it cleared my acne and my acne scars are fading i'm obsessed with this and I use it everyday!",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've heard good things about snail mucin so when it because a 21 days sale item I snatched it up. I definitely WILL buy this on REPEAT without a sale. I don't know what magical element is in it.. oh wait, yes we do - but it's doing AMAZING things for the texture of my face. I'm 60+ btw so there't that! love this!!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,My skin is always dry and I love how hydrating this is without feeling too thick. It does feel a little sticky when putting it on (but less than their essence product) but once it dries I love the softness it gives my skin! It feels like it minimizes fine lines with each use!,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Really hoped to love it because of all the reviews I have seen and I was so exited to use it and it made me break out the day after I used it and I hardly ever breakout and it was one of the worst breakouts I have ever had. But I have oily skin so it might be better for dry skin,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"i love all cosrx snail mucin products! i have very dry, red sensitive skin and this has helped me so much! i bought the snail mucin cleanser, essence, and moisturizer and i love them all! but the cleanser is the most rebought product for me! it foams up nicky and leave my skin clean, fresh, and without that tight draggy feeling i get from some cleaners! it also doesn't sting my eyes",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"i have oily, slightly sensitive skin and this product broke me out and made me itchy :( i wanted to like it really bad but it just wasnt for me! it was, however, very light weight when i did wear it.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I am SO glad I bought 3 tubes while they were on sale. Love using this product especially since it's cruelty free.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I got this on sale they had. I was curious because i wanted to use something soothing, hydrating with my trentinoin. At first use over night my skin felt soooo dry and made my lips dry too. BUT i just needed to READ the proper instructions how to use snail mucin! Use it over damp skin always. I spray my skin Wet and immediately use it over my skin. And oh my goodness my skin is plump, dewy without being greasy! Over the past weeks the fine hydration lines on my face are smoothed out. It pairs so well with my full strength trentinoin, i haven't had irritation. I think people are either using wrong, aren't exfoliating their 2-3 times a week. And are just allergic to snail mucin. When used correctly it is so amazing with amazing benefits!",1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I accidentally purchased this instead of the Snail Mucin essence, but it was a happy accident. I have been using it for almost two weeks & my skin is softer, smoother, and looks brighter. Added bonus is how little product is needed to cover the face and neck.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I got the cream because the store i went to was out of the essence. This product is amazing. I cant compare it to the enssence, but im sure its just as good. All the reviews are correct! First use i feel a difference! I have been using it only at night. The main reason im writing this review is because it has helped with my chapped lipsXD Which is a thing i did not expect. I bite my lips constantly, which makes me want to bit my lips more. Its a never ending cycle. Im not applying this on my lips! Just from it being on my face, its moisturized my lips! I wake up to my lips being completely smooth. Not all scratchy.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I use it twice a day. Morning and night.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I freaking love this stuff! I have dry skin and had been using a $150 moisturizer from a place where I got a facial done. It was good but I didnt want to repurchase something that expensive. I found this and decided to give it a try. I WILL NEVER GO BACK! I love this! My face always feels so smooth, its glowy and looks so much healthier! Mixed with my other products, I rarely break out anymore! The best part is, I don't have to break the bank! I love this stuff! 10/10",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've been using this for about a month on and off. I wasn't really keeping track of its progress and actually thought it wasn't doing anything. But after a while, I noticed my face looked a bit fresher and prettier when I would walk past the mirror. Still I didn't think much of it and didn't correlate it to this product. Fast forward, we go out to eat and I took some selfies. I was quite surprised that my skin looked nice in the photos - no filter was used! I had makeup on, but still my skin never looked very nice with how I put makeup. I finally thought, huh I think that snail cream is working. My boyfriend has also noticed and is now using it on himself. He says he sees the difference and that it works to make the face look smoother and softer. It did not remove my age/brown spots, but definitely made my complexion prettier.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have dehydrated sensitive skin. I purchased this in conjunction with the advanced snail mucin cleanser and the Full Fit Propolis Light Ampoule serum. 30 days later and there has been no change in the fine lines, uneven skin tone, dehydrated look in my skin. It didn't make me break out so I would recommend it for sensitive skin.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,The all in one cream has helped improve my dark spots and also works great as a moisturizer without making my skin oily and it has become an essential / favorite product in my everyday skincare routine!,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have a very greasy t zone and a little dry edges of my cheeks skin. this moisturizer fits perfectly for my mostly oily skin. I already have a skin care routine and just needed a better moisturizer that the one I had. so far so good.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've only been using this for 2 weeks. I can see my brown spots getting lighter. it does do well under your makeup. I usually brush my teeth or wait for 30 seconds first. I don't have to use full coverage concealer or foundation. instead of applying a dew look with makeup it comes from within! I follow the steps for my combo to dry skin and have a lot of redness on my cheeks. its calming and feels smooth also. By the way I'm 61 and have always used high dollar skin care since I could afford it on my own. But I have to say I love Cosrx. as far as a slimy feeling, I didn't notice a thing other that it goes a long way. no scent what so ever. This is cheaper than what I was using, I have to admit I love getting all my free gifts with other skincare. But for now I'm going to finish Cosrx and update you at a later date.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I came in looking for sometbing to help with my dry skin and redness and this has actuallt helped so much. I love to pair this with the intensice hyaluronic cream for added hydration and plumping,4,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have incredibly dry skin and sensitive skin i tried this product for 2 weeks and it completly broke me out multiple tiny bumps allo over my face my face had a bunch of pimpkes after and school is tmr WOULD NOT RECOMMEND,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"As amazing as this stuff is it doesn't really leave my skin as hydrated as I would like it to be, but if you're looking for something that's lightweight and absorbent I would give this a try, but I honestly like their hyaluronic acid intensive cream so much better",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"An ulta employee actually recommended me this when i was looking for the OG bottle everyone is using on tik tok , she said this is the same thing and ‚Ä¶. it really is! i like the fact that its a cleaner bottle and you don't have to stick your hand in but MAKE SURE TO USE ON DAMP SKIN or it wont work!!! i use a small amount of this at night with a moisturizer and wake up glowing!!! Amzing hydration too",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"First I bought the snail mucin essence but was also looking for a new moisturizer so I tried this. At first I was really not into it because my skin is very dry and I am use to applying oil but this 'cream' really grew on me. I love layering it over the snail mucin essence (it's a thicker version of that) Personaly I like the gooey, weird texture.",4,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have a jar of this and can't wait to finish it I hate how slimy it is and just makes me feel gross the way it separates I don't want to waste the jar or snails energy it took to make this but after educating myself on the process I will no longer buy any snail Related products,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This is an amazing moisturizer. As soon as it hits the skin you get intense moisture I haven't had a dry spot or any irritation since using it! It gives the skin this intensely soft plumping effect.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,First off I have really sensitive and red skin and this has helped a lot. Just after a couple days of using I have noticed my skin looks more plump and hydrated even some of my acne scarring has reduced in appearance. I use this after my serums + suspensions and layer on my moisturizer after. I think people might think to use this to replace a moisturizer but this definitely needs another layer of moisturizer on top to really lock the hydration in. I will be buying again!,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've have been jumping from moisturizer to moisturizer since they've all had been giving me rashes, then i found out abt this snail mucin moisturizer, at first i was a little spectacle abt it since everybody had different opinions on it. Around that time i was suffering with a chemical burn from my last moisturizer and hyperpigmentation, at first when i started using this moisturizer i didn't see much progress the first two weeks, but after some time my hyperpigmentation had gotten alot better and the chemical burn had gone away completely and healed it had also helped with my acne and fungal acne. Although its very messy it's still so worth it!! It leaves my face hydrated and sooo glowy! And will definitely repurchase, and for anybody with sensitive skin! This is safe, i have VERY sensitive skin and didn't trigger a rash for me at all. So i would most definitely recommend this to anybody who suffers with acne & fugnal acne , hyperpigmentation,sensitive skin and dry spots!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I use the following with it: The snail serum/toner Hyloronic acid 100% squalene 100% organic rose hip seed oil Jojoba oil THEN I use this ontop for the BEST results!!!,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I love the COSRX Snail Mucin Essence, so I figured I would give the cream a try. I used it for five days, and it dried out my skin so bad that it started flaking. I tried using it on both dry and damp skin, since snail mucin is a humectant, and I had the same outcome with both. I returned it after day 5. I know this product has worked wonders for a lot of people, but I guess it wasn't meant for me. I still use and love the essence, though. For reference, I have combination / acne prone skin.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,tried this out after running out of my cosrx hyaluronic acid moisturizer. couldn't use it on its own without it drying up my skin. had to always use a hyaluronic serum before applying. didn't rly see the snail mucin benefits,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This moisturizer is the only product that has actually helped both acne scars and acne within three uses. After a week, my skin is glowing, my scars have faded tremendously and even fine lines from smoking have tightened slightly. Glycolic acid? Retinol? They have NOTHING on this singular product.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Amazing for my acne prone skin. Feels light weight and easy to apply. I will recommend. I come under sensitive skin so this product I have been using for 1year and never ever have I come across any sort of allergies or pilling.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This product makes my skin so glowy and beautiful!! I'm in love with this cream formula which isn't too heavy on the skin. I can wear this daily, and a little goes a long way! Best snail moisturizer I've ever had! Love this brand",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"i really wanted to love this so bad because i love the snail mucin and thought it would have the same effect (affect?), and it's great when i put it on initially. but after maybe an hour my skin feels dry and tight and there's no more glow",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Horrible! Made my skin extremely dry,i have good skin i wanted to try it as a new moisturizer because i kept seeing it do well with the girlies on Tik Tok. Lesson learned i will continue to use my Albolene and drink water.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I've been using this for about a week and half and I love it! My face doesn't lose moisture. I can use a foundation and my face does look flaky/cakey.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I really tried to love this product, the first few days my skin felt AMAZING, but i started to notice little bumps pop up around my nose and chin and around my mouth. I continued using the product for another month to see if my skin was just purging but the breakouts have continued and are constant. I love the texture of the product, but it doesnt seem to be helping my skin or my breakouts.",1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Ive just started using this cream and i have to admit the texture is a little ""gross"" to me, but it has already started helping with my redness and dry patches. I love it so far!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This product was fone at first. But, i have oily skin and after about 30 minutes after application it made my skin dry and irrated. woukd not reccomend.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I wanted to love this product, but it didnt do much for my dry skin. The main issue though, was that the product would peel off throughout the day. Ultimately, not useable for me, had to return.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Ive had this moisturizer since February (today is July 20th) The jar looks almost full still! You wouldn't believe that i use it every single morning. Only moisturizer ive found that doesn't break me out or worsen any acne i have. Definitely worth the price.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,it is so so moisturizing but make sure to use a generous amount or you won't see any results. after I started using it I no longer had sebum in my nose. I tried switching to the peach slices one but it just didn't work for me AT ALL. 10/10,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've tried the Peach Slices snail mucin toner, but I like this Cosrx product more! I feel like my skin is more plump and moisturized with the Cosrx than the PS. The price rips my heart out, but a little does go a long way so I think it's worth it.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Feels good at first but it literally dries out my skin so badly. Not even a minute after I apply it my skin gets so dry and dehydrated if anything. Its kind of bizarre considering the good reviews it gets. Someone here mentioned they felt their skin tighten, and I agree. Even after I applied my makeup, my face felt tight and looked drier than usual. It also kind of smells like pen ink/ants to me. I tried the jar version too and its the same ordeal so its not even a matter of the bottle having a different formula. Peacchslicess has waaaay better snail gel.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,i LOVE this moisturiser so much!! it's so hydrating and made my skin soft and plump! my only complaint is that it's really slimy & gets messy easily < /3,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This is my third time using this product and it really is the best, if you have really dry skin like me I would recommend only using this in the summer because its super lightweight and sometimes won't be enough for rlly dry skin in the winter, also apply on DAMP skin to reach full benefits",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This is great. Very lightweight and soaks into my skin.,4,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I really wanted to love this because I've tried other snail products and they were bomb. This formula however just doesn't work well with my skin. I immediately broke out in a hive like rash.,4,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"oh my goodness! I have psoriasis and about 2 years ago I had a cancer scare. the stress of that caused a flare up on my face. I tried so many things in my price range to treat it, but nothing helped. it just got worse and worse until I couldn't even wear foundation anymore because it would stick to the patch between my eyes and made it look like my skin was literally peeling. it was so embarrassing. I read a review from someone else who got this for her bf who also had psoriasis and it helped so I jumped and bought the whole line and I'm so glad I did! between using this daily and using a chemical peel once a week, it's actually gone away to the point I can actually wear foundation again! as long as I keep up on it. if I go too long without, the patch gets worse. I have even recommended it to my sister who's psoriasis is even worse qnd it's been helping her too! I haven't noticed a scent. a very little goes a long way. I get just the smallest amount (like barely dipping the pad of my index finger in it) and it covers half of my face. it feels hydrated after and not stiff. unless I use too much. it IS slimey, so be forewarned. snails are also related to mollusks, so if you're allergic, don't use this. I am, but was desperate lol turns out I can't ingest them, but topically I'm okay.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"It's amazing product. I have sensitive skin, acne and dermatitis! This one and serum of the same brand are great! Since I started use it I noticed No acne anymore, and its helpes my dermatitis, leaves my face so moiturize, no smell non greasy and my face looks very hudrated. It takes a while to absorb but it's no problem for me. For sure I am gonna order it again.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Not hydrating as it claims to be. A bit tightening even. It also does not play well with makeup. I am glad I didn't invest into a bigger jar.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Love love love this product! Moisturized my skin to the point that it hasn't been this clear since I was a little kid. Also does not grease up my bangs if I let it sink in before doing my hair, which is perfect!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,The bounce this gave to my skin is amazing. It feels so good going on and I wake up with glowing skin.,3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,so many bad things i have to say about this product‚Ä¶ i was in search of a new moisturizer & decided to try this one out because if its claimed benefits. i have oiky skin so the first night i used after washing my face it dried out my face like CRAZY it felt super tight & dry to the point where if i talked it moved my mouth i felt like my skin was going to crack. it felt like the freaking aztec clay mask üò≠ another thing is it gave me so many bumps/texture on the 3rd day of using. so please beware of this product‚Ä¶,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I bought this because I loved and still use the Snail Mucin Power Essence, but the moisturizer just isn't as good. It goes on and feels really moisturizing, but it absorbs so quickly and ends up feeling like I've applied nothing at all. It may depend on your skin type, I have oily skin on my t-zone but normal everywhere else. If someone asked whether or not they'd buy this product, I'd say it's okay but you can probably find something better at the same or a lower price point.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Recieved this as a gift- I've been using it every night for about a week and WOW. I swear my fine lines are minimized and my skin is plump a glowing!! I seriously reccommend. It's a little sticky but not thick and overbearing.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Love this product, it's so amazing. Makes my skin so soft and dewy. I swear this paired with the Snail Essence is a GAME CHANGER!!!",3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Its good,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Its good,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Very sticky but I feel a little goes a long way. I use some other products to wash and tone my face and then add this on at night. When I wake up all my dry spots are gone and my skin feels so smooth. Can't wait to see how long this jar will last!,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"started my skincare journey more seriously last year. I rarely EVER repurchase an item, if i run out of a moisturizer or toner, im likely to run out and try another. Not this one though. I'm obsessed. Here's what i've observed in my skin since using: - moisturization and a serious glow - smooth appearance when wearing makeup (doesn't pill under other products) - glass skin - minimized fine lines (i was freaking out about my fine lines, between this nightly and a retinol every 3 or 4 nights they are almost gone!!!) - minimzed irritation My skin loves this. The texture is funky, but once you get over it, you will be putting full globs of this on your face and the results are addicting. I have a dry to combo skin type and this is the best moisurizer i have ever tried. Will forever repurchase.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This was a gift after I asked what my daughter was using to make her skin so luminescent. Incredible product- not sticky or heavy, skin laps it up & looks more plump & hydrated",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"So so sad it didnt work for me, I wanted to love it. It dried me out to the point that my skin started flaking. I originally applied it to dry skin but then saw others recommended to apply it to damp/wet skin so I gave it a try in hopes it would be better. Unfortunately it wasnt. I made sure to use the whole thing, more so for my own 'experiment' if you will, so that I could truly give it a try. I will say, even though it didnt do my skin well over time, in the beginning id use it under makeup and it looked really good!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I was so excited to find out they had my favorite sunscreen in a bigger size. The product feels great on my skin.,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,THIS PRODUCT DOESNT CLOG PORES OR GIVE U ACNE ITS GREAT THIS IS THEIR BEST PRODUCT USING IT ON YOUR FACE IS BEST IT ALSO CALMS YOUR SKIN,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I wanted to love this product so bad. I decided I wanted to switch from ceraves moisturizer to something nicer, and unfortunately this was not it. I have oily skin and this somehow managed to dry me out. It makes my skin feel so tight and Ive also noticed it pills with other products.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Cosrx 92 snail cream is one of my holy grail products. The only downside is that is comes in a jar! So happy I can finally purchase this product in a bottle! It would be great if they would make the full size in a bottle but until then I will gladly pay slightly more for less product,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"holy. cow. it has done a full 180 on my skin in only a few weeks! huge noticeable difference. it hasn't clogged my pores, felt heavy, oily or anything. it absorbs so quickly! i even made my mom try it! shoutout to the snails who helped my face!",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,On the days i wear i full face and need added moisture back into my skin i layer this on top of my moisturizer and i always wake ip with plump bouncy skin,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,i was really excited to try this product and it was nice at first but then my face would get super dry once the product absorbed. so i would re apply more and more but then my face would start getting drier and flaking to the point where i could feel my face crack anytime i'd make a facial expression. it also gave me this really weird and intense reaction as shown in the photo below. since i took this product out of my routine it's back to it's glowy self i would never buy this again.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I had glass skin so fastttt, i use this every morning and night and perfect with the ulta rose quartz gua-sha. Both products are perfect together.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,As with the other products everyone seems to be using it. This is worth all the hype. Its not heavy on the skin and a little goes a long way. As someone with oily acne prone skin this didn't contribute to any acne or increased oil production. In conjunction with the essence it seemed to balance sebum production and made my face less greasy. Which in my book deserves 5 stars. Will be purchasing again.,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"While the texture may be off putting to some, a little with this moisturizer goes a long way so it lasts quite a long time. I don't really care about the texture of a product when it produces such amazing restults! I use it at night and my dry skin loves it. I use this and the under eye cream by COSRX as well and my skin has never looked better.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,this made my skin soft and feel clean every time i use it im almost out thinking of repurchasing,2,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"It worked so well for a week, my skin was glowing, soft, supple, and i was in love with this cream. Than the honey moon phace died and the inner portion of my face began to dry out. Conplety itchy and flaking skin, my skin was completely dry. Really sad about the wasted money, and i really whated this crema to wrok for me.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,You must use this on a wet face. I have combination acne prone skin. I used this at night and would wake up with dry skin. Just didn't work for me but the hydrating one is the best.,4.6,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"At first I liked how the product made my skin look and feel, it was very glowy and hydrated. But after a few uses I noticed my skin had a bad reaction to the product, with reddness and visable pores beginning to show. I immediay stopped using the product and had to return it sadly. It also made my skin feel dry and tight as if I didnt put on any moisturizer‚Ä¶.I have heard many postive reviews of this product and I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately it wasn't meant for my skin type. No doubt this product probably works wonders on other skin types, but for those who have sensitive skin I wouldnt reach for this product.",5,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Thought i liked it. Absorb quickly and moisturized my face nicely. I slowly started getting little white bumps all over my face. I had so much texture and finally saw a tik tok where they were saying it gave them a fungal infection on their face. I stopped using it and my face cleared up and became smooth again.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I kept seeing this in my ticktok fyp. And I had to try it out. I loved the feeling and how light and gentle it was, but what sucked was that it just really dried out my skin. I've got dry acne prone skin, and this just wasn't it. And wanted to like it, but it just made my skin a desert almost.",1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This is awesome it makes my skin feel amazing!,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have been using this and the sunday Riley vitamin C serum and I kid you not in one week my skin is completely different. My skin tone is evening out, my texture is slim to none, my skin looks and feel bright and young. I love the texture, there isn't a fragrance as far as I can tell, and it absorbs into my skin very well. 1000/10",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This lotion is great for people with dry or comb skin. I have very oily skin and although I like how it leaves my skin right after using it, it makes my skin oilier. A little goes a long way, I can only use it at nighttime so I don't get too oily.",2,,

Great under makeup, or at night.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"this moisturizer has been my ride or die for years now. the cosrx moisturizer are so good at their jobs and personally i love the goopy feeling while it's being absorbed on my skin. if you don't feel like your skin is getting moisturized it's because you aren't applying correctly! you have to have a wet face, apply ur serums and toners first, and then apply the moisturizer on top! cosrx has videos on how to do this and it's worth the payout! acne goes away skin turns smooth bumps disappear etc etc! i recently switched to try a new moisturizer from pacifica and la roche and they made my dry sensitive skin break out into hives and damaged my skin barrier (dry flakey sensitive skin around eyes and cheeks) and i had to turn back to this routine to get my perfect skin back.",4.6,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I got this moisturizer and I'm in love with it. It leaves my skin so dewy and hydrated. It is light weight, so in the winter months when it's very cold and windy, I layer it with a heavier moisturizer.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have oily skin, with redness around my chin and cheeks. My best friend put me on to this. It's slimy, but it's still lightweight and absorbs well. Using it as a moisturizer, I noticed a flaky/dry reaction around the apples of my cheeks and chin. I started applying the product heavily at night. During the day, a small amount with heavy sunscreen. I'm on week six of use with no more flaky/dry reactions. I recommend using a dime sized amount for day, and at night let your skin get more of the product. Overall, I love this. It's helped my skin so much.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"An amazing powerhouse product. Will absolutely heal any issues you've got going on, zits, etc and leave you with clear moisturized skin. HOWEVER, use this as the last step, almost like slugging. You need a base layer of moisture for this to work, or it will be drying. I use a milky toner, a few essences, sometimes a serum, then this.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I tried this because everyone on tiktok loved it for barrier repair. My skin is super dehydrated from too much exfoliation so I gave it a try. Pros: despite being mucusy it sinks into the skin immediately, a little goes a very long way, it leaves no tacky residue and feels like wearing nothing, the tub is huge and will last a long time Cons: it didn't moisturize at all! In fact my skin felt more dry, even though I applied it on wet skin to help with the hyaluronic acid. I ended up returning it.",5,,

I don't have sensitive skin and I rarely have a reaction to new products. It didn't work out for me but I loved the way it felt on my skin. I will be returning it. I hope my face heals soon.

I have dry skin and this dried out my face even more! After it settled into my skin, I was horrified to see that it made my face look leathery. I'm a firm believer that you need to try a new product for at least 2 weeks before coming to conclusions and I've been using it for a month. The same thing keeps on happening. Also, it doesn't give the ""glass skin"" look if that is what you were going for. I know everyone's skin is different but if you have dry skin, please take my review into consideration! This is my first ever Ulta review.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I really wanted to love this product, I went through the reviews and the products claims; helps with redness, dryness, etc. I thought I found something that would work for me. Been using this product for 3 weeks now, the first week I broke out on my forehead and cheeks but though it was because of my period (i don't normally breakout or have sensitive skin). My skin hasn't cleared up at all and has stayed the same.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,this stuff has absolutely changed the game for me. especially in these winter months. it's adds so much glow and life into the skin. it builds easily with my other products and really just soothes my face. recommending it to everyone,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This product is honestly hard to use. It kinda reminds me of slime and it somehow makes a mess everywhere when I use it. I could look past that if it actually did anything for my skin but it's abt the same level as Cerave. It's just basic.,2,,

Returning!",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Honestly, all it does is dries out your skin. I have oily skin, so I thought it'll help with that. It did, but it was too much for my skin.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have been looking for a moisturizer that I love and this is it. it perfectly moisturizes my skin and doesn't leave any stickiness. I have very dry skin so it soaks it up and I can do multiple layers of it without stickiness and keeping my skin hydrated.,1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,not sure if it was something I ate or if was this lotion. i tried this on my skin at night and in the morning I had a rash on my lower chin. I didnt add anything new to my routine apart from this,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I was super excited to use this product because I had seen it recommended highly online, but I only used it a handful of times and it messed up my skin pretty badly. I used it a night for a few days and I woke up with bright red cheeks, not sure if it was a rash or just badly irritated, and was shocked. Will be returning and would not recommend, especially for those with sensitive skin.",4.6,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"God, ok yes, snail mucin really is that good. My ego is crushed. Something in me never wants something so popular to be so good, but alas, here we are. The texture is fun and applies SO WELL. The result is beautiful, moisturized skin with a nice glow to it. It is feels protective for my skin, especially in the winter weather I'm experiencing right now. So yes, put your pride aside and buy it, because it totally rocks.",1,,

This moisturizer is not for people who have the same skin type as me. It dried out my skin and didn't last long at all. BUT what I thought was great about this product, it's that my t-zone area was not oily at all! I also haven't had any breakouts with this product, and my skin does look more even (just dry). I've used this moisturizer for 4 days (morning and night) and I think this product would be great for people who have oily skin, or for the summer time. But as winter moisturizer, may not be the best. The texture is strange. Really slimy, but once it settles in, it's not so bad.",5,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I recently started a medication that's drying for my skin and wanted to start the extra hydration process, before my I got super dry. I love this Corsx all in one cream. The consistency is thin, and it doesn't feel sticky after application. It is pretty elastic when you scoop some out of the jar so it will stretch. You may need to wipe excess on the rim of the jar before applying. My skin doesn't feel weighed down, and I use it as the first layer of hydration before I put on a night cream at night or sunscreen in the morning. It's also helped to soften my skin.",4.6,,

So an Ulta employee told me to try this or Beekman. Oh my gosh. I love this stuff. I have combo skin and this makes my face feel like a baby's booty. I love it so much that I even bought the essence and eye cream. Those are also both great! The eye cream isn't too thick and takes my dark circles away perfectly.

But I was so blown away by this cream, I had to write one. My skin looked amazing after just one use. I put it on before bed, and woke up to glowing, soft skin with my acne scarring looking significantly better than it had just 12 hours before. After a few weeks now of using it morning and night, I can confidently say I will never use another moisturizer. I never thought that glass skin was possible for me, and this product has given that to me! I get compliments on my skin all the time now, I've even started using it on my inner thighs after shaving. I normally get insanely bad razor burn there and break out in hives if I try to use any sort of lotion. I haven't had a single bit of irritation or redness now! I also have no issues using it under makeup. I allow it to absorb into my skin for 5-10 minutes before applying sunscreen and my foundation/base makeup sits perfectly on it all day. I will shout from the roof tops about this cream for the rest of my life. I have always been insecure about my skin, and now I could cry at how amazing it looks!!",5,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"So far I'm on day two of using this and I love it! Thank you to the awesome little snails for sharing their goo with us! It's made my skin dewy and soft and I can already tell that using it long term will bring anti aging benefits. If your on the fence, give it a try!",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I only use it once a day and my face does have a glow already! My combination skin loves it. It moisturizes my dryness within leaving my face greasy looking. I've used more expensive snail mucin products before, so the price point is a bonus as well! I definitely will buy this again!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I love this product for its hydrating properties and use it as a humectant, since it's basically a hyaluronic acid serum with more benefits. I will say that the only negative is that it dries down quickly and leaves my skin dry if I don't put another moisturizer on top of it, and I recommend using this product as a serum then something else as your actual moisturizer.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,My skin has changed from oily to combination (and on the drier side). I've seen this product on social media and decided to try it. I'm slowly trying to incorporate more Asian beauty products in my routine since I have Asian skin. The only caveat is that I also religiously use my Curology prescription which has a retinol. This product definitely didn't moisturize my face enough on my retinol nights. It dried out my nose and cheek area so badly that my skin would peel throughout the day. My coworkers thought I had a bad sunburn on my face and it was peeling :( I wanted to like this product but I think I'll be finding a new nighttime moisturizer with my curology prescription.,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"i normally don't write reviews but i got this product because the mucin essence was sold out and i love this product. i use this and then put a moisturizer on top because it does dry out your skin if you don't use a moisturizer with it. it makes makeup look better and hydrates so well. didn't cause any breakouts for me. only con is the container, it does get a little messy trying to use it but overall this product is amazing!",5,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Used it on my daughter for her eczema. Very moisturizing, loved the consistency & was light on sensitive skin.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,My friends was normal to oily skin absolutely love this and said it changed the face completely it does say for all skin type so I went to try it as I'm used to the Touch of cream but since it's so expensive I figured this would be more cost-effective unfortunately it's just not moisturizing enough is the only con definitely would not recommend if you have dry skin even if it's only a little dry like mine you put the moisturizer on and you can just feel your skin be thirsty afterÔøº,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've been buying the all in one cream for years. I actually first tried the snail line using the essence and actually felt my skin didn't react well to it, however, the all in one cream for whatever reason works really well with my skin (at first I thought it was a snail issue so that's why I was surprised). I've used it both AM and PM, but if you're like me and like to put a pretty big glob of moisturizer on when you moisturize, this one does take a minute to sink in, so I prefer to wear it at night. On the mornings I do wear it, I have to make sure I don't throw it on and run out the door, I have to remind myself it needs a few minutes so my mask doesn't get wet either. Overall, I still love this product and it's really my tried and true. It never clogged my acne prone skin and I always wake up feeling like I have soft skin because of it! I do also use this in a routine that includes retinol and my skin has always felt safe/non-irritated and I'm sure this plays a part.",2,,

My skin is oily and combo in some parts. I'm 27 years old. To give context to future users. I use the product morning and night. NEVER had an issues with this product.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"My skin barrier was extremely damaged from overusing retinoids. I had heard amazing things about snail mucin in general so I initially went in looking to purchase the essence but it was sold out and decided to try the cream instead - zero regrets! This thing (along with a few other items) resurrected my skin. It's super light and absorbs quickly. It definitely leaves my face feeling plump and glowy. I always add a moisturizing SPF on top and my skin never feels dull. Also, one jar lasts for months!",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have extremely sensitive oily skin and this feels great and doesn't break me out. I wish it came with a pump it would really help! It's messy but hey it's snail secretion what do you expect!

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I purchased this product three months ago. I was absolutely unsure how I was going to feel about it.However - I was absolutely impressed. Don't let the price make you feel like its a cheesey product.. It soaks into your skin nicely - it's not greasy- No nasty sticky feeling what so ever.. It's a perfect extra - on hand beauty product too have.. The price is simply a bonus..,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,this helps my skin look and feel soft and glowy. i am a more oily gal but i can hardly see my oiliness with this on. i use my usual light makeup over it and it just makes my skin look so much better! applying my powders also felt smoother.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This product makes my skin so soft and glowy. I only wear it overnight as it gets a little funky if you try to mix stuff with it or later on top of it.,3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've been eyeballing this product for a while now. I've gone through multiple moisturizers but something within my skin has changed recently and my face has become extremely oily especially around my nose. No matter what I've tried, everything made it worse. I even had to give up my holy grail products. So I finally gave in and gave this a try and I absolutely love it! I won't lie, it is‚Ä¶ different, especially from the typical moisturizer. The consistency is super weird, but if you can look past that I don't think you'll be disappointed. After a week my skin is no where near as oily and looks so much more radiant. I will say, I do not think this product is a good fit for someone with dry skin. I think this is better suited for oily skin, as it does have a tightening effect that may not be what someone with dry skin is looking for. Also, for the price, you get so much product and a very small amount goes a long way. This jar will definitely last awhile.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This stuff is amazing! I'm on my second tub. I make sure I apply it to damp skin and it takes a minute to skink in but it does not feel heavy at all and leaves my skin super soft. At night I do the same thing and put squalane oil on top.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"i expected to be blown away, but this just made my face more itchy & sensitive, definitely need something more hydrating curious if the essence is better",2,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"So I was really skeptical about this stuff. I mean who would willingly put snail snot on their face, right? Well, for the past few years I've had dry skin, like crypt keeper dry. Nothing was working. I stumbled on an article about this stuff and figured I'd give it a try. Oh wow, y'all! It really works! My skin feels so smooth! The trick is to put it under your moisturizer, twice day. Fair warning though: it looks gross when you open it, but really and truly worth it!",2,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"If you have used the essence and wanted to try this out too, note that it'll be way stickier, tackier, and will have the consistency of glue when applying.

So far, it has worked just as well for me as other snail mucin products but takes some getting used to with consistency.",1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"i never write reviews tbh but my skin is super sensitive and acne prone and this helped hydrate my dehydrated skin. i usually break out after using moisturizers except for my vanicream moisturizer but it can become too heavy for my oily skin but with this cream i can slug so much on and i'll be fine. i don't even need to use much. the only downside is tht it's messy but i don't mind since i wake up with hydrated , glowy skin. it also reduced the breakouts i get around and in between my eyebrows and it's only been 3 days",4.6,,

Lady at Ulta told me I should try this one since I liked the hyaluronic acid cream. Terrible idea. This is NOT a dry skin cream. 10 minutes after applying this my face was crazy dry, tight, uncomfortable, and for some reason STILL sticky. I tried using it a few more times and it just felt so awful. Ive never had a more drying cream at this price point. I had to return it. Definitely going back to my old cream once it comes back in stock.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I absolutely LOVE this product and the whole line! I have combo skin (mostly oily) and all the snail products do wonders on my face. My acne has cleared up significantly and I'm moisturized but not overly where I feel so oily and gross. The products are light on my skin and I can't get enough!!!,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Wanted to love this. Been eyeing it for years and finally decided to try it when the 21 days of beauty rolled around. I have dry skin and have issues with it feeling tight and well this didn't help relieve it at all. Wasn't moisturizing enough for me. Felt good at first but my skin felt a little tight after a while and I didn't like that.,1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I got this in replacement for the essence and I honestly like it more! The texture will take some getting used to and although it super moisturizing at first once it dries I always put another moisturizer on top.,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I had damaged my skin barrier with some retinoids and picked this up to try and get some moisture back and repair my skin. It has been extremely helpful and I credit it for not only helping my skin barrier but also my foundations have been applying so much smoother. I use the essence during the day and this at night. Neither have a smell. Both are thick but spread easily and feel great on the skin. Highly recommend.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have dry skin and it made it worse. My skin felt tight and even started peeling after I put it on.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I'm enjoying my Advanced Snail 92 by Cosrx. I just wish I could have got the serum on the 50 % off But the store was out.,5,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,It doesn't give me enough moisture I like to layer it with a water based moisture to give me that juicy glowy skin! But it works good,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Not all alcohols are bad. Take it from an Esthetician ü§öüèΩ hi! This one is a fatty alcohol so it's quite moisturizing üëçüèΩ I love this cream. I prefer the essence only because it has a pump.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've gone through a few of these and love it! I was surprised at some of things negative reviews but I think I've figured it out. I've always used this as a nighttime moisturizer and top it off with an oil or some healing ointment, and I never found it to be drying at all. After looking at the ingredients, this product is high in humectants but low in occlusives. Humectants retain water, and occlusives seal it in to prevent evaporation. So it worked well for me because I was adding that extra occlusive layer on top, which is a good idea at nighttime in dry climates regardless of the product you're using. Also, I saw some comments about cetearyl alcohol- cetearyl alcohol is very different from normal alcohol and it's nit drying at all, which is why it's allowed in products labeled ""alcohol-free"". Hope this helps",2,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I actually purchased this years ago and I wasn't a fan of it at first because it has a slightly tacky texture due to the snail mucin. I never threw it out because I'm a college student and don't want to waste the money I worked hard to earn. About 2-2.5 years later, my skin barrier broke due to excessive use of retinoids. I couldn't get my skin to heal no matter what I tried. I found my old container of this cream and decided to just give it a shot. It worked! After weeks with a broken skin barrier, this cream completely healed my skin in just a few uses! Definitely one of my all-time favorite creams now. Even my dad likes it. He has dry skin and he says the snail mucin gives him such a nice glow and makes him feel young again.",4.6,,

I never threw it out because I'm a college student and don't want to waste the money I worked hard to earn. About 2-2.5 years later, my skin barrier broke due to excessive use of retinoids. I couldn't get my skin to heal no matter what I tried. I found my old container of this cream and decided to just give it a shot. It worked! After weeks with a broken skin barrier, this cream completely healed my skin in just a few uses! Definitely one of my all-time favorite creams now. Even my dad likes it. He has dry skin and he says the snail mucin gives him such a nice glow and makes him feel young again.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have combination, acne prone skin and I love this moisturizer!! My skin always looks so smooth and I hardly breakout when I use it. The only downside is is can be drying on the dry parts of my skin.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I use to use biopelle moisturizer with snail secretions. It works amazing but it will break the bank at about 80-100 jar. I use this but only at night to refresh and rehydrate. Helps prevent and may even get rid of smaller fine lines. It has helped with mine. I would not recommend to wear for day use or under makeup. I don't think it was intended for that anyway. For reference I am in my 43 I have combination skin. But I've always maintained a good skin care routine. Key is prevention. This doesn't well for that. Make sure hands are clean before applying so you aren't introducing bacteria into the jar. I have tried the essence and I do not like it. It makes me break out with acne. If you have sensitive skin I would recommend this over the essence. The essence makes me break out. It's more like a serum.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,My akin is sensitive and the combination type. This made my very skin dry. I also developed little bumps on my face. The essence worked perfect with my skin so this was a waste of money to try,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have dry skin, and eczema, and I was having really bad dry skin all over my face for weeks, and I started using this moisturizer and the serum in the same line, and within 2 days my skin was so moisturized and so soft and Plump. I use it as a mask",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I've been religiously moisturizing with rose hip seed oil for the last 6 years but lately have had patchy areas. I wanted something more moisturizing and tried all the hyaluronic acid creams and niacinamide you name it nothing helped. Then I bought the cosrx eye cream and it was so smooth and hydrating I caved and bought this too. It's been AMAZING. My face feels like a new born babies butt lol smooth AF. So soft and stays hydrated all day. A little goes a long way and I haven't even touched my Rosehip seed oil since I bought this.,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I put this over my thicker moisturizer. I get a small amount and put it on my acne prone skin and sensitive skin. I wake up in the morning and I already see a difference. I tend to pick at my skin so I put this over the pimples I picked at, and they're already healed in the morning. Love it üòçüëå",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,The perfect moisturizer & the only one that's ever made such a noticeable difference with my skin!! It makes my skin look and feel super glowy but not sticky and absorbs in so well instead of sitting on top of my skin like other moisturizers.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I just got this 2 days ago, used it morning and night for 2 days and i can already see a huge difference in my skin. LOVE IT.",1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Made my skin dryer!,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I use this after I wash my face underneath a thicker moisturizer to lock in moisture. The water at my house was really drying me out and causing my skin to be very red and break out BAD. I picked this moisturizer up along with the Cerave moisturizer and I have been using the two together, morning and night. My skin cleared up almost immediately and is softer than ever!! I will be using this combo forever",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Was so excited to try after reading the description that said the formula had no alcohol but after reading the ingredients, there is Cetearyl Alcohol in it :( Sensitive skin beware!!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"So this was the online item I changed in my everyday makeup routine. And it immediately broke me out, it gave me deep cystic acne when I never get acne like that. And I have combination skin, and had never had such a bad reaction before . I'm still trying to get my skin to recover from it",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have very dry skin especially in the winter time. I try high end products and low end, but rarely find anything that quenches my Skin. I thought this product was decent prize for jar you get. Yes, it does feel slimy and takes a minute to get use to. But once I apply it to my face, it drank it up. My skin is glowing and no more dry patches. It has held up so far with a cold December. I rarely repurchase a product and I am about to buy my third jar!! You won't regret this if you have dry skin. My makeup also applies well with this.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have super dry and sensitive skin. I have been using HA after washing my face for the past few years and made the switch to this product a few weeks ago. My skin feels amazing. It is able to hold moisture so much better than with any other product I've ever used. 10/10 truly.,3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I'm 46 with combination skin and I live in a very dry climate, so my skin needs a lot of moisture. And I found that this cream isn't nearly as hydrating as the Cosrx Hyaluronic Intensive Cream. It feels really nice going on, but my skin starts getting thirsty within the hour. Might work for oilier skin types or those in more humid areas, though.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"i had a problem with dry skin for the first time in my life this winter and i have no idea why. it's not like the humidity is any different, i haven't changed anything etc. anyways, nothing was working. i tried facial oils, hyaluronic acid, anything and i was still so dry. every time i put on makeup it was caking up and it was terrible which i've never dealt with before. i bought this from ulta after seeing it on tiktok (lol), went home, washed my face, used this and woke up the next morning with literally a 90% improvement of how my skin was before. this is the ONLY thing i put on my face before makeup and my makeup went on PERFECTLY for the first time in literally a month of dry skin. just buy it",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"My skin is combo and can get more dry in the winter. So far since it's been cold and my face has been more on the drier end, using this has kept my skin hydrated! I use this and a moisturizer on top of it, I recommend trying this trick if you want your skin to be glowing and soft.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"leaves my face feeling dry & tight. maybe it would be okay if you used it like a serum under a moisturizer but this is supposed to be an ""All in One Cream"" so??? Definitely not worth the money. i find more value in the jar it comes in than I do the cream",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,It made my skin so so dry. Would not recommend this to anyone. After looking at the reviews I got excited but my skin is now super dry and flaky and red from this product. I have sensitive skin and this exasterbated it.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,My skin loves this product very much. I'm Normally dry and this is a gel product yet my skin stays hydrated all night until morning. I love it and this is my second time purchasing the product.,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I do have sensitive, oily skin and this product gave me one of the worst breakouts I've had in many years! My forehead,cheeks, and chin all broke out in acne. I was so sad I had to go get a script from a DR to clear it all back up. Returned",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"My skin LOVES this stuff. It's especially great for helping my skin recover when it's irritated, breaking out, etc. I've been alternating between this product and the snail 3ssence depending on the season. In the winter, I layer this under a night cream. In the summer, I use the essence instead. I've also successfully used this as a standalone moisturizer in the summer and really enjoyed it!",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I love the snail essence soo much ! so I wanted to try this cream hoping it would be just as amazing as the essence but I've been using it for a couple of days now and it's soo drying even after putting another layer of a thicker moisturizer, my skin felt dry and really tight :/",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have oily skin and this made it feel super soft and smooth but woke up the next day to pimples all over my chin, upper lip, and around my nose.I've never had this problem with a product and I rarely ever breakout. My skin was so scaly and red in the morning I have never reacted this badly to a product before. I did use a moisturizer on top of it and still ended up drier than the Sahara.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Do NOT recommend. This moisturizer was promising when I first opened it because it seemed very moisturizing. Within an hour of using it my skin was already dry and flaky. After a few days of using this product I got Contact Dermatitis. My face became covered in small bumps and scaly patches and became itchy. Nothing in my routine changed besides using this product and it started to get better a few days after I stopped using it.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,It is super moisturizing. I love the way it feels on my skin. I am going to try the other products from this line.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,My skin was always dry and dull since I've been using this for my nighttime skincare it makes a world of difference I wake up skin soft face plump now when I'm going to apply my makeup on my skin it kinda blurs everything out,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,It's funny how people say this makes their skin drier or tight! Same with hylaronic acid. As a moistirizer alone yes that would happen. You are suppose to have a damp face while applying most hylaronic acid products.Helps with sticky tacky sensation as well. However most importantly... make sure you add a thicker moisturizer/occlusive over the top to keep it all in..hylaronic acid pulls moisture I'm and will suck it up from your face without being sealed in.. Noww try it.. you will be happy.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I use a ""sandwich"" method for retinoids (light moisturizer --> retinoid --> heavy moisturizer), and this snail cream has been great in the first moisturizer step!‚ù§Ô∏è This lasts a long time, and it feels fantastic going on. It didn't do anything revolutionary on its own, but when my skin is irritated and I'm looking for a simple, gentle, light moisturizer for a great value, this is what I reach for.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"The consistency is indeed snail trail, and my face felt like it had just been pushed through the birthing canal, but when I awoke in the morning I had the complexion of a newborn baby!",5,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have combo skin with rosacea and broken blood vessels on my cheeks. This product absorbs and cools instantly. Snail mucerin seems to be a magical.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"listen, this product is seriously so amazing and moisturizing. i use it as an extra form of moisturizer because the air is dry and my skin loves it! my normal routine is cocokind vitc serum and then just the cosrx suncream but when i add this‚Ä¶ its just unbeatable.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"My skin really loves this product. I stopped using my 150.00 face cream for this. I'm saving money and my skin looks younger, smoother and more plump. I'm a BIG fan of this skin care line. It's a hidden secret, unlock the skin you where meant to have.",5,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This cream is perfect for my skin in summer. I use it day and night and it make my skin look like glass. Does not break me out.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I love the water gel creams but my skin is starting to need more moisture as I enter my late 20s. I bought this after James Welsh on YouTube was talking about it and I'm glad I did! He warned that you don't need to use very much and that is the key to loving this product! Maybe like a pea sized amount - especially if you're using other serums underneath. My makeup sits fine over it when I use the right amount but if I use too much it does get goopy,1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"A co worker mentioned this snail cream and she got me curious about it so I purchased it at ulta beauty and I'm obsessed! I have combination skin and I have browns spots from sun damage. I started using it a week ago and my skin looks more brighter, plump and it's glowing! I can't wait to try the COSRX essence‚ú®",1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I wanted to love this product but it didn't work for me. Initially when I put it on it was very moisturizing but this alone cannot moisturize my skin, and I have normal skin. It's more like a gel-like serum and pills under my sunscreen. I had to return it.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"As someone with sensitive combination skin, this is the only moisturizer that moisturizes my skin without making my T-zone oily or making me break out. I love the lightweight feel, and it mixes well with the vitamin C serum I use in the morning!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This made my pores huge after 1 use!!! First and last time using it. My pores were never an issue for me, i just wanted to try this moisturizer. But it made my pores horrendous, ive never seen them look so bad in my life. Its a day later and im still trying to fix them. Wont be using ever again.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"After lots of positive recommendations, I purchased this last week and started using it 4 days ago. After just a few minutes, it leaves my skin at least as dehydrated as it was before I applied it. I think the hyaluronic acid in it is the culprit. (Dirty little secret: hyaluronic acid is actually a dehydrator if you live in a drier climate.) I have to apply more moisturizer over it to keep from feeling dry. Plus, even when I do that, it leaves my under-eye are looking crepe-y and wrinkly. This stuff is also slimy and messy. Trying to get a dollop out of the jar leaves, well, s snail trail over the rim and onto the counter. I had high hopes and I'm tossing this almost full jar out.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I was excited to try this based on all the positive reviews, but it was so drying on my skin! I gave it several tries, but each time my skin felt dry and tight after just a few minutes. I have somewhat oily skin, so this surprised me.",4,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Absolutely love this cream. I used retinoids that dry out my skin and with one use I could see a huge difference in my skin's appearance. My skin was very soft the next day.,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I can't rave about this product enough, it far surpasses any moisturizers I've used in the past. I live in Florida, so lotion type moisturizers often feel too thick and make my T zone look super oily throughout the day. I loveee how lightweight this moisturizer feels and it keeps my skin soft and glowy without looking oily. Also, I have veryyyyy sensitive skin so the simple ingredients are perfect for me because I never have to worry about them making me break out! My Only complaint is that the consistency does make it a little messy to put on, so I'd love if they came out with this moisturizer in some kind of tube that makes it easier to dispense the product. Otherwise, I can't recommend it enough!!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Love this as my night cream. Use it with the snail mucin vest combo ever,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This moisturizer is great! I love the silky feel and just feels like a veil over the skin. I will add if you have extremely dry skin I will say you might find this not being enough. I'm more dry normally and sometimes I find myself having to put more on. (Which is ok) overall it's an amazing product, I'm an esthetician and actually recommend this to my clients. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it is very messy when you first open it. the product is very ""slimy"" hence the snail, just be careful when using it the first couple times because you will get it over your contour or hands. Overall great product, will continue to recommend and use personally.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have combination skin and when the seasons change my skin drys out around my mouth and starts to peel and get darker. but this moisturized my skin fast and kept it moisturized.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Super hydrating! I wake up and my face physically looks more plump‚Ä¶.and it lasts all day‚Ä¶ (I have normal with an oily t-zone) I noticed that it reduced some redness from acne I've picked at, too. I read somewhere that it has a small amount of naturally occurring chemical exfoliant found in snail mucin. Emphasis on gentle, so you're not going to get noticeable exfoliating effects from this over night. It's very hydrating but if you live in a climate where the air is low humidity, you might want to top it with more of an occlusive agent ‚Äî something to lock in the moisture. This guy pairs well with pretty much any other moisturizer so you can layer it easy. This is a perfect moisturizer for the summer. Wears amazing under makeup too. Just make sure to let it dry down some before applying.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I continue to repurchase this moisturizer because it works better than any other I've tried.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,It makes my skin soft and you use very very little,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I've been using this product for a week and it hydrates my skin better than any other product I've used. My skin feels soft and plump. I struggle with redness around my nose and it has been significantly reduced. I can finally leave my house without having to apply foundation to conceal the redness. Highly recommend!,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Obviously I know that no two faces are alike, even your own from day to day. As for me, though, this gel cream is my unicorn. My IT cream, my holy grail. I'm 43 years old and I have sensitive, dry skin with burst capillaries on my cheeks. My face always feels rough and I have tried SO many things to just have comfortable, glowing skin. I use this cream in conjunction with the propolis toner (first) and propolis ampoule (second) every night and on some mornings. The consistency of the gel cream does take a little while to get used to, but the benefits are just lovely. It absorbs easily, doesn't leave a greasy or tacky feeling once it's fully dry, and smells like absolutely nothing at all. For the first time in my adult life I'm left with skin that feels comfortable and looks nice enough to leave the house without wearing foundation. A little mascara and BB cream and that's it. I'm so happy I found this stuff, and if your skin sounds Ike mine I totally recommend giving it a shot. Especially at this price point!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Unfortunately this cream broke me out really badly. It left my skin feeling dehydrated and dry. Caused bumps and breakouts to form all over my face and neck. Definitely don't recommend.,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I enjoy this moisturizer, a little goes such a long way. At first I felt it didn't moisturize enough but after my skin got used to it I couldn't believe how moisturizing it truly is. But it does make you shiny during the fry especially if you're oily like me but I still like it!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Length of Product Use: Almost a year Description: This cream is very moisturizing with a unique 'slimy' or 'stringy' consistency that really locks in hydration. Almost feels like a hybrid of a cream and gel. With this unique consistency, a little product can go a long way and still packs in plenty of hydration. Spreads and absorbs easily. Does not smell like anything and dries on skin leaving a healthy and hydrated glow. Lasts all day and leaves the skin feeling plump and elastic as per the description. My experience: My skin is normal to slightly sensitive, and dries out in the winter while getting oilier in the summer. I've used this year-round with no issues even when layered with moisturizing oils, mineral sunscreens, and makeup. Keeps my skin feeling fresh without any greasy heaviness. Results: This cream keeps my skin happy and hydrated and a little product goes a long way. Great price for the results. I've tried many other products and so far this one is the best! My holy grail daily moisturizer. Especially great in the winter when my skin dries out. I would only say not to slather too much on as it may dry slower and cause breakouts. Overall very pleased with this CosRX product! IMO best for normal to dry skin.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I love entire CosRx line it's truly life changing. I'm 44 and have been using high end products my entire life but lately my skin just looked tired, dry and unpolished. I switched and now I used everything CosRx right down to the blemish patches and in about 35 days my skin was renewed. It's moderate/high priced but well worth it, you just use a small amount.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,A WAY better gel like moisturizer than the Neutrogena hydro boost I'd been using. This also does not sting or irritate my skin after doing at home acid peels. Also doesn't have an chemical fragrance to it,4,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I wanted to love this product after reading amazing reviews on snail filtrate and even after purchasing. I used for about a month by itself for about two weeks then along with my other serums and products. I noticed on my jaw and cheeks to have more pore congestion which was definitely more noticeable over time with this product. I have complicated skin for lack of a better definition. I won't blame the product but definitely not for everyone,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Please be careful before using this product and patch test first to see if you have snail mucin allergy. I got hives like allergy ALL over my body and it was awful. This is the only product I introduced and the rash went away once I stopped using. It was perfect for my oily, sensitive and acne prone skin though ): I was matte all day and night while glowing. My skin looked so healthy and clear but too bad I'm allergic.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"COSRYX is now my favorite skin care line. This moisturizes like no tomorrow. And you only need a little bit to slather on yr face, neck, decolletage, hands, arms. AMAZING product!",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I use twice a day for about a month now. It has evened out my skin tone, even the dark circles under my eyes. Definitely will buy again",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"If you're looking for dewy, glass skin you need this product. Snail mucin works wonders for my skin and I swear by cosrx's snail line. My only complaint is that it doesn't travel well. It ends up getting messy if it's not constantly upright and perfectly still",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This makes my skin feel moisturized and dewy all day long. I even see a positive difference in my skin tone after 1 week of use! The only downside is it makes my eye area feel really dry and tight after a couple hours of wear,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,it does not keep my dry skin moisturized at all. may be better for people with oily or normal skin but definitely not dry skin.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,i used the essence and then this and it felt really moisturizing going on but once it was dry i didnt feel like i was moisturized enough. It actually felt like it made my skin really dry and i normally have combo/oily skin.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This is one of the brands that get snail goo without hurting the snails. They just let the snails slide around on a cloth which captures the goo without hurting the snails. Some brands do not take that care. Great product to use when doing something irritating like micro-needling or retinol bc it is so healing.,3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"My friends thought I was insane to try any ""snail"" products. Well, not anymore. I've been using this for months and I've seen a huge difference in my skin. It looks much healthier with an inner glow. Even my skeptical friends have admitted that it's worked wonders on my 66 year-old skin. In fact, I'm going to buy another jar of it tomorrow.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This stuff does things to my skin that I've never seen before. the glow is WOW. It is so gentle and calming while being SO NOURISHING. I have combo dry skin and I'm usually super dry other than my nose and chin, so its hard to find something that keeps me hydrated all day. this is it. love it.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"It's a little slimy and sticky looking, but it spreads over my face just how I want it to. I usually put 2-3 layers on my skin (letting it soak into my skin after each layer). It's really helped my skin after moving from SC to AZ. My skin got severely dry and was flaking really bad so I had to change up my whole routine. This stuff has really helped repair my skin. Might be a little too oily for those with oily skin, but most of my face is dry (besides my t-zone) and my face has really taken a liking to this cream.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,It doesn't dry out my skin if I put it on while my face is still wet after cleansing. May as well put it in a pump and call it a serum lol. I like it personally I wouldn't recommend to oily skin,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Perfect daily product to use after you cleanse. It spreads easily across your face and it is smooth with no odor. A little goes a long way for sure. I used it daily and I used one jar (3.5 oz) for nearly 9months,3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"ive had this cream for almost 9 months and though the texture seemed thick at first, i no longer notice that quality. in fact it's very lightweight and spreads effortlessly over the skin and has begun to function perfectly as an everyday moisturizer for me. i felt compelled to write a review after turning to this product after experiencing irritation on two separate occasions and using this as a way to calm burning and itching. my mom also started using this cream at my recommendation and it's the only cream that truly worked to calm her chronic allergy rash and inflammation. the quality of ingredients is amazing for the price. i gave away my perricone HA moisturizer because i was so irritated that it underperformed against this cream. cosrx is really a great example of a super high quality *affordable* brand.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I love this moisturizer and have love it (and all of CosRx snail products for years). This moisturizer is perfect on its own in the summer, but I use Exederm moisturizer under this in the winter. I have extremely dry skin, type 2 rosacea and horribly reactive skin. This has always been great. It's so gentle and makes my skin so clear and smooth. A good tip (for those who say this is so drying), put it on your face when your skin is still damp from cleansing. You should really do that with all of your products except actives....it helps lock the moisture into your skin! I will continue to purchase this moisturizer over and over and over again. It's great!",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I had no reactions which is great and my skin looked beautiful after putting this on but after a while my skin became very dry, so dry it itched (my skin itches when dried out, it's not a reaction to the item). Will only use again if it's an emergency.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I really wanted to like this product.. It felt very hydrating at first but soon my skin became irritated, dry and flaky. I have oily/combo skin and never had this issue before. Once I stopped using it my skin went back to normal.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I really wanted to like this product, because I love COSRX, and it had very good reviews‚Äîbut after trying it day and night for a week, I had to return. Aside from the somewhat difficult and messy application (due to the slimy texture), this product did not work for my combination skin. After applying, my skin looked dewy and felt hydrated, but a few hours after the product soaked in, my skin felt tight and dehydrated. May be useful for individuals with oily skin.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Purchased this moisturizer for the first time in store. Use it am and pm. Have had no problem with my sensitive skin,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Within days after my first use, I noticed that my skin was getting irritated whenever I put this on. It caused me to breakout on my chin and I noticed my skin was getting more and more dry with each use. It felt like it was moisturizing when I first applied it, but as it sank into my skin, it felt as if it was sucking all of the moisture out of my face. I gave it a week, but sadly had to return it, as my skin was so worn out from it.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I love this product so much that I now have my husband, two daughters and my son in law hooked on it!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I go through several of these a year. It helps with healing and plumps up my skin. This is a gel so not as longlasting a moisturizer as some. I add some active essential oils. I keep this bedside and pat a bit onto any dryness as needed. Love love love it.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I'm using it on my chest to try to clear up some of the sun damage that has been done over the years. So far, it feels great on my skin. The lady who helped me pick this out gave it rave reviews!",3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This is life changing. Texture is gone, tone improved & hydration levels have been restored.",1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"A little goes a LONG way, and it feels so calming and moisturizing on my skin. I'm so happy with this cream!",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I was so worried about this breaking me out because I have super irritable combination skin. But no, this is the only moisturizer that has prevented my skin from drying out to the point of bleeding this winter. It feels amazing and I love using it every morning. This was on my TikTok for you page and I'm so glad I bought it. Makes me face feel AMAZZZINGGGGGGG.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I used this cream for two weeks and loved it! I like the gel like texture it's refreshing and feels nice. But by the third week and a half I noticed I started breaking out on my forehead which never happens so I returned it. I have oily skin, it gets dry and stiff during the winter though.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have bad winter dry skin. This was praised a lot for it's miracles. But I saw no improvement from it. Not even for that ""healthy glow"".",3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Normally I have pretty good skin, no acne issues or flair-ups, not too oily, maybe a bit dry. But a friend had this and I used this on a whim along with cleanser and toner and just overnight it made a difference in my skin. It felt more moisturized and soft! I was really impressed.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I love this product. A little goes a long way. I use this as the last step of my skincare routine before bed on my face and neck and it hydrated my skin (which is on the dry side) very well overnight.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Use this first thing after washing my face and it is amazing. Holds the moisture in and my dry flaky patches are gone! It's my new favorite skin care product‚ù§Ô∏è,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I was using this for 4 months (on my second jar) and saw good results until recently it started burning my face. Not to the point that I couldn't tolerate it but it does cause slight redness now when I use it. I know it's the hylauronic acid. My skin is too dry and sensitive to tolerate it. After a few minutes the burn stops and it absorbs really well, leaving my skin soft and plump but I can feel the dryness aka TEWL. So I'll be returning this tomorrow :/ a little disappointed",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"As soon as I put on this cream my skin instantly turns red... the redness does only last for a couple of seconds but I will still avoid using this cream because it happens after every use. I am not going to lie, after the cream is fully absorbed my skin does feel soft and nice but I will still avoid it. P.S- The weird texture is easy to get used too.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"LOVE! after using a snail serum i wanted to try another snail product and came across this cosrx cream! cosrx products are known for being very good quality so i wanted to try it out! i love the tackiness of the cream because of the snail slime and it really feels moisturizing and thick, great for winter weather! the jar also holds a fairly large amount of product and for the price, it's actually pretty affordable!!!! totally recommend this cream!",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Super moisturizing and a little goes a long way!,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"So, I read all of these rave reviews about this on Ulta's website, and being the skincare junkie that I am, I had to buy it. Admittedly, I'm used to higher end skincare products, but am always looking for cheaper alternatives. This is weird. It's goopy, and slightly sticky. I was able to put makeup on top of it with few issues, but it added no benefits to my skin. I decided to try it a few ways, while my skin was still damp, and mixed in with my daily serums and oils. I was hoping for a hydrated feeling. I didn't get it, but it did give me a few new friends on my cheek, chin, and close to my eyebrow.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Yes this is gooey. Yes it's kinda slimy. Yes it can feel tacky while drying BUT this is the holy grail of face creams. You will glow. Your face will be youthful, dewy and plump!!! Use it as a serum/moisturizer under your makeup (but let dry while you brush your choppers) and then as a serum underneath your main moisturizer/sunscreen when going to bed or going nude. I suggest using generously on your chest, breasts and neck, too, ladies since it is so affordable. No need for age defying products that will cost you 3 times as much as!

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I love this cream. I use it in the mornings on a slightly damp face and it absorbs so nicely, I love how it makes my skin feel! Super soft and glowy :) the container will last you a long time as well, a little goes a long way!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I love this product! Used it for the first time a few years ago and decided to keep trying different brands. After lots of wasted money, I am SO glad I found my way back to this. With just one use, you can feel and see a difference. Skin is smoother, more clear, and has a healthy bounce to it. Instantly saved my dull, dry, winter skin.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I stumbled across this as I was looking at international skin care. I thought it was intriguing. My friends thought I was crazy. I proved them wrong! My 65 year-old skin has never looked better and I've used a lot of very expensive products over the years. I HAD sun damage and scarring. I've used this as my day/night moisturizer for a few months now and my skin looks much, much better and is very soft with no greasiness or oiliness in the afternoon. It goes on very smoothly with no scent at all and sinks into the skin very quickly. I will never be without it. My friends are shocked and I think CosRx might have some new customers.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Dip you finger in the pot, get a little of the goo, avoid getting the strings on your countertops, and apply to skin. Once you get past thinking that it is actually snail goo and avoid getting it everywhere (just pull your finger straight up and wait a second for the trail to detach), the rest is great.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I bought this to try as a night time moisturizer, but it wasn't moisturizing at all (even as a daytime one). I have normal combo skin, and I get some acne. I usually use acne cleanser day and night, and I use retinol at night for acne, so my skin will get quite dry. I tried this before and after putting on retinol (and just putting it on by itself after showering and cleansing). It was not moisturizing at all. My skin felt pretty tight and just didn't feel moisturized, so I waited a bit and even put on more. I woke up the next day to my skin being visibly dry with some flakes. This did nothing for me. I was really excited to try snail mucin, but this just didn't do anything for my skin. It didn't make it look brighter or really anything. While I liked the texture of the product, it just didn't work.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This is a total miss for me! It's Slimy, messy and just felt gross. I also woke up with a bunch of little breakouts after one use which is very rare for me.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Disclaimer - I am not knowledgable about many of the latest skincare and beauty trends. I'm simply a woman in her 30s trying to do right by my skin. I was very skeptical about snail cream but the reviews convinced me to give it a try. This is the mozzarella of face creams - it's thick and stringy. The smell leaves something to be desired. However, I was surprised by how well it absorbs and how bright and moisturized it left my skin. You don't need to slather it on either, just a dab did the trick for me. I've only been using it a few days but I'm encouraged by the results.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This product is so great for the winter especially if you're experiencing drier skin! I love how it feels on the skin you would think that you would feel sticky when you look at the consistency of the product but it feels so light on the skin. It's a wonderful product. A little goes a long way with this product too! I've been using it everyday so far for the past 3 months and I've hardly made a dent in the jar! Very moisturizing and comparable to bigger brand name products I've used!,2,,

I was trying cosrx bha and aha treatments previously which were just making my face worse... The hylauronic acid in this product, I realized is just what I needed for moisture and that soothed my acne as opposed to exfoliation. my skin drinks this stuff right up and has cleared up so much in the last several weeks. I dont have acne as a common problem, just with environmental stressors my skins been impacted a lot and physically from the mask. Anyways I give this product a 10/10, it's more like a gel cream than a typical cream moisturizer hence why everyone says it's sticky.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"In love with this product. At first I wasn't too sure but after a week of use I'm hooked. I use it as my morning cream, it's moisturizing without being greasy or heavy. Getting the right amount is trial and error but overall great product!",5,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Got this during the 21 days of beauty sale for 50% off. Was a great purchase for the sales price. Has a nice amount of product inside unlike many skincare products which are 90% packaging. Loved using this before moisturizer since it's humectant and not a moisturizer. Would recommend using with a product spatula since it's slimey in consistency which i actually quite enjoy. Works great with all the different moisturizers I tried it with. My dryness/scaliness I get from using acne medicine and retinoid was gone with just a week's use of this. One less star because of the original price.,2,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I bought this based off all the good reviews and had very high hopes but was totally let down. First of all I don't even have dry skin, if anything it can be slightly on the oily side, but this product is so not moisturising that I started getting small dry patches in my t-zone where my makeup would stick and look flakey. So I started putting on a thicker layer of the product thinking maybe I wasn't using enough but that didn't help either because then the layer of the product starts to flake too and I have little white flakes coming off of my face all day even without makeup. The only good thing about this product is that it didn't make me breakout at all.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I put this cream on in the morning and at night. I typically have oily skin and this product does not leave your face oily nor dry! It helps with my hormonal acne too.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I was surprised by how much I liked it. I have drier skin and I typically only like rich, dense creams. And this product is very slimy, a little runny, almost gel-like. But it spreads easily and moisturized my skin really well! Works just fine under makeup. I haven't had any groundbreaking results or changes to my skin after using it for several months, but my skin feels smooth and hasn't broken out with this, which is all I'm asking for. I'll probably switch to something heavier for the winter but it's a good choice and you get a ton of product in the jar.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I never write reviews, but I love this product! As someone who's tried a lot of moisturizers, this one is by far the best for morning application. It doesn't disturb my sunscreen or makeup whatsoever and leaves my face feeling plump. I lovveeee the texture and experience this moisturizer offers, it's so cool! I have dry, acne prone skin, but I think this would be great for oily skin too. If you're someone who's looking for a great moisturizer and fun product, I totally recommend this.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Incredible for acne prone skin. I truly believe this has helped with the inflammation of my hormonal acne. If you're super dry like myself in the colder months, I would recommend looking into a thicker cream than this. It is lightweight yet very hydrating especially for oily/combo skin types. i top this off with vaseline at night.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This is a little hidden treasure. The texture is a bit slimey and hard to just get enough for your face but once you apply it to your face, you realize that a little does go a very long way. After application, I noticed during the day that my skin looked dewy, and my skin felt hydrated (not oily) I have oily/combo skin and it is light weight, does not feel heavy on the skin nor does it make my skin oily.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I've never tried snail byproducts but I am a huge fan after testing this out!!! I have sensitive skin and this didn't make my skin react at all. Will continue buying this! Definitely keeps my combo skin hydrated...will have to discontinue using my other hydrators as this beats them for sure!,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I am 31, with oily, textured skin. Bought this because of the hype. First, the jar is huge, bigger than what i was expecting! Have used it over a week, just at night and have not seen any changes. It does dry into my oily skin very well. Will continue to use and see. Have not had any breakouts. The texture of this is slimy and thin and stringy, but like i said, dries nicely once i rub it in.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I like the feel of this on my face. I use it every morning before applying my foundation. I also have been using it on the bumps on the back of my upper arms and have noticed smoother skin there as well.,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Sadly, I won't repurchase this product because of the jar packaging. It is a very good moisturizer but because of the fluidity it is very messy to use. Change the packaging to a pump or tube and I'll repurchae.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've been curious about this for a while so Ulta ran a sale on it, I jumped at the chance. I love this stuff! These snails are humanely treated which is important to me. The texture is gooey but not sticky. It's how do you think snail mucin would feel but definitely not sticky, slimy, or gross. It sinks in pretty quickly. I use it after my night serum but before my night moisturizer. I don't know the difference it would make if I used it in place of a night moisturizer. However, this definitely seems to boost the effects of my current products. My face is clear, hydrated, and looks so healthy. I have gotten several comments lately about how great my skin looks. My skin can be temperamental and break out with new products but it did not do that at all with this. I highly recommend giving it a try. Stick with it for two weeks and see if you notice a difference as well. At the very least, what a great conversation starter!",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Love this product!,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I got this product because I like other cosrx products, and am trying to revamp my skincare routine. I have combo skin with acne scars, congested pores around the nose and chin, and some rough texture. I'm not 30 yet and want to heal my teen errors. This product, combined with my ole henriksen pha cleanser and ordinary niacinamide and zinc have worked together well to help decongest my pores and smooth out some texture on my cheeks and forehead, all after about 3 weeks. That said, with the season changing and the Midwest winds drying things out this moisturizer isn't enough to stop flaking on my skin. I have to add more through the day to soothe my face. I will likely keep using, because once I got used to the slick texture I really like this product, but just layer a thicker cream at night during the winter.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Had the product about a week. The texture is better than I was expecting because it looks more slimy than it feels. I like a lightweight, gel consistency, but some days this feels a little too light for even my oily skin.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This thing is amazing. I never thought I'd love anything to do with snails but I'm sold. It helped my sensitized skin when I was dealing with over exfoliation.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"So I bought this during the 21 days of beauty to see what it was all about. Snails..... this is the lightest, most hydrating moisturiser I've ever used. The consistency is a bit odd and might take some getting used too, but I'm sold.",5,,

I have been using it for a few days, and I'm so happy with the results. I can't speak to fine lines or sun-spots -- yet!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"its slimy but very nice haha! i have dry to combination skin. extremely moisturizing, amazing for price and I was pleasantly surprised by the large size of the jar. I've used just a couple times and can see immediate results. my skin is so smooth and soft, fine lines diminished. doesn't look greasy just melts into the skin.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I use it in the morning and the evening. I think so far it's working quite nicely.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I literally never experienced such hydration. After 3 nightly uses my super dry and itchy patches are gone and my skin is softer than a baby skin. I only think if the package was a pump it would be better than a jar cause the product is too slimy,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have very oily, acne prone and mildly dehydrated skin. I use a very light water based moisturizer first and then this on top. I take it up under the eyes too. this changed my skin. Acne marks heal so much faster, my milla are gone, my skin is so smooth and radiant. Like my skin actually has a sheen but is dry to the touch. My skin hates basically everything but not this! I will not be without it now.",4.6,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have dry skin but frequently moisturizer makes me look greasy. This stuff sinks in beautifully and gives my skin a non-greasy glow. You just have to let it sink in for like 10 minutes. Apply it immediately after getting out of shower.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This moisturizer is a staple in my nighttime routine. I have oily combo skin that is extremely sensitive and this is one of those products that I have complete confidence when applying it to my skin. Not only has it aided in repairing my moisture barrier, but it has also helped reduce my hyperpigmentation and overall texture of my skin. Don't let the word ""cream"" mislead you. This is more of a gel texture that absorbs into the skin sooooo nicely. It's just enough moisture without being too occlusive for my oily combo skin. Seriously, give it a try! The snail mucin essence and this combined are a dream team!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I use this on myself and by boyfriend. Even he's noticed the difference in his skin - best bang for your buck in my opinion!,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Apply a generous amount on my face twice a day and within a week my dry stops were gone. If I could change one thing it would be the packaging.... Why not place inside a pump like device instead of dipping your fingers inside the container. I use a little spatula but still it could be a little more user friendly.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Don't let uneducated people discourage you from trying this product. One reviewer claimed cruelty. Snails secrete toxins when irritated or on the defense so treating them badly would be counterproductive, the product would be unsellable. And salt? Do you know what happens to a snail or slug when salt is put on them? I don't know about other brands, but I've researched this one and the other reviewer needs to educate herself before spreading lies. I've really enjoyed this product so far. Sorry for ranting, but I can't stand it when people ignorantly spread misinformation. don't believe her, don't believe me, do your own research",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I love this! I highly recommend it to everyone. My skin soaks this up. It helped with my dark spots and acne. I saw changes within two weeks of using this product. I even used it to treat some sunburns and by the next day I was healed up. However it does make my skin a little dry but one can easily treat that with a good moisturizer.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have dehydrated, dry skin and I felt like this moisturizer did nothing for me. When I first applied it, it felt super hydrating. But once it fully absorbed, my skin felt dry again. I would say if you have oily skin or combination skin, this would probably be hydrating enough, but in my experience, it's too light for dry skin. I'm bummed it didn't work because besides it not being super hydrating, it was a good quality moisturizer.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I use this morning and/or night after cleansing, and under spf during the day. Makes my dry, blackhead prone adult acne skin feel baby's-butt smooth and soft. No heavy fragrance and this seems strong but gentle enough to even pat right under my eyes without irritation.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I'm back to order another jar! I've been using this as a moisturizer a couple times a week for about a year now. I LOVE IT. It's fun and slimy to apply and absorbs beautifully. It leaves my skin glowing and usually my face is super super oily and I can visibly tell the difference on my forehead at the end of the day when I use this in the morning. I've recommended this every time the topic of moisturizers gets brought up and will be purchasing more as gifts.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Light but thick texture. Smooths, moisturizes and plumps skin. Great product for a great price!",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This is by far the strangest moisturizer I've used. It genuinely has the texture of what I would imagine snail slime to be like; slimy, but it doesn't slide off of your skin, it becomes quite tacky once it's absorbed into the skin. At first I didn't know if I liked it, but my skin has become beautiful and even since I started using this, and my makeup glides right over it. I have combo skin, but I feel like this has really balanced out my complexion, so I don't get as oily during the day. I also have sensitive skin, and have zero irritation with this. I'm a forever customer.",3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I use this product as a morning moisturizer. It absorbs quickly without being too heavy. I have had no issues with it causing any breakouts or other issues.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have been using this for maybe a month now and I love it! My skin has been very oily recently and this has helped so much to control that. It is not very moisturizing though so I need to figure out another product to use with it. But I do love how my skin looks when I use this!,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I use this product about 3-4 times a week as my night time moisturizer. My face looks plump and glowing in the morning.

I really notice a difference in the morning when i wake after using this product, my face actually looks plump and as a healthy glow to it. I am only going to recommend this product on the basis of oily skin, since that is my skin type and I have seen the results of using this product.",5,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have mixed feelings about this product. I love that it clears up the skin and controls the oil really well. I can't put my finger on it, but it does make my skin look better after extended use. However, I do not find it moisturizing at all, it's sticky, and does not play well with makeup. I use it mostly at night. I am on the fence about repurchasing.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This is such a help with healing skin issues. I use a K beauty layering approach. I use this as a treatment and it is light enough to use all year. Thicker than an essence yet plumps my skin nicely. Dry, sensitive and/or acne prone friends should give it a try imo.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Love this cream. Makes my skin so soft and moisturized. I have combo skin and this product is just right. Not too moisturizing but perfect! Gives you a beautiful natural glow. I use this with the essence as well.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I love these snail mucin products! I didn't realize just how beneficial to the skin it could be. I use the essence and the moisturizer and I am obsessed. i am never switching around again! holy grail!,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"looking for something hydrating for my acne prone skin has been a challenge. i came across this product and it's like heaven. it really works well in my inflamed skin. my favorite part is that it doesn't feel heavy and it absorbs it very well leaving the face hydrated and moisturized. it's good for skin with compromised barriers. plus, it's fragrance free! i would buy it again",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Restored my skins moisture barrier! So I messed up my moisture barrier by using CeraVe SA body wash on my face, once after working out and once before bed, + sun exposure + AHA's at night; it felt and looked like chicken skin...all over my face. Itched like crazy, started peeling. Nothing felt right on my face, not even coconut oil, except for this moisturizer. This is strong enough to restore a damaged moisture barrier, I'm now hesitant to be without it and will be repurchasing!",1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I decided to try this product after hearing the great pros about snail mucins and COSrx being a very liked brand due to the high % of mucin. I'd do not expect much results after the first use but when I tell you my skin the next morning was FIRM and had a healthy glow, it really did! The acne marks on my face are slowly fading, small cystic like acne that was coming into my face ended up disappearing within the first week. After continued use, I have had no new acne and my face is finally getting a chance to heal. My mom (50+) noticed many fine lines within her forehead were tightened. I did some research and learned cosrx snail Mucin also has anti-aging ingredient that may have been the reason for my moms results. Overall, for such a good priced worth the product! Will purchase more as soon as the product is in stock again.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,i was using the cosrx snail mucin essence which i LOVED. i wanted to try this too. but i keep waking up with acne in places i never get it. no other new products besides this one. it's soooo moisturizing and i love the texture. a little goes a LONG WAY. i'm gonna keep trying it to see if it's just a purging period?,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've never really experimented with K-Beauty. Recently, I kind of fell into a rabbit hole of Korean skincare videos and decided to give this a try. My skin is still recovering from a not so great experience with retinol. I find that after applying this it feels...sticky. I was afraid I would hate it! But after giving the product a little time to breathe and a chance for my skin to fully absorb it.. I love it. My skin feels soooo smooth and soft, and there's an immediate glow. I wake up and my skin looks bright and smooth, ready to combat the day :) DEFINITELY excited to try more from other brands!!",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have dehydrated oily/acne prone skin. I absolutely love this product and have repurchased several times. It's not moisturizing enough for me to wear alone so I layer my Cerave moisturizing cream on top. It works great as an under-eye moisturizer as well! It does have a slimey texture right out of the jar but once you put it on it feels fantastic!!! I can't put into words what this actually does for my skin but I do see a difference.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Of course the texture is bizarre, this product is full of snail secretions! It is a wonderful product to use after taking makeup off or during the day when my face is severely irritated.",1,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"So I was skeptical on using snail products but once I tried cosrxs essence I knew I had to try this. The texture? Disgusting. Literally. How it makes your skin look and feel? Totally worth it. My skin is so PLUMP and hydrated and I owe it all to both of those products. üòç if you're questioning getting it, do it. You'll get over the texture.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have been putting this on nightly as my last step in my skin care routine since I purchased the jar about four months ago. The texture took me a bit to get used to but it wasn't a big deal. A very small amount of this product gets the job done. I am impressed with the results! My skin is soft and hydrated. I've also noticed an improvement in appearance. My skin has a tendency to look oily and I sometimes get red, blotchy patches but that hasn't been a problem lately. Despite daily use, I still have about half a jar left- a little bit goes a long ways! I will definitely our purchase another jar when I get low on this one!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I love this product so much. I'm on my third jar. I didn't know much about this product but just bought it because of the snail properties.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"The youth serum of nature, and found in high end expensive makeup products, this CosRX snail 92 is incredibly affordable and lasts a long time.

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Let me start off by saying I have combination skin. It's overall very oily but I can get dehydrated flakey areas on TOP of the oil. It's a mess lol. Most moisturizers for oily/combo skin are gel and I haven't had much luck finding one I like. Most of the time they aren't hydrating enough. Other moisturizers leave my face an oil slick. I was in the market for a new one and stumbled upon this. I've heard great things about the 96 Snail Mucin Essence and was excited to see it in a moisturizer form. It's got a very slimy consistency, but I expected that and it doesn't bother me. It's unscented as well. After you first apply it, it's a little tacky. But give it 2-3 minutes and it absorbs right into your skin. You can't even feel it on the skin and I've had no issues wearing makeup over it. I pair it with The Ordinary hyaluronic serum and I'm baby soft all day. It keeps dry patches at bay while never leaving me greasy and shinier than usual. A little goes a long way too, so I feel like the product will last a long time! 10/10 would recommend if you're looking for something light but also worry about dryness!",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I bought both the essence and the cream because I wanted to see which one worked better. Long story short, I liked the cream better than the essence because it was more hydrating. What drew me to this product was its claims of hydration (harsh WI winters) and abilities to improve texture and hyperpigmentation. I have sensitive acne prone skin and this did not break me out. I noticed that as soon as I put it on after washing my face (while skin is still damp), my red face would almost immediately fade. This cream is definitely anti-inflammatory! It's only one week in, and I'm not sure I see an improvement in my pigmentation but it definitely doesn't look worse. In regards to improving my skin texture... my skin is the softest it has ever been! Granted that I use rx retinoid at night so I know I am getting some exfoliation there but this cream pairs very well in helping to renew my skin during the day. My skin definitely has that ""glass"" luminosity during the day. I will continue to purchase this product.",5,,

Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Hi I used this mostly at night after other serums or sometimes in the morning before my sunscreen moisturizer. I can't believe how hydrating this - my undereye lines are seriously plumped up.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I love this moisturizer because it leaves my skin very supple all day, and because it is not heavy nor does it have a heavy fragrance.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have dry, ruddy skin. this (used with the essence) adds so much moisture, has reduced my redness noticeably, and has helped fade my acne scars. it soaks in, and leaves me feeling soft but not greasy. price per oz is great too, if you can afford the upfront cost.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,not for nothing this really did it for me...while the name May gross u out the feeling is amazing!!!,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"So i would start this out with saying WOW... this stuff is amazing!!! this is my first time using this name brand along with snail mucin but it won't be my last!!! so at 1st i thought I'd be grossed out about it but its actually the complete opposite...I'm drawn to this stuff..its so great on ur skin yes its a lil sticky but once u get passed that and realize ur using snail ""tracks"" lol then u get passed it and soak up alll the healthy things this stuff does for skin and wrinkles... i will def be continuing this all in one but it wont be all by itself as an all in 1... vent wait till tonight to use this again!!!!! -nat",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have ridiculous combination skin and was breaking out in dry patches from blowing my nose and nothing worked - this is amazinggg! My skin is mouth and the patches are gone!,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I love how the product plumps your skin while moisturizing.,3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I absolutely adore this moisturizer I have very dry skin and this is just the perfect amount of moisture. However, I do not recommend using this product then applying makeup over it. I've been testing it out with different products as well as my typical routine and every single time when I put this moisturizer on over my primer/foundation my foundation starts to bead up. Other than that one problem I highly recommend this product!",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This is a very interesting moisturizer. It is very soothing. Yes, the texture is slimy but, I think it feels really nice on the skin. It is not enough for my dry winter skin. I use it during the day in combination with serums and my spf. I do recommend it if, your skin needs some healing.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This completely changed my skin. I have combo skin with horrible hormonal, ingrown hairs and acne along my chin and this cleared that up! I use this daily and it does help curb the hormonal issue, but its a monthly thing that no product will ever be able to fully tame. I already have a back up and i'm only half way through my open one.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,This is a great moisturizer. I recently started using dermaharmony sulfur 10% and salicylic acid 3% soap so I wanted a gentle moisturizer that was hydrating but not too heavy. This is perfect! My skin had never felt so soft. I use a generous amount just because my skin absorbs the product so well and I don't have to worry about looking like an oil slick if I apply too much. It also gives that glass skin finish once it dries.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"my skin has been drying out thanks to changing weather with horribly low humidity and a change in birth control. i normally get hormonal acne once a month or with stress, we will see how that goes. but i literally bought this 4 days ago with the cosrx oil free lotion, and i can already see a massive difference in texture, tone, and hydration. i am a devout 10-step method follower, but i was still suffering dry patches and even some flaking! in 3 full days of adding both this cream and the oil free lotion though, i have no dry patches, no flaking, my red spots are reduced, and my skin doesn't feel tight anymore- that has been my constant complaint for years. im not getting super oily at the end of the day either- i could just mitigate it with a blotting paper. i have to use an extra high spf (currently 85, up to 100 in summer and never below 60 because i will burn) due to my job- im exposed to the sun coming thru the windows for hours, plus the aircon does not help with dryness- it actually spurs my skin to produce more oil to protect from the dry air. but these last 3 days ive not been itchy. or tight and dry. the oiliness from my sunscreen is diminished. this ish is just miraculous, is what im saying.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"It's nice and hydrating but acts more as a ""serum"" than a moisturizer. It can replace as a serum and would be considered a good price because of the amount but I don't recommend it as a last step moisturizer in skin care. It should preferably have an occlusive moisturizer, like the CeraVe face and body lotion, layered on top since the snail mucin is more of a humectant than a true moisturizer.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I absolutely adore CosRx, and I'm stoked that Ulta carries a wide variety of their line so I can try more of their products. Unfortunately, even with really strong, great brands, not everything works for every skin type. I'd wanted to try this as a new moisturizer, as what I'd been using made my skin a bit too oily, and I'd tried a snail based face mask a while back that made my skin super soft. I'd assumed that this cream would do the same. For starters, it seems REALLY goopy right out of the jar - but it's not sticky, and it felt like even if I put on too much, it quickly absorbed into my skin without leaving a film or a cast behind. Great, right? Except I noticed that during the day...my nose, my cheeks - they felt SUPER dry. Like I'd washed my face with steaming hot water dry. And whenever I put my sunscreen over it, it felt like it made the dryness worse. Over a few days of using this product, I noticed that I was breaking out in the same areas where I was feeling that excessive dryness - cheeks, chin, nose. So it looks like I'm going to be returning this!",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I use it as my night time moisturizer. My skin feels more firm and smooth. I like that it has virtually no scent. I get eczema on my face and it has cleared up in just 3 uses. Love this product!,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I purchased the product because I have very dry skin. I wanted a moisturizer and something healthy for my skin. This product does give you a glow, but its temporary, well at least for me. I used the product twice a day, in the morning and before bed. Its not a bad product but it leaves my skin feeling sticky,don't get me wrong I know its made of snail secretions,but I was hoping the sticky feeling would fade. I know after a week it wouldnt cure my dry skin but hoping some sort of progress.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I pair this with a heavy moisturizer when I need extra hydration, but I love how smooth it makes my skin. I know some people complain it's not hydrating enough, but again, that's why I don't use it alone. The main reason I love this though is because it's got a perfect pH between 5~6, which is the best for skin. Even the Snail Mucin Essence, as great as it is, has a pH closer to 6~7, but this cream keeps me balanced and clear.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This hydrates your skin like none other. I use it as the next step after my serums which I then follow up with moisturizer. It has a slimy texture but that doesn't bother me at all, it's snail secretion after all! I have dry skin and this somehow acts as almost a layer of water underneath my moisturizers making my skin glowy, supple and hydrated. I use mostly Exuviance for my skincare but this has been a great daily/nightly addition to boost my hydration levels and quench my skin.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I would swear that this gel is plumping my skin and my wrinkles look less pronounced. I have used it both morning and night as a moisturizer after cleansing. It absorbs really well into the skin and has zero irritation. A little goes a long way so this may last me a whole year!! I love it! May try other things from this brand next.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I LOVE this whole line. I first bought the Oil Free Moisturizer to try and it worked so well under my makeup! I have combination Acne Prone skin. It didn't leave a film or residue, and I have had less breakouts since using it.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I was so excited to try this face lotion since it has so many great reviews and was decently priced and was so, so disappointed when I used it for the first time! It is not nearly hydrating enough, not even as a daytime lotion, and it left my skin feeling dry and tight. Maybe if the serum is used with it, it would add more hydration, but alone didn't do the trick.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have enjoyed other snail products in the past so when my old moisturizer ran out I thought I would try this. Only problem is after several days of use I can tell, this is not really a moisturizer. By itself it just isn't enough to hydrate my dry skin. It leaves me with dry patches. No good. It's more like a serum or something in my opinion. To be fair the how to use part of the description does hint that this needs to be layered but I didn't know that when I was shopping in store. More information- product doesn't really have a scent. Texture is very sticky, which I do not like. Dries to a matte finish after application. I will not be repurchasing, there are better snail creams out there, and they cost less, too.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Love this!! I stack my moisturizers since I need all rhe moisture I can get and this just gives a boost when im about to sleep or start my day. It doesnt leave any residue it absorbs quickly and its a light weight formula. I put this in the fridge too for a very refreshing moisturizer.,4.6,,

I was super hesitant at first and it was somewhat of an impulse buy because I had never heard of it and I don't usually buy products without reading tons of reviews first. But something told me to give this one a shot and I am SO glad that I did. My skin has never been clearer, softer, or more even. I have combination skin and this keeps my dry areas moisturized and my oily areas matte. I have a feeling the jar will last a long time, because it only takes a tiny amount to cover my whole face and neck. The one downfall I would say is the container it comes in. I typically prefer a pump or a squeeze bottle because it minimizes contamination, but I just make sure I wash my hands well before dipping in to the product to make sure it stays clean. If you're on the fence about this product, give it a chance. You won't regret it.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Let me start by saying that I have a massive dimethicone allergy as well as the most dehydrated and easily clogged skin in the world. My acne is mostly hormonal that ranges from cystic to small bumps all over the surface of my skin. Within three days of using this product I have already given up on every other moisturizer I have ever used. This has brightened my skin, truly hydrated it without causing any greasiness, and kept my acne soothed and at bay. I have tried probably hundreds of moisturizers geared towards every skin type and they have all caused an issue along the line but this product is the perfect texture and balance. You get an amazing amount of product and I will recommend this to everyone that I know.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I wanted to love this product but after about 4 days my skin broke out terribly. I had small bumps everywhere and cystic acne. Had such high hopes. Bummer.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"This stuff is freaky, but so amazing. I loved the essence they sell so I got this as a daily moisturizer. First of all, most moisturizers in gel form kinda dissolve as you stick your fingers in the jar, leaving you with less product every time (ie. Garnier) but this slimy stuff goes a long way. Takes about a week just to use up the stuff on the lid. Heals acne scars, smooths skin, and reduces acne. Snails are cool.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I was so excited when I found out that Ulta carries this brand and immediately bought this product. It feels nice when applied at first but it doesn't hydrate well and doesn't last all day.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I got this product feeling unsure...I haven't tried a lot of K-Beauty products, and I have pretty extreme combination skin. I break out all around my chin, but then my cheeks will be super dry and peeling. Also, my skin can be very sensitive to a lot of products. I usually rotate between a couple of Origins moisturizers, and sometimes Hope in a Jar by Philosophy- those are the only ones that have helped my dry spots and added a nice lively glow without breaking me out. This, however, is a game changer. It feels like a hybrid between a serum and a gel moisturizer. Give it a few minutes to dry, and it sinks right into my skin, leaving me glowy but nothing greasy or oily. I literally noticed a difference after one day of using it! Not only that, but it keeps my skin hydrated all day or night long! I've worn this under light makeup (when I'm not using a primer) and it works wonderfully. No separation or anything, although I do think it may cause foundation to apply a little less evenly if you're using something heavy. Regardless, great product for daytime or for nighttime. It also gives me a bit of a smoothing pore minimizing effect. Also, it's a great value compared to other products at the price point! The jar is huge!",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Saw this at my local Ulta and became really interested, because well it's snail goop. My boyfriend and I tried it in the store and really loved it! I've been using it ever since and it feels amazing, it really helps tone down my eczema flare ups. My boyfriend has dry skin and it helped a TON he hasn't had any dry patches ever since!!",3,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I usually don't write reviews but lord, this is something that changes my face within days of use. My skin feels so smooth and my pores have shrunk and my skins texture is just so much better. Helps with pores, acne, dark spots, and doesn't make your face oily. It does feel weird getting it on. Feels a little slimy or so but it doesn't smell not feel sticky and it doesn't feel thick on your face where it feels like you got it caked on. It's an amazing product. I will be buying over again. I've pretty much use this and one of the toner at night and Mario badesco buffer. Lotion for cystic acne and my face has looked so good within days.",4,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I was super excited to buy this so I didn't have to wait a week to get a Korean moisturizer online. It felt really nice on my skin when I first put it on... days later I realized I got dry around my Tzone. I thought I just needed to get used to the product. But it has been two weeks since I have been using it everyday, and my skin got progressively dryer. And I have oily skin. So it's oil over dry patches. Doesn't feel the greatest nor make your makeup look good.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"typically I have very acne prone dry angry skin. I wash makeup off and my center of my face (nose and surrounding area) is bright red all the time. I've been using this stuff about 3 -4 weeks and feel I can give an honest and thorough review. I was on the hunt for a silicone free moisturizer. I also want a moisturizer that actually delivers results beyond hydration. I stumbled on this stuff and was not let down. as far as moisture goes, I wear this under a heavy moisturizer. it has eliminated all the redness and drastically improved my skins texture. I do recommend.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"Good moisturer. I'm using it everyday underneath make up & at night before going to bed. It's good for the money, too.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I bought this because Fiddy Snails said she uses it under her eyes and my eye area was flaking bad from a retinoid and I apply it all over my face too. I bought an airless pump jar to make it so I don't have to keep unscrewing the jar and dipping my fingers in. The texture is a little sticky at first but it absorbs quickly and has helped my dry skin immensely in a matter of days.,4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I have very dry sensitive skin.... I have eczema & rosacea.. use it once and the next day no redness, dryness.. it was a miracle worker",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I heard that snail goop was good for your skin so bought this. The cream is the exact same texture as snail slime would be so it's kind of weird. It gets every where when you put it on, and a little goes a very long way. I've been using it for a few months, and don't notice a difference in how hydrated my skin is, or my skin's appearance.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I love this stuff so much. It completely retexturized my skin and gives it a nice healthy glow. I've tried other snail creams but come back to this one. It has a stringy almost sticky like consistency but I feel like that texture really helps with the glow. Lasts a long time too. If you're dry skinned you'll need another moisturizer and I usually put a little bit of on top of it especially at night. Im a little on the oily side so I use a Murad moisturizer that controls that during the day and a thicker one at night.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I absolutely love the COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence. So, I was pretty excited about trying out the COSRX Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream. The cream does not break me out. That is a plus point. However, it does nothing to moisturize my face. I have to put on another cream on top of it so that I can make it through the winter. Disappointed.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I use this after cleansing and toning, has given my skin a healthy glow without lightening or dyring it out.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I'm a die hard Cosrx cult follower! I've never had good skin until I started using their products. However with this product I didn't know until about a week into using it that I started breaking out, and turns out some people have been having reaction with the snail mucin if they have dust mite/seasonal allergies. So just be cautious! I don't have a reaction to any of their other products though.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"It feels similar to hair putty & is tacky at first, but once applied, smooths out like a serum. I cleanse with Trader Joe's spa face wash, Clinique #2 lotion, apply the snail essence, at night apply the truffle oil serum (can't think of the name) & then use this moisturizer. My skin feels super soft already.",2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I had months with very dry skin during the summer which is unusual for me, I Love Korean products and was surprised to find Corxs at Ulta, this cream is amazing I saw changes in a matter of days. I even use it on some dry patches around my elbows.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"love this product and I'm so glad I found it! I have sensitive, acne prone, and combination oily skin. I have been using this plus the COSRX advanced snail 96 power for about 2weeks and I have already seen improvements. It does great for: wound healing, spot reducing, hydration, redness, fine lines and reducing my puffy eyes. All with NO irritation!!! Which for me is huge. I recommend this whole line to everyone seriously.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Loved it until it broke me out :/,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I've already tried the Mizon snail cream and my skin really enjoyed that product so I figured why not try something with more snail? This is a very nice product if you have oily acne prone skin because it is lighter than most moisturizers. Also snail is amazing because it will hydrate and help skin heal very well. I'm going to try the snail Essence next because that has an even higher concentration of snail.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Love this cream. I have acne prone skin and some scarring from past acne and this doesn't break me out or cause irritation. I've only been using it for a week but I do feel that it gives my skin a glow and wears great under makeup. I put it on after washing my face in the morning and night.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,I have been using this for almost two months and I love it! It's a lightweight moisturizer for my am routine.,5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"i have acne prone and sensitive skin with lots of hyperpigmentation. after using this product for months i instantly noticed how bright and moisturized my skin became! it's definitely evened out my skin tone and made it super smooth. i found the product sticky and weird at first, but once i used it every night you'll get used to the texture. once absorbed you won't even feel the stickiness. it does wonders and people have been complimenting me on how much my skin has improved.",4.6,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"I've been very into skin care lately and Korean skincare in particular. Most of the products from this line are great because they very straight forward with the ingredients and it works. This snail cream makes you feel like you're applying slime to your face but the result is so worth it. You're left with firm, radiance and glowy skin after daily use of this. Perfect for summer season and for people with oily/combo skin.",5,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,Love the texture of this cream. Very light weight and absorbs to the skin quickly. Although this cream claims it's an moisturizer it actually makes my skin feel tight but plump at the same time. I would not be able to wear this alone so I use this in conjunction with more rich moisturizer. As far as the anti wrinkles because it makes my skin plump and tight it does have a temporary anti wrinkle effect.,2,,
Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,"After using this product for about a week, the skin around my mouth and jaw line got really dried out. I noticed it a couple days in but I thought maybe my skin just needed to get use to it but by the end of the week it was worse! I went back to my old cream but am still struggling with the dry patches that this gave me!",5,,

Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,I only bought it because it was in the clearence section but it's not even worth it. Instead of moisturizing it leaves a horrible film on your skin that's a sensory nightmare and doesn't go away until the next day basically. Would not recommend,1.5,,
Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,"Listen to other reviewers amd save your money. Sticky and filmy. Feels sticky hours later. I miss Body Shop's older formulations. Vegan, of course, does not mean natural. This is like using petroleum jelly's crunchy cousin.",5,,
Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,Absolutely love this brand and smell! So moisturizing and absorbs into the skin leaving me so soft and comfortable.,1,,
Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,"So this item has gotten so many bad reviews because its old product. TBS isnt making new product for the US market, so this is likely just old. Their regular scrub doesnt leave a film all over you after using.",1,,
Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,"So this item has gotten so many bad reviews because its old product. TBS isnt making new product for the US market, so this is likely just old. Their regular scrub doesnt leave a film all over you after using.",1,,
Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,"A disgusting greasy mess. It leaves a gross film all over you and it's nearly impossible to get off. I had to wash my entire body three times just to stop feeling sticky. It's also not even a scrub, it's more like a tub of crisco with a pinch of sand thrown in. There's not enough actual scrub in it to do anything. Smells nasty too. I swear I had bought this before and it was completely different so I don't know if they changed it or I'm delusional but it's awful. I would say it's overpriced but really it just shouldn't be sold at all.",1.5,,
Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,"I never leave comments, but this is AWFUL. Everythinv other reviewers said is true.",5,,
Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,"Agree with the other reviews. Texture is thick and like a paste. If the awful texture didn't stop you already, you would have to use 1/2 the tub for one shower because it doesn't thin out. No exfoliating at all. Finally leaves a residue that won't rinse off well. Would give 0 if possible as a rating",1,,
Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,"I am not exagerating this is the worst body scrub I have ever used. The texture of it is incredibly waxy and leaves an very thick film all over the skin, and it will leave a greasy layer all over your shower. It was incredibly hard to apply. Because the texture was so thick and waxy it did not just melt into the skin the way other sugar scrubs do. And finally the scent was FOUL. In the tub it wasn't too offensive but still smelled strongly of wax, almost like a candle or a crayon. Immediately after using it in the shower today with my usual body wash, I noticed that my skin smelled almost like burnt? I really have no other way to describe the smell besides sour burning hair. I have never in my life used a shower product that made me feel dirtier afterwards, but theres a first time for everything!",1,,
Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,Do not purchase. This product does not wash off or absorb. Leaves skin feeling awful.,1,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"you have probably read reviews that say the exact thing. just for warning, this is pretty much all cons. first off; SMELL. something about it just doesn't come appealing. second; heavy. if you put some on, its hard to apply makeup because of weight and thickness. third; doesn't moisturize very well! it may feel great for the first minutes but then you feel like you need more pretty soon. im pretty sure i covered it all for now. as of right now, ive switched to ""bubble"".",4.4,,

If you use any sort of actives on your skin, this moisturizer won't feel good and just caused irritation. Doesn't moisturize at all. Even wearing in the summer when I don't need much, it felt like this was drying me out. Just because skin is oily doesn't mean it shouldn't be moisturized. Don't waste your money.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I used this moisturizer because it was recommended to me by a friend who also has sensitive skin.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This is the best face cream,1,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I got suggested this by a very sweet employee for a hydrating face mask. I live hydrogel masks so i figured id give it a try. Im usually not sensitive to sheer masks but when i opened the package i could smell the strong fragrance immediately. After putting it on my face it felt super cooling and i enjoyed it. Once i looked at the ingredients however i saw the fragrance was super high on the list and i got concerned since my skin can be kinda sensitive to scent especially so high in the list. I left it on for the minimum time to be safe but once removed it and my skin touched the air it STUNG and was very inflamed. I immediately washed my face and moisturized and even the moisturizer tingled which meant my skin barrier was disrupted. Its day three after the mask and my skin is doinf way better but i would NOT recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin or honestly anyone to be honest. The cooling sensation was very nice but ill never understand why companies pack skincare with so much fake fragrance.,1,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Has frgrance which caused a reaction in my sensitive skin. I purchased this as it came recommended from a dermatologist, but unfortunately my sensitive skin was looking for hyaluronic acid and not frgrance so my face had a reddish breakout.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This product is not the same as the old gel cream they used to have. They said that is was just a repackaging but I think they changed the ingredients too. I started to break out and my skin go so dry and itchy after using this product. I do not have sensitive skin either. This product was the only thing that changed in my skin care. I don't like them rebranding and using different ingredients. They took away one of my favorite cleansers in the past too. Don't improve on products that have been doing so well for years!,5,,

I was shocked because it was summer and I sweat alot. I didn't see any real benefits at all from it after using it for three months and all.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I like this product! It certainly did not cause me to break out, which is huge because a lot of moisturizers do. However, it did not moisturize as well as I hoped it would. I have very dry skin, and had been using Kiehls Ultra Facial Cream prior to trying this. I was hoping this would be a less expensive alternative, but after about 6 weeks of using this, I am definitely starting to get a bit dry again. This product also doesn't last nearly as long as Kiehls UFC, so back to Kiehls it is!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Oh how I LOVE these. Great to keep in the fridge. I use them more during winter months.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,honesty i have been looking for something to compare to clinique moisture surge since that has been my go to for sooo long but ts just so expensive so i looked into this brand. when i tell you i honestly may even like this better... it trult leaves my skin feeling super hydrated without a heavy oily feeling. its so lightweight and feels like nothing while making my skin look super glowy and just amazing. highly recommend this.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Over the years I've tried several different hyaluronic acids, some considered more high-end, others more consumer friendly prices. This is the best one I have ever used. It's very lightweight and absorbs in quickly without leaving any kind of residue behind. It really does make the skin look more hydrated and plumped, where others have left my skin looking crepey around my eyes when I would smile, leave a residue, or never really absorbed. There's a reason this brand has such a solid reputation. Other bands rely more on the name, not the quality. This will be my go-to for hyaluronic acid products. I have no reason to look at another brand for a product like this. What's that old saying, ""When you have the best, forget the rest?""",2,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I wanted to try this since I heard it was a ""dupe"" for the clinque moisture surge moisturizer line. It isn't a terrible product, but it's not anywhere close to as moisturizing as the Clinque product is and it has a strong chemical smell.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Literally, hands down, best moisturizer. Just get it and at least try it. I have combination skin, oily tzone and dry everywhere else. It doesnt break out my tzone and keeps me hydrated. I have tried COUNTLESS of moisturizers. I've been using this for a year now, I haven't found anything better than this. I've got my MIL and my mom hooked on this stuff (age 50's). I love it!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Ok so i have combo skin that is oily in my t-zone and dry pretty much everywhere else. I used to have to apply so much powder on my nose to try and hide my oil. BUT since using this it has balanced my skin so well!!!

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"My face felt like it was burning after applying this product. It also caused redness in my neck area.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I hate lotions or anything that feels like its trapping my skin with a layer of oil or leaves it greasy. That obviously applies to my face as well. Most moisturizers are heavy, and while they ate effective, they're just not right for me. Neutrogena's Water Based Gel is incredible though! It is extremely hydratinf and plumps my skin, but is almost completely absorbed within minutes. It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth and not like I have a layer of, well‚Ä¶lotion on it. I use a satin pillowcase, and it is dry enough within just a couple minutes to lay down and not feel like I'm sticking to the pillowcase. If you have any sensory adversities to traditional moisturizers, this is a godsend. So lightweight and absorbent. It has a light smell, but its a fresh smell, almost what you would expect ""water"" to smell like, but nothing floral and no strong perfume smell. I've tried several other water-based and they have not given me the same results or the same lightweight feel and absorbency. This is definitelt my #1.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"You need this! This is the only moisturizer ive found (so far) that actually leaves my skin feeling hydrated, glowing - yet DOESN'T cause excess oil/sebum production. Can be used either time of the day, can be a bit heavy but absorbs very quickly. Price point is not bad at all! Has a clean smell, and a pretty simple yet cute packaging. Its a 10/10 for me. Definitely lives up to the hype.",1,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"The formulation of their gel cream products is phenomenal. However, yesterday I returned the regular Hydro boost because I opened it to be blasted in the face with headache inducing fragrance. I don't even know why you would put fragrence in a face cream. Then today I just used the cream gel for hands, and again with the fragrance. And it is strong. I have no idea why these things have fragrance in them, but I have to return this as well because I have hand eczema. Please, Neutrogena, stop with a fragrance. It is not necessary and it is a major irritant.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"My mom has been using this and really likes it, so when I got a sample of it I was excited to try it. It made my skin tacky and caused my skin to be plagued with black heads. It was the only thing I changed in my routine. I think I'll still to Tula's day and night cream",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Love this mask!!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"For whatever reason when I apply this, it's a little spicy on my skin.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I randomly found this holy grail about 6 years ago and it is my all time favorite. I use it before special events or when I want my skin to look and feel really good. Its so hydrating and it feels so good to have on, does not burn at all. I recommend using it for the full 30 minutes, that way it really absorbs the moisture and you only have to pat in a little excess at the end. 10/10 would recommend",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have been using this for almost 2 years and this stuff gave me the worst cystic acne I have ever had. I didn't realize this was causing it until about a month ago after I tried every medicine and topical from the derm and nothing was working, I decided to try switching my moisturizer and sure enough my skin cleared up almost immediately. I haven't had a single pimple in almost a month and this was the only product I changed from my routine. also if your skin is flaky dry this will do nothing for you.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,It's not a perfect product. The mask could fit my face better. If you're looking for a little dose of hydration in addition to your daily moisturizing routine this is a great option. However when I traveled to a drier climate I used one of these to try and help my skin adjust to the lack of humidity and it didn't do too much to help my overly dry skin. Lathering more of my regular moisturizer on seemed to work better than this in that case.,5,,

I can't even add any cons.",4,,

I couldn't even put on makeup because my face was so dry, to the point of sloughing off, like a bad sunburn... I googled the best options for very dry skin and this came up. I started using the Hydroboost wipes and this gel once at night... Four days of using the product and my dry skin has almost completely cleared up! I highly recommend it. The scent is light. It feels good on your skin. The wipes are very convenient.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I wanted to love this product so bad, but it just didn't work out for me personally.

I bought this because the Clean & Clear gel moisturizer I loved was no longer available in stores, and this is another highly rated gel moisturizer. I have now broken out on my cheeks (a place I have never had issues with before) and forehead because of this product. I'm not sure what it is that my skin doesn't agree with, but I have NEVER had a reaction like this to any product I've tried, even cheaper ones.",5,,

I tried it over 2 days, morning and night and Overall it didn't turn my face red which was great, and it really made my face feel great but I couldn't use it every day due to the unfortunate scent. As soon as I put it on it was non stop sneezing for about 20-30 minutes. The scent does fade eventually but it is so intense when it first goes on and it was just to much.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have been using this for over a week now and I have been very happy with it. My skin tends to get a little dry in spots, and I wanted to try a moisturizer that wasn't thick. This is the perfect mix of lightweight and hydration!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I love this moisturizer!! It works great for my dry skin and it feels very cooling. My only problem is that the prize keeps increasing.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This completely ruined my skin. I'm 17 and before using this my skin was pretty much completely smooth. I'm usually picky with what i use on my face but a family member recommended this to me so i used it without looking at the ingredients (which are awful and filled with silicones by the way) I woke up the morning after using it ONCE and my skin was red, bumpy, and swollen. I haven't broken out like this since i was like 13. I am FUMING. I have no idea how to get my skin back to how it was now, or how long it will take. Like i don't mean to be a Karan but oh my god please don't use this on your face. It would probably be nice as a hand cream or something",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have oily/combo skin so I was concerned at first since it's supposedly catered towards dry skin. I've been having tons of dry patches lately and my skin had been looking extremely cakey with my previous moisturizer. After switching to the water gel, my skin has been so soft and matte throughout the day. My skin feel moisturized but not greasy at all. It's so good!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I hate the greasy feeling it leaves, I hate the way it always has a smell to it, and I hate how expensive they are! BUT, this moisturizer? This is a life saver!!! Oh my goodness, it has no after feeling, so light weight it literally blends into your skin almost like butter but without the thickness! It has no smell, a little how's such a long way and it's actually aided in my chronic dry skin!!! I've only been using this for 3 days but already I see a HUGE difference",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,i really like this moisture and how it applies because my skin is oily and this is heavily recommended by lots of dermatologists and such. but this stuff makes my face BURN when i don't have sensitive skin whatsoever. i think it even made me break out. even my old ponds was better than this. the search for a perfect moisturizer continues...,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I bought this for my daughter. She wont use anything else.,5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Works amazing,4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have dry skin and I got this mask for 'hydrating' my skin. However my skin had never been dried after using a Hydrating mask. It leaves no moisture on face at all. That makes me think if it's only for 'oily' skin,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I liked how hydrating and cooling the mask was. It fits face nicely with it being two pieces. But it was difficult to apply onto face, it came folded and was difficult to unfold and tell which side to apply. Not bad but there's so many other options easier to apply.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"it's a moisturizing mask, but on the heavy side. It comes in 2 pieces: one for the top portion of my face and one for the bottom half. The bottom half kept sliding off.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have only used this for one week and it has already changed my skin dramatically, i suffer from acne and let me tell you my face is so smooth now. Perfect for oily skin, this is a must.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I read a comment on the fragrance being repulsive. Nothing could be further from the truth in my experience. It has a very light, pleasant fragrance, that disappears quickly as it melts into my skin. My skin feels moist without being sticky. What more can you ask of a moisturizer? Will purchase again.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Apply after Aha cleanse, toner in am, & after a midday shower",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I simply love this. It does make my skin smooth for foundation.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"was excited to get this because my friend liked it and it was in many articles about moisturizer for oily skin. The first thing i saw was that it had fragrance and coloring in the ingredients. those aren't necessary and it was a red flag right away. even though i used a good amount it left my forehead looking scaly. it made my nose burn and turn red. after a while it was stinging. i washed it off and put my other moisturizer on and it cleared up immediately. the next day my skin was still irritated and i had hives on my jaw and in my nose (i had put extra around my nose because it gets rly dry), and hives on my chin which were very painful and took the elasticity away for that time. neutrogena has never been my friend. i was hopping this one would be different but i guess not. still terrible and frivolous ingredients.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I use this product after washing my face in the morning or night and it always leaves my face feeling super soft. It's lightweight and dries quickly. The best part is that it's not oily at all and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I bought the travel size first as a trail and loved it so I ended up buying the full size. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lightweight face moisturizer.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Disappointing. Messy to get out of package and put on. Doesn't hydrate. When I take it off my face feels dry. No thank you. Would not buy again or recommend. Price point is good but other then that no thanks,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love this product so much! I'm addicted to serums, but nothing else I've used has produced such instant improvements in the texture of my skin. I feel like I have 'de-aged' many years after using this. My skin looks plumped with hydration and smooth. I use it morning and night (it doesn't take much) along with a few other products that I have been using, like a collagen/peptide serum and vitamin C serum.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"So bad I had to wash it off after 10 mins, I couldn't stand it.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"My skin has been super dry this winter so I was looking for something more hydrating than I normally use. I loved how 'wet' this product felt when I applied it, however, I started forming rashes/chapping easily on my face where I had dry spots. I wasn't sure if it was this product or not so switched off it while my chapping healed, and then gave it another shot. Instantly the chapping came back. Definitely pretty disappointed I couldn't finish the jar. Will have to give it another try in the summer when it's less dry.",3,,

It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated without it feeling greasy or too oily. Love, love, LOVE this product!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This stuff literally makes my face feel like a baby's bottom! I read from a dermatologist that you should put this stuff on after you cleanse and while your face is still wet. It's amazing!,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"After cleansing with Neutrogena cleanser and toner, then apply this product. Can use day or night or both.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have used several moisturizers and this one is the best by far. Its light and lasts all day,3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"There's many bad reviews on this mask but it's actually great, it's very hydrating and it makes your skin feel great. It is a little confusing to put on if it's your first time but over all it's amazing, 100% recommend.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"applying this burns my skin! i thought that maybe that was a sign that it was working, but then a day or two later i notice some peels around my nose and eyes. i thought that might've just been sunburn, considering the fact that i used this during the summer, so i kept using it. the more and more i used it, the more and more my skin kept peeling. it looked so awful, i had to wear sunglasses everywhere i went. maybe my skin just isn't compatible with what's in this product.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This was a great daytime moisturizer on my oily skin. I loved the consistency and it helped my skin feel moisturized without a greasy feeling that I get with most other moisturizers. However, it has a very strong scent that I couldn't get over. I usually don't mind fragrance in my skincare products but this felt like applying fabric softener to my face. If this were unscented I'd totally buy again, but as it stands, I won't be repurchasing.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have really dry skin, and I've tried all kinds of low end and high end moisturizer. This has become my favorite so far.

This has been a game changer to my skin care routine.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This dries down matte so I don't suggest wearing it with foundation unless it is moisturizing. It feels amazing and not greasy whatsoever.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Okay so I really wanted to like this, but this was one of the worst Purchase I've ever made. I picked this up as a temporary replacement for my Clinique moisture surge after hearing it was a dupe. It does not compare in any area except maybe the overall texture of the product itself. The first thing I noticed as soon as I opened it was the strong Fragrance which I'm not a fan of Due to sensitivities, it feels very refreshing upon application with a nice cooling Affect. After 1 day of using it I noticed my skin was a little More irritated then normal and my rosacea was inflamed, move on to day 2 and my face is completely broken out with a cystic acne Flare up all over my cheeks, jawline, and hairline. My Rosacea is inflamed and peeling in spots. I'm very disappointed in the quality and ingredients in this product Especially coming from Neutrogena a brand we are supposed to trust for sensitive skin. It took me over 5 months to get my cystic acne and RosaceaI calmed and almost completely gone I'm very upset I have to try and do it all over again and this was the only added new product in my routine the other products I've been using for months.I will not repurchase or recommend",4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This gave me a stinging / burning sensation when applying. I still used it for a few days. Felt like my skin was moisturized at first then a few hours later was back to super dry. Ill be switching back to Clinique Moisture Surge,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have acne prone dry/oily skin and I have been battling extremely dry skin for a couple months now.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Just tried it but like it so far,1,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"You advertise yourself as the epitome of skin care health and well being . I purchased this today . Stupidly - instead of reading ingredients , I was in a hurry and I thought to trust such a reputable brand. My mistake... because when I got home and looked over the ingredient list while unpacking it - this stuff contains 5 (YES FIVE) different types of dimethicone. In fact, hyaluronic acid isn't even listed until the very bottom which means they maybe only put a drop of it per each 100 gallons - I mean seriously that little . But hey, who cares right? With that much dimethicone, your face will look smooth and plump (that is: until u wash it off) . This stuff is about as useful as splashing your face with toilet water and Vaseline and calling it a wrinkle cure. We need to hold our beauty companies to MUCH higher standards. If we can create massive changes in how many shades a foundation can be in... why can't we make them stop lying to us about what we are putting on our precious skin???",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I actually liked this moisturizer, it made my face soft. BUT why did they need to add blue dye to it?? This makes it all the scarier considering that my skin ""soaks"" it up. Regardless of how my skin feels after I use it, this is so unnecessary. Will not be buying or recommending.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This cream is better than most expensive creams. I used so many others and as soon as I switched to this.... Bam oils controlled and face less red. I will make sure to never stray from this ever.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,nope definitely not for me. i wanted to like this product I've been looking for a moisturizer with hyaluronic in it but this is not it burns everytime i put it on broke me out around my mouth with a red painful rash that didn't go away for almost 2 weeks. buyers beware,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Received a counterfeit product. Please be careful and check batch codes when you receive items!,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Love this product!,5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This is my favorite facial moisturizer. The only one I use. It has a great light scent & the only one I trust for my sensitive skin.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"i feel like most sheet masks leave my skin worse off than it was before i used it because most sheet masks have fragrance in them. these have a literal gel sheet, not a fabric/cotton feeling one, and it's fully saturated with product. it's so moisturizing and it's the perfect pick me up that actually stays on your face and doesn't slide off!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I use this morning and night. It is lightweight and hydrating. Goes on smoothly and has a cooling effect until it dries. It wears great under foundation if you wait until it dries before you put on primer or foundation.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"i've used the hydro boost line for what feels like forever and i can safely say their water gel moisturizer is my favorite thing ever!! so light weight, cooling, hydrating, and smells so light and clean!! it really does make a difference of how fresh & hydrated my face looks, and once it soaks into the skin, that's an all day 24/7 hydrating dream!! fav fav fav!!!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This moisturizer is everything. It's the only moisturizer that doesn't make my skin burn when it's dry or irritated, and it doesn't cause breakouts. I had a big dry patch on my jawline/chin and this stuff took care of it in 3 days. You can literally lather it on and it won't make your skin feel greasy or clogged. I use this in the summer and winter, morning and night. I don't love the price so I tried using a generic Meijer brand that said it had the same ingredients, but it made my skin burn. Neutrogena Hydroboost is the only one for me!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love this moisturizer! BUUUUUT, I will not but at ulta again. I was wondering around the skin care section in target and found this same moisturizer for $16.99.. that's a big price difference. Love you ulta but definitely not enough to spend an extra $8 on my moisturizer!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This is one of the better face gels I've used. It is very light and a small dab is sufficient in covering most of your face! It also feels soothingly cool and does not leave residue like some creams. I highly recommend this product!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I don't usually write reviews at all because I don't ever really find a product good enough to review but I used this and it skin instantly absorbed it and my skin looked fresher and felt more hydrated.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This is the only sheet mask I've tried that covers my whole face. I love the hyaluronic acid serum used and I ended up buying the HydroBoost facial cleanser, face gel and body gel. Very good line. The products are nice and hydrating and the sheet mask feels amazing!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This actually works! Most face moisturizers break me out and do not hydrate any dry areas I have. This didn't make my oily areas worse or breakout and made a noticeable difference on any dry areas I have. I'm so glad I found a moisturizer that works for my combo oily / dry skin that isn't overly expensive or breaks me out! I recommend giving it a try if you're at your wits end with facial moisturizer and give it a go - very friend who has tried it loves it also!,4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This gel soaks quickly into Your skin and leaves no residue. My face felt very velvety afterward.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I think I have very dry skin and this instantly feels so hydrating! I would definitely recommend it to anyone. You don't need too much product either. My skin feels soft after I use it too! No harsh scent or any scent at all really. I will definitely buy the larger size as soon as I run out of this one!,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Ok first I have to say it's pretty expensive for neutrogena but it is a great moisturizer. It didn't make my face red like some of the reviews say but I kinda made my face break out a little. I am a teenager so i could have just woken up w hormonal pimples but it was just a little random that I put it on the a few hours later had pimples. I really do think u should try it though because it is a really good moisturizer but didn't quite work for me I might try it again in a few years but for now no.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"At the beginning of the year I had a sudden outbreak of moderate to severe hormonal acne. My dermatologist told me I needed to find an oil free moisturizer. This blew up online so I decided to try it. My skin was oily and (obviously) acne prone. Initially I wasn't sure I liked it because it didn't feel like it sunk into my skin. It did not, however, break me out so I continue using it. After awhile it was a good moisturizer that I was impressed by. I am searching for a new moisturizer now for two reasons. 1) The price of this is too high for what you get. I use just a bit on my finger tips in the morning and the jar empties FAST 2) While My skin has improved a lot my pores look HUGE and the blackheads on my nose that were slowly disappearing are now as stubborn as ever. The only thing that could cause this in my routine is the moisturizer. I believe this is a moisturizer for normal skin to slightly oily skin types.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This is the BEST face mask I've ever used! It feels soo good on your face and used my rose quarts face roller with it to help get the full effect. Highly recommend!,4,,

I have extremely dry skin thats acne prone, flakey and constantly washed due to covid-19. Recently, none of my lightweight moisturizers would penetrate my skin well enough and my thicker moisturizers would just sit on top of my skin. After applying this just once, I was able to soften my skin up to the point I was able to rub the extra skin off. Disgusting, yes but very satisfying to finally have soft skin again. I'm only taking one star off for the fact that its scented. It's not the biggest deal once you massage it in you won't smell it. I just personally don't believe that skincare should be scented.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I get horribly dry and sensitive skin. At first this was amazing but then after 2 months I started having issues. This wasn't doing anything to help my flaking skin and only aggravated it causing my sensitivity to intensify and cause a burning sensation. It's probably fine for people with regular sling but people with sensitive skin beware.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I noticed a big difference after adding this product to my skin care routine. I use it immediately after taking a shower or washing my face to keep my skin from feeling over-dried. It gives me a dewy, smooth, clean feeling instead of the sticky or oily feel of other products I've tried.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I use this product morning and night after cleansing and before applying makeup. It's a great hydrating product that won't clog your pores. My finicky skin that's dry in some places and oily in others has never been more even and uniform. I love this water gel!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"One of the best hydration masks I've ever used. The fact it's two pieces took some time to adjust, but the end result (I did 30 mins) is SO worth it!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love this product it's so light, keeps my skin hydrated and soft.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This face lotion is a repeat purchase for me. I have trouble finding face lotions that keep my skin hydrated in dry weather, this one is great. I will purchase again.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I use this mask in my night time routine. I use it before putting on my night cream. After removing it I massage the serum in and let it sit for about 10 minutes.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I use it in the mornings preferably but could use it either way. I use it to waken up my skin and hydrate with out a greasy or heavy feeling on my face.,1,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Not hydrating at all and very hard to keep on your face. It is a gel, it is two pieces, and the bottom piece just slips off your face. The Oozoo mask is much better.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I personally love this product! I tried the mini first, since it is expensive and I would recommend doing that if you're a first time purchaser. I love how lightweight it is! My skin instantly soaks it up AND it doesn't make me break up! I've read a lot of the comments that said it did make them break out, but I had the opposite experience. It's so hydrating and just made the overall appearance of my face healthier.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"In the beginning I thought this moisturizer was amazing, but recently I have realized that i have been breaking out for the entire month that I've been using it and it has been giving me chemical burns. I love neutrogena, but this moisturizer is certainly not for me.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I was really excited to try this with all of the glowing reviews and due to its manageable price point. Unfortunately, this definitely not only broke me out with some deep acne, but also gave me a painful and not so great looking red and scaly rash around my mouth (wasn't just a small rash - it was very obvious). This product was the culprit. I hesitated putting it on my face again after the first time I tried it because the fragrance is unnecessarily strong, and I like scented things. I could smell it for hours after I put it on. Also, the product has dye/coloring in it which seems like just another unnecessary ingredient, especially for a face cream. Lastly, I don't know why companies are still putting products in tubs, especially ones you put on a place you do NOT want bacteria. The only positive about this product was the consistency, which was smooth and easy to spread on your face.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This is like literally using water on your skin, there is no body, it does nothing for my skin, it didn't live up to it's expectations",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Doesn't do enough by itself. Need moisterizer too.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Very Best for skin hydration and leaves skin glowing and soft. A fresh look!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I really wanted this to work for me being as sooo many different people recommend it. My skin type is combo and occasional acne, but some products will make me break out, and this just so happened to be one of those products for me ‚òπÔ∏è didn't make my skin feel hydrated just made me feel oily.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I love this so much !! I'm got the mini just to try it out and it makes my skin feel and look amazing!! I love the way that my face feels hydrated and fresh but doesn't look oily ! I'm looking forward to buying the bigger version once I finish the mini !! I definitely recommend this product !!!! One tiny little set back is that it irritates me just a tiny bit around my nose and chin but not a lot so that's good !,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I love this product for the summer because it feels cool when you put it on your face and it's great for day time moisturizer but I don't find that it's moisturizing enough for night time since my skin is very dry!,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Amazing! Try it out!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I've been using this for years and it makes my skin feel super soft. Lasts all day and doesn't have that heavy lotion feeling when it is applied. The fragrance is stronger than normal, but it doesn't affect me personally.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I typically use this product in the morning after cleansing my face. I get redness easily since I have dry and sensitive skin, but this always brings hydration to my face!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"As an after-wash moisturizer I was not impressed. It's kind of greasy,feels like it sits on the skin, then an hour later you have dry patches (?)",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I've been using this for awhile now, and it is my Holy Grail! Since I started using this gel, my face has felt so smooth and baby soft. I have combination skin, and I'll occasionally get some acne and/or really dry skin. Because of this, it took me a long time to find a moisturizer that was super hydrating but not oily or greasy. I tried a few other brands, and they were alright, but this is my ALL TIME FAVORITE! The results are almost immediate; I'll wake up the next morning with super soft skin. I 100% recommend this, and I am NEVER buying anything other than this.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This product offers a nice almost silky feeling base after applying, however... that's due to the moisture sucking ingredient Glycerin that's very high on the ingredients list. Glycerin creates a soft almost satin feeling texture that can feel moisturizing, however it's actually drawing moisture away from your skin. It also contains dyes and fragrance even though online it claims it doesn't. Maybe the formula changed? I do love the fact this moisturizer is cheap and effective and has Hyaluronic acid, it does work for a lot of people who DON'T have sensitive skin and don't care about ingredients, only outcome.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This moisturizer feels amazing when you apply it! I love the water consistency of it and it doesn't leave my face feeling oily. Occasionally I will get dry patches and this product doesn't really help with my super dry skin. But it's a great daily moisturizer when my skin is more normal! Would buy again as a summer moisturizer,3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,it works so well. makes your face feel clean and soft.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"this is a good water/gel based moisturizer for acne prone or oily/combination skin, but i do have to say i did not like the fragrance in this moisturizer. it smelled a little bit stronger than i would like it too. but it's good for the summertime or more oilier skin.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I heard great things about this gel moisturizer and finally decided to try it. I got the mini just in case I didn't like it. But I love it! Feels great on my skin and really hydrates. 10/10 would recommend,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"After hearing tons of great reviews on this product I thought I'd give it a try. I do tend to have oily non-sensitive or acne-prone skin. After a few days of using this, i noticed tiny raised bumps all over my cheeks that were not pimples. Thinking that this or another product could have been the cause I stopped using both and slowly reintroduced this moisturizer first. Immediately on application I felt my face BURN. This product contains silicones and fragrance/dye which is not good for the skin. Do not recommend it.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Lie down and relax while your skin is deeply hydrated.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"So I've used this for a couple weeks now and I'm not sure this is compatible with my skin. I have oily skin, it's a little sensitive but I don't really breakout much, I don't have acne issues. I mostly wanted something to help with aging as I'm in my late 30s and with my oiliness. But this is actually making my face itch and feel more sensitive. As if I exfoliated too much or something. It also burns as I apply it. I know with any irritation, it's time to stop using the product. I think it's a great gel for oily skin as it doesn't make my face more oily and my makeup sits well on top of it. But I'm too old for itchy face and the possibility of acne. So it's a no for me. If you have acne issues I'd say Neutrogena is a great and affordable for step. But if you don't have acne, this might be too strong and too irritating. I really have to send this back.....fast.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This is the best moisturizer! I feel like my skin is 16 again!!! I'm a plump young chicken! My skin soaks it right up, it doesn't feel heavy, it's light & refreshing. The next morning I can visibly see a difference in hydration in my skin after using this product.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I LOVE this moisturizer. I suffer from rosacea and peri-oral dermatitis and unfortunately for me its very hard to find a good moisturizer. This calms my skin at the same time moisturizes it.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I looOoOve the texture of this! It reminds me of Tatcha's water cream moisturizer. Smells amazing, seeps into the skin in seconds, really plumps and smoothens.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,For hydrating skin,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have ridiculously sensitive fair skin with rosacea. I hate the feeling of lotion on my skin. I sweat a lot and specially right out of the shower. My skin just doesn't want to absorb lotion and it drives me crazy all sticky and wet for 40+ mins. So I've been trying all the gel and oil moisturizers. This one is the best! You apply is and instantly your skin drinks it. I can put makeup on minutes after i apply it. I use to have to skip moisturizer under makeup because it would just sit on top of my skin. This moisturizer has change my skin healthy and my makeup game! All my makeup looks and applies so smooth now!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This moisturizer is amazing! I used to work for Lanc√¥me and have tried many high-end moisturizers and this one is actually my favorite so far, I've been using it for a few weeks since my Energie de Vie ran out. I have combo skin that gets oily in the summer, but this is lightweight and manages to keep my skin feeling hydrated and supple without being greasy. It smells great too, a very light clean fragrance. I recommend it to everyone now üòä",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This is a great basic moisturizer. I don't like the fragrance. If fragrance doesn't bother you then you should definitely try it! I was kind of dissapointed because it barely lasted me a month. Next time put it in a bigger bottle and I would repurchase.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,So refreshing and moisturizing!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I bought this since I've read such good reviews about this product helping those with dry sensitive skin but soon realized after using it that the next day my skin felt even drier and was flaking! I even had small little acne happening around my chin where I'm the most driest at. However, when I did my skincare routine of Clinique cleansers, Clinique toner, Olay facial mist, burt's bees eye cream, a serum, I would finally put on the neutrogena product. So, essentially had to use a lot of products beforehand so that neutrogena would not dry up and flake my skin again",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I absolutely love this moisturizer and have repurchased it many times. It is super hydrating and cooling and you can feel that effect on your skin.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This was definitely a weird product to get used to but after 2 weeks I really enjoy this product.

I would definitely give this one time as it takes a little bit but after about a week my skins texture was noticeably better and my skin feels so much better,4.4,,

I always go back to this one. It feels amazing on my acne prone oily skin and it hydrates my skin really well. I don't recommend this to dry skin people because it's very light. I also don't recommend piling on too much skincare products after applying this moisturizer because it will pill. Overall this product is amazing!,3,,

But after a couple weeks I got red bumps all around my mouth and I was really confused what was up, but then I realized when I stopped using this stuff the bumps went away.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This product has seriously saved my skin. I have oily skin, and before using this moisturizer daily, I had an extremely hard time stoping the shine on my face as well as preventing breakouts from all the oils. This is so hydrating that it has trained my skin to not produce so much oil, and I have really clear skin now. I also deal with eczema and haven't had any reoccur on my face since starting to use this. I'm in love with how it absorbs into your skin as if there's nothing there, but still keeps you moisturized. It just feels amazing to apply. The price and amount you get is a bit of a draw back, but when you compare that to how amazing it works, and the higher price of similar products, it's totally worth it.

I gave this product many tries because I thought the pimples were caused by something else but I'm certain this is the reason.

But the serum wasn't quite enough for mu dry winter skin, and the bottle suggest following up with this. I started to break out in pimples right away after using this just a few times. I don't have many breakouts, so it was easy to narrow it down. I stopped using it for a bit and my skin cleared right up. Tried it again and had the same results. I can see that the product does have the potential to be a great moisturizer if you get lucky enough to not break out from it. But I can't wear it even once without zits. And I don't typically have any breakouts at all. So unfortunately this was a waste of money for me.",4.4,,

Because of it's wonderful consistency, it feels so refreshing and it really absorbs quickly, so simply the feeling of putting it on your face is just so nice and doesn't feel gross like putting on a lot of other really heavy moisturizers.

I'm sure we've all had an annoying mask that we had to readjust every ten seconds- well this was one of them. I was tired of it after like, 5 minutes, and threw it away. That was a third of the time you're supposed to wear it, and my face didn't feel any different when I took it off. I was definitely not psyched about it.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I used to use this moisturizer and it was the first one I ever found to be effective for my super oily, but somewhat dehydrated, skin. I made it almost the whole way through the jar, but it always gave me a little bit of a tingly sensation, so I decided to discontinue use. Upon further investigation, it unfortunately appears that I have a sensitivity to hyaluronic acid, so I couldn't use this or any of the other products in the line, but it did generally work as a moisturizer for oily skin, so I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who doesn't have ridiculously sensitive skin like me. (BTW, for anyone who does, the replacement I found that worked great for me is the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel. Not the lotion+, not the oil control gel, though that might work great too, haven't tried, and definitely not the hydrating jelly, as that also has hyaluronic acid).",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"The mask hydrates well-if you can get it on and keep it on. The backing was half falling off the mask as I was pulling it out of the package, and the mask was so slippery I had to slide it back up my face until it dried a bit (so it's tacky enough to stick). Neutrogena is very generous with the serum, though. I am frugal so I continued to use leftover serum in the package a few more times the following days. I like to cotton masks better than this slippery gel substance.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I love this moisturizer! I didn't think I was a gel moisturizer kind of girl but this is my all time fav! Love the way this smells and the way my skin feels after. It's cooling and hydrating. Not too greasy. I've already repurchased!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love this, seriously. I'm incredibly picky about moisturizers and I have finally found the one. I first bought the little travel size to try it out and just bought the full size. It's super hydrating, you can tell it actually absorbs and doesn't sit on top of the skin. The reason I bought in the first place is because I think gel moisturizers feel way better than creams which run the risk of being greasy even if they're oil free. Becuase of that I believe it would work for every skin type. Since I've incorporated this into my skincare routine my skin in smoother and has a more even tone. It's even healed up a weird flaky dry irritated patch I had near my chin that I couldn't get rid of. This is the holy grail and its not very expensive!! You won't regret this!",5,,

Becuase of that I believe it would work for every skin type. Since I've incorporated this into my skincare routine my skin in smoother and has a more even tone. It's even healed up a weird flaky dry irritated patch I had near my chin that I couldn't get rid of. This is the holy grail and its not very expensive!! You won't regret this!",1,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Are use this product every morning. Coverage is great and it lasts a long time.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I was looking for an alcohol-free moisturizer because my skin is so sensitive and was recommended this. It worked for the first few days, but then began to leave my skin red, irritated, and developing extremely dry and flaky skin. My skin goes between dry and oily, but this was the driest and flakiest it had ever been! Would not recommend.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I recently ordered this gel and have to return it, because it made me break out. I have had this issue before with other Neutrogena Hydro Boost products but did not make the connection until I began to use this one. I may just be reacting to something in the products for this line. With that said, Hydro Boost Water Gel did make my skinny feel hydrated.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This product doesn't make your skin really greasy it actually makes it really soft and it feels very hydrating on the skin. For me my skin is very sensitive but this is one lotion that has not made my face red.,2,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I love how my skin feels it feels so soft and smooth also my skin is kind of oily but this mask helped me so much,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,excellent,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I was a little skeptical at first so I got the travel size (lasted a month) and I loved it! I have combo skin, 21 and in a fairly hot and sometimes humid climate, and this is so nice and light weight but hydrating. It absorbs nicely and I don't feel sticky, heavy or oily after I use it. My skin feels soft to the touch and I love the smell though I can see why it may be off putting to some. Just bought the full size and will probably re purchase again!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I use this product as a night eye cream, and it keeps my eyes looking great",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have very oily and acne prone skin. I have always used mild products to moisturize. I like that this hydroboost gel has HA in it, which I'm also new to using but understand I definitely need at my age. I got very little dryness from using this twice a day for the last four days. I'd imagine if I had dryer skin it would be worse, so keep that in mind if your skin is dry. Although this product smells very good, it is very strong. I usually prefer products that don't have fragrance added to them. But this one is worth the trade off!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I heard so many good things about this mask. This was my first time trying it. Didn break me out but also didn't moisturize or do anything good for my skin. Had added fragrance witch is not good for your skin,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Super bummed about this. Luckily I bought the mini version to test it out since it's pretty expensive. This actually kind of burned my skin a little bit too which is not normal for me. At first I thought it was maybe disagreeing with other products I was using but continued use showed me that wasnt the case. It also made me break out horribly!!! I'm almost 26 years old and havnt had a breakout like this in over a decade! Crazy! I'd give it to a friend but I dont want this to hurt anyone else,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I use these face masks after I cleanse and leave on for 15 mins!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love this product so much! I have very sensitive skin and I am very active at the gym.. this product does not break me out and is lightweight enough to wear at the gym and also works extremely well under my makeup! They have one with and without sunscreen which is perfect for me! Before using this product I would spend so much money trying to find the right moisturizer for me! A bonus is that I love the way this product smells! Heads up........... Although I LOVE this, do NOT get the matching face wash! It made my skin so dry and lifeless...",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"It was ok. I've been having really dry flaky skin on my chin and i was hoping it would give it a boost of hydration and help with the dryness, but it did not. Also, i just feel it dries very quickly and doesn't make your skin feel smooth.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love this mask. I'm on a pretty severe acne treatment and have been looking for something to help relieve my dry, chapped, extra sensitive skin. After talking to my dermatologist, I gave this a go. It feels so nice! I keep a few in the fridge for a pre-bedtime mini facial on the days my skin just won't quit. I'm not so sure oily skin types will enjoy this mask, it it's definitely a winner for normal to very dry skin types.",5,,

It felt so smooth and refreshing to the touch but almost immediately after my face started to burn. My face has never been so dry and burned. I used it for 5 days, thinking it would adjust but nope it didnt. I looked it up and couldn't believe how many people/articles there were complaining about this product causing a severe reaction. I wouldn't even take the chance on this product since there are so many different options. I stopped using this product today and I hope the burning stops and goes away immediately. It's awful.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I never ever review products, but this moisturizer here gave me the worst allergic reaction ever. I've tried the makeup remover towelettes and they were harsh on my face so I should have known. Just left my face super dry, tingly , and red.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I love this I have been using this for two years now a lot of ppl get confused bc if you have dry skin this one isn't for you... you need the water cream my mom using that one and she has very dry skin .... on the water cream it says for dry to very dry skin.... i seen some bad reviews on ppl with dry skin so hopefully this helps,5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I acknowledge that we all have different skin types. unfortunately for me this product was a nightmare. the product itself was very velvety and smelled decent. However, I had a terrible reaction to it. I broke out in hives, it itched, my face turned red and I got new zits. I used it for 3 days and stopped for a couple of days. My skin still hasn't cleared up and it's so dry to the point it hurts. it has great reviews but it just didn't work for me. I have combination skin. Hopefully my review gives insight of possible side effects. I wish it would have worked out.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This thick sheet mask is awesome. Stays on my face and it comes in two parts - divided half down face. It is fabulous for my super dry skin. After a few back to back day uses, made me break out. So would recommend using every few days, or allow a couple days between uses",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Amazing everything it says it will give it does. I use the Lanc√¥me masks as well and I honestly think I get the same results for a fraction of the cost.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"My friend and I both purchased this moisturizer. One of us has dry skin, the other oily. We both got horrible dry patches shortly after using this.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I really like this product, it works so well for me. I have combination skin and sometimes really dry once I get out of the shower. I put this on right after and it really makes my skin feel so hydrated. I love it. I will continue to buy it. I do not like that Ulta raised the price on this moisturizer, but I know I'm able to get it at another competitor for a cheaper price.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,used to absolutely LOVE this moisturizer but after neutrogena raised the price not sure if I want to keep purchasing it. NO7 has a great dupe.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I love this this is very hydrating,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I am obsessed. This is a unique product in the fact that you can control how much moisture you need. You can layer on as much as you'd like without having any build up. It actually keeps your skin moisturized all day with no need to reapply.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This is an amazing dupe for Clinique moisture surge. I feel that this absorbs a lot better than the other moisturizer and has a more cooling effect so it's perfect as a summertime moisturizer and cooling on sunburns as well. Noticeably leaves my skin moisturized and plump and looking very healthy as well can't express how amazing this works,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have a dry face sometimes in winter and this face mask helped my face so much,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Love love love. Will totally be buying again!! I highly recommend this product for dry, dull skin! It even has flaps to cover your lips & eyes so it's great for relaxing with some music (which is exactly what I did).",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I usually use Belif Aquabomb but dang that stuff is expensive! Hydroboost is a great daily replacement and can be used as an overnight mask to leave your skin feeling silky smooth in the morning,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This is the best sheet mask I've ever used and I'm at the point now where I won't use any other one. The mask comes in two parts so it fits your face comfortably and doesn't slide down over time. The hydration is unbeatable.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I've been using this for over five months and I've definitely had better moisturizers. My combo skin soaks it up within seconds and is still dry afterwords. I have to apply it several times in one session in order to notice a difference. Even though the price is moderate compared to other moisturizers, I think cheaper stuff works better in my opinion.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Honestly is one of the best face masks I've ever used. Only downside is getting it out of the packaging. It's really sticky.,3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I really love this. I am always trying to find new products to make my dry dry dry skin feel hydrated. I've gone back and forth with types of projects similar to this (some sort of water cream like this with Hyaluronic acid). LOVE THIS ONE! It is a little bit more money at ulta than the similar products, but this one is the best yet. Doesn't burn my skin, and without it for one night and morning my skin felt so dry. I realized this really really helps dry skin!!",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I love this product except for the scent. Too strong of a fragrance! I use products that are fragrance free as different scents/fragrances bother me.

If I use other products over it the fragrance comes back again strong.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I absolutely love this mask! My skin is extremely sensitive & I break out from just about any little thing. But this mask does the trick.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I ordered this moisturizer because the winter weather in my area is very unforgiving. On top of this, my apartment has poor air circulation and we use a gas heater, so our air gets very dry. I have a combination skin type. I get patches of dry and oily skin. My boyfriend on the other hand has very dry, sensitive skin. I was looking for a product that we could both use. This product is amazing for both of us. This is my first full day of using it, but I can already tell I love it. It isn't greasy and a little goes a VERY long way. I love this moisturizer because I can tell it's for all day wear. When I first put it on, I didn't feel much of a difference, but throughout the day my face has gotten very soft and supple. My dry patches are gone! My boyfriend said his face hasn't felt this good with a moisturizer in a long time. He has very sensitive skin and he can usually tell right away if something will be irritating because it'll burn. He hasn't burned all day and also feels that it improves throughout the day. When it arrived in the mail, it seemed a little small. I was a little discouraged. But I only needed the tiniest dab to cover my entire face and neck. Same with my boyfriend. Since it's a little pricey we plan to take turns purchasing this product. I love that it fits both of our very different skin types so well!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,My brother and I both used this product. He's been using it for years and have very dry skin. He recommended it to me since he likes it so much. He also has sensitive skin but he's never had issues with it. I started using this in the summer because my regular moisturizer was too heavy as I have combination skin that gets oily in the summer.But I quickly realized something was wrong with my skin. Whenever I put the product on the smell was overwhelming and my skin felt irritated and slightly burned. It took me a while to realize this product was causing irritation and my skin wouldn't stop breaking out. Finally stopped using the product and switched back to my old moisturizer and my skin has calmed down significantly.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,There is plenty of serum in the packet but seems most of it stays there instead of sticking to the sheet mask. The mask itself slid around and did not adhere well to my face. I kept it on for the minimum 15 minutes and then applied the remaining serum from the packet 3 times (lots of juice) before finishing my routine. The serum is very light and hydrating with a light scent. It was great for my oily skin but I won't be repurchasing because the mask is too much of a hassle.,3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I bought this moisturizer for my daughter. I gave her my leftover one couple years ago and she really liked it. Then got her brother using it. It's a great moisturizer for kids after they wash their face with their face brush her face gets dry as well in the summer and the winter,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I purchased this mask yesterday and used it last night. It was easy to apply although slippery but it does have gel so that's no biggie. I kept it on for 15 minutes like instructed from the packaging and after my face felt so hydrated and smooth! It deep cleaned my pores! I was honestly shook. Looove this one!,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"if i could give it zero stars i would!!!! I bought this because my skin is combo dry/oily and it was recommended by several people with sensitive skin.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I bought this and the serum at the same time, and I noticed how quick it absorbs into the skin. At first I thought it was great because I hate that sticky feeling while you wait for things to sink in. However, I noticed how matte my face would look afterwards and it still feels a bit tight and dry. After about a week, I've noticed these tiny whiteheads that are popping up near my nose and mouth, and I don't breakout there or have these particular breakouts. At first i thought it was the fragrance, because the product is HEAVILY fragranced. As I got to looking at the ingredients, and one of the biggest/highest ingredients is dimethicone! I really wished this worked for me, but with the fragrance, dimethicone, breakouts, and not moisturizing, I just cant recommend this.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I wash my face in the shower then I moisturize with this product,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This mask is wonderful. Does everything it claims to do. But the WORK i have to put in tp get this mask on is kind of annoying only because its a 2 piecer and if your not Careful the serum that saturates the mask will drip out immediately. ( i like to save the extra to rub in after) this is not a multitasking mask and what i mean is you cant be walking around doing whatever else with this on because it will slip and move. So i suggest if you have the extra 10-15 minutes to just lay down and relax while waiting for this to work its magic then go for it ! But if your looking for something you can quickly slap on and move on then this isnt the one .,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I am someone who takes pride in my skincare. I read ingredients and educate myself on best practices. I invest in my skincare, but the most expensive isn't aways the best and, likewise, the most affordable isn't bad in and of itself. The latter couldn't be more true with these Hydro Boost Hydrating Hydrogel Masks. They are easily comparable to more expensive masks on the market. They out-perform some of their higher priced competitors with accessibility, comfort, size, and ingredients. I've been using these after going in hard with a new retinoid and they are soothing and hydrating. Make sure to follow with a moisturizer!",3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,It moisturizes without feeling heavy.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Not sure why this is marketed for dry skin because it's not hydrating. It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling tight no matter how much I apply. I also think it's breaking me out probably because my skin is trying to compensate for the lack of moisture. The only positive is that this didn't cause any irritation for my mildly sensitive skin. I feel like this product would only be good for oily skin if anything. Will be returning.,5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I bought this out of recommendation from a dermatologist.... yikes. The instant I put it on my face, my skin dried out.

I thought it was my face wash, so stupidly, I tried to add a little more... cue the actual visible sight of redness and bumps breaking out across my skin. I had to cleanse and remove the lotion, and find another moisturizer for it to finally calm down. While this doesn't have many ingredients, I've never had an allergic reaction to a skincare item, and this did NOT sit well with me.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love this mask as a pick me up to refresh and hydrate my skin. This mask has a very interesting jelly texture and feels great when applied, I'm not that amused at the fact that it has two separate pieces, as you have to figure out placing for these masks to stay on without falling off. I'm not a big fan of heavily scented face products this particular one isn't as strong as any of the other hydro boost products. I love putting it in the refrigerator for 10 mins prior to use. I like to use this mask in the morning but does work very well at night layered with thicker night creams. These masks have a lot of extra serum if want to get more bang for your buck you can pour the leftover product into an empty serum bottle and use a couple more times. I highly recommend the purifying and brightening masks in this same line.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"It felt good on the skin and was definitely moisturizing but made me break out... I do love the body lotion they make, but it's kind of concerning they have the same fragrance.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I would love this product more if it didn't contain dimethicone. It can clog pores especially with acne prone/oily skin. And i do have that problem, but the hyaluronic acid really does moisturize the skin.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This makes my skin feel so good. I get dry patches and this helps get rid of them literally over night. I was a littler concerned about it being a gel texture but it's great. I also love the way it smells. I have sensitive skin but I didn't have any issues with this product.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I've recently been using the Clinique 72 hour moisture surge, and I heard this product was a dupe. Once I ran out, I purchased the hydro Boost water gel and regretted it soon after. I should've tried the hydro Boost cream instead. Unlike the cream, the water gel has fragrance in it which in my opinion completely ruins this product. I have sensitive skin. Sometimes, this product will cause my skin to burn but that's mostly only when it's been going through the gigs (wind burn, sun damage, dentist appointment lol). Anyways, I can never use this moisturizer alone as it doesn't give me enough moisture. That really sucks because this moisturizer isn't cheap. Either way, I will give the hydro Boost cream a shot once I run out of this tub. This product does have some positives and could be really nice if you have oily skin. I am very acne prone and this didn't break me out. It is super lightweight and not greasy. Additionally, it does a really great job at smoothing texture thanks to dimethicone which isn't the awful ingredient that some people make it out to be. It's actually beneficial but can create the illusion of more moisturized skin.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have very dry skin year round. I use this product when my skin is feeling dry and also before my makeup. It works wonders for me. The mask has some texture to it so it doesn't fall off. I leave it on until dry for maximum use.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"ok I tried so many brands of moisturizer and they all broke me out or gave me some kind of problem. This stuff was worth the hype. It makes my skin feel so nice, I apply it in the morning and before bed after washing my face. If you're sensitive to heavier creams I suggest you give this a try.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love how lightweight this product is. It's not greasy, and it smells great! A little goes a long way, too- just a little tap of a fingertip is enough for my whole face! Will definitely buy again!",3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I bought the cleanser and this water gel because the reviews convinced me but please do yourself a favor and save your money. My skin is combination, oily on the t-zone and the rest is very dry. I put it on the dry spots clearly because it's to hydrate and it soon enough began to burn my face, I'm guessing because of the strong mfn fragrance it has. After I took it off my face it turned red. Don't buy this, save your money.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This mask broke me out with itchy skin almost immediately! I thought the tingle was the mask working but it was my skin becoming irritated. So disappointed because my skin was in great condition before this. Do not recommend this mask.,3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I want to start by saying, Neutrogena, please never change anything about this product. For me, as an extremely oily, dehydrated, sensitive, acne prone gal I struggle to find products that work for my skin. I'm Korean so I naturally always gravitate towards k and j beauty products. They work better for my skin. Over the last few years I've struggled with cystic acne so I have to be really careful with what I put on my skin. I try to look for non-comedogenic products to avoid further breakouts. I read a really great review on this product from an article I found on pinterest after searching best products for my skin type. The reviewer's review really checked all the boxes off my list for what I was looking for so I reached for this right away. I was so pleased after trying this. Experienced no breakouts, pore blurring results and sat super well under make-up. I never had any issues with dryness and felt this product plumped up areas like smile lines. I'm always on the hunt for something better with everything I use, so I'll try something different for a bit but I keep finding myself coming back to this product. I've tried really expensive to not so expensive moisturizers trying to find that HG, but I honestly think this product may be that for me. I've been using it for 3 years now and once I leave, I always come back to it. This is the one moisturizer I've repurchased the most because I love it that much. It really stinks to read it hasn't worked for other folx, but as someone who struggles with most products, I really hope Neutrogena doesn't change anything about this one and I hope those can find something that works for them too.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I'm so sad to see people not like this product! I have very sensitive skin that downright just sucks!

It is not greasy and my skin feels so soft. I put this on in the morning before my primer and it is perfect! In the evening I do my night routine and put this on to sleep and perfect! The one thing that I will say is that I'm very disappointed in the way that the other products in this line work. I purchased the water gel with the sunscreen added and it was HORRIBLE! I also purchased the city shield and had terrible results. I suppose it depends on each person and their skin. I did love this product enough to try and get the whole line, but this is the only thing I've found that I can stick to and actually works amazing. I can't go without it!",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have a problem with dry skin. I used to wear foundation and see that my skin was peeling underneath. After every shower and face wash, I use this and my face feels sooooo smooth. A little goes a long way. If you put too much you can actually feel it on your skin but with the right amount you can't feel it. Now that I use this, I don't see anymore peeling underneath my foundation.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This broke me out so bad and I've never experienced a product breaking me out. After a week and half of use I noticed all these little tiny bumps on my cheeks that looked like white heads or something and I put a face mask on and it made them stand out SO MUCH they looked huge and my pores were HUGE I was so scared because tbh I have clear skin and get minimal pimples so this was new and I knew it was this moisturizer because it was the only thing I changed from my skin routine and I wasn't on my period. This wasn't for me I guess even though to heard it was great I'll pass.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Its very cool to the touch and lightweight on your face! Definitely love it. I will definitely buy it again. And ive got tons of products in my bathroom but this one is one of my favs. Doesnt break my fave out or make it feel oily. I was skeptical at first because nothing seems to help but this one is fantastic. I now own all of the neutrogena city shield and hydro boost creams and serums,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Amazing. I've used the Hydro Boost gel sheet mask on a regular basis before purchasing this, so I knew what to expect for the smell, which doesn't bother me at all. The product melts right into your skin, leaving a smooth, natural finish. I originally purchased the trial size, but once it's gone I will be buying the normal size.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This product is SUPER hydrating but I noticed when I use it I get small pimples in the middle of my forehead. If I'm super dry I'll use it on the rest of my face and skip my forehead. I tend to break out fairly easily with skincare products so this is not unusual for me.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I really wanted to like it but as soon as i got it on my skin started feeling itchy and irritated. As soon as i took it off my kin was red and had small bumps on my cheeks. Definitely not for sensitive skin.,5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Wow, best moisturizer I have ever used and I have tried many. I was prepared to spend more (and I have) but though ti would give this one a try and it was fabulous! I have been telling everyone about it. It feels really good going on, has a light fresh scent, absorbs quickly, my skin feels velvety in the morning and the oil in my skin has been reduced so much!!!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have oily/combination skin. This moisturizer is great for oily skin, especially in the morning under makeup, but it's not quite moisturizing enough for the dry patches I get on my chin/cheeks, so I have to use a different heavier one in the evenings.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have combo/oily skin, and this has worked WONDERS for me. One of the few moisturizers that don't make me an oily mess or break me out. However, it smells VERY perfumey. I don't usually have issues with fragrance, but I get terrible headaches every time I use it... Until I find a replacement (why must the fragrance free version be for dry skin!!) I'll be taking some tylenol while putting this on lol",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This mask is sooooo moisturizing and it doesn't clog poor and it feels so great!!! Worth the try!,5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,So I have very sensitive skin for a long time I literally couldn't wear any moisturizer because my skin would just breakout. But then I tried the tarte drink of H2O moisturizer and loved it. But that one is around 40 dollars which was a lot for me to spend on a moisturizer so I decided to try this one and wow I love this one. It's almost better than the tarte on 10/10 recommend!,5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I am in my early 30s and have been struggling with my under eye appearance (looked dull and lacked elasticity). I purchased both the moisturizer and eye cream (Hydro-Lift) and OMG....the skin under my eyes no longer sink in and look so supple and hydrated!! I absolutely love this product and can't wait to go back to the store to purchase additional Hydro-Boost products!!!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I feel like this is trying to be a dupe for a popular water sleeping mask of a similar color and scent, but it misses the mark. Instead of smelling light and fresh, it smells strongly like a bathroom air freshener. If you have sensitive skin or are bothered by fragrance, stay away from this product! I could maybe forgive the overuse of fragrance if it worked well, but it's honestly too lightweight for my skin type and feels slightly drying. This may be better for oily skin types, but my dry/dehydrated people should probably look elsewhere. Not worth it, especially for the price.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I already used the daily cleaner and daily moisturizer in the skin care line and while waiting to check out at the dollar store I found the mask. That's right folks not a high end, over priced pharmacy or department store but a good old affordable dollar store. Sittung at home one afternoon decided to try it , did not even use mirror to get it on perfectly. Kept it on for 25 min. and the refreshing, healthy , youthful glow after use can't be missed.",1,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have severe dry skin. No matter what I use it seems like it is never ending. I've used this mask several times now to make sure it truly works and it does. My skin feels so much better after using this. The mask is somewhat like a gel that has a ribbed side to help keep it on your face. I leave it on until it is dry. My skin is so smooth and luscious for days. Great product.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I've been a long time neutrogena fan and this does not disappoint. It feels amazing on your skin and really does plump it up. My skin feels soft and supple. It's also a great primer for your moisturizer. I think it's a lot of bang for your buck!,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,My skin is on the dry side but this just made it worse.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Love this product! I have always had a breakout-prone/oily nose and chin, and dry cheeks. So hard to get something that works! I have tried all sorts of moisturizers but none felt light enough nor helped me with the zits. My chin kept constantly breaking out. I got good results with SOS Caudalie Serum, but Neutrogena water gel is half the price and does the same thing. I have ditched all other moisturizers. I only cleanse my face morning and night and use the Neutrogena water gel at night. My skin is very smooth, bright, dewy and suddenly, after a few weeks of this routine, my chin is CLEAR! For the the first time ever. Yes, I recommend!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,great for everyday use! light weight and feels great on the skin.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Had high hopes for this product, however it has broken my skin so terribly. I regret buying this completely and I have great skin but my concern is the dryness. Around the 4th-5th day of using this I woke up to a burning red face with a prickly rash all over my forehead, cheeks, chin, everywhere. My skin looks CHEMICALLY burned. My cheeks are burned to the touch and the rash all over my forehead is disgusting. After doing a lot of review reading I learned I wasn't the only one with this reaction. Please don't take the burning sensation as ""it doing it's job"" on the first tries. I will never go back to this product, and will stay away from Neutrogena forever.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"So my skin was always normal and I never had to do anything to it. All of a sudden my face is dry and patchy... I did my research on what to do and how to fix it on a budget. If I'm going to be using this every day, it will obviously need to be repurchased somewhat often. I tried Dove first (did absolutely nothing) so then I found this... I am OBSESSED. It actually cleared my breakouts on my chin somehow. My face is SO smooth and I feel like I did before my skin got bad! Yes, the smell is strong, but I don't think it's a bad smell. I actually like it. This has quickly become my absolute favorite.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I used to have really dry skin and thanks to this lotion I no longer do,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I use this while my skin is still damp and let it soak in. Once it's dried down I add my spf and moisturizer. My skin is changed. Its amazing! I had horrendous problems with an oily t-zone. After a week or two of hydrating my skin, my t-zone is under control. I'm in love with this product and have purchased back up upon back up.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Great product. I have combination skin and it truly hydrated.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have normal with sometimes combination skin while traveling and go through a lot of moisturizers and creams. This is the absolute worst I've ever tried. I ended up with red bumps and rough, dry patches after the first use. It absorbed quickly, to a satin finish that left my skin still feeling dry. I re-applied after an hour - still too dry. The next day I tried again and even my husband commented my skin was red and asked if I was feeling well. I tested some on his face and the same thing happened - dry, rough patches except his were also itchy. Rinsed it off and our skin felt better plain, without it. Everyone raving about this product was from years ago with many new reviews reporting the same reaction. I'm thinking the formula has changed? I can't recommend against this enough.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I enjoy using this product as a quick moisturizer after cleaning my face. Lightweight and a little goes a long way,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I am a huge K beauty brand lover, and started with those, so maybe I'm more used to the way your skin feels after a mask like Tony Moly type mask. But my sister absolutely raves about these, so I decided to give them a shot! It's..... ok. Not my favorite. It didn't do anything bad to my skin, but nothing stellar either. I loved the way they felt, super relaxing gel that makes you feel like your in a spa with cucumbers on your eyes. I have dry skin, but not overly dry. But after the 15 minutes, I took it off and my skin IMMEDIATELY dried, I could almost feel the moisture flying off my face! I still had to moisturize after, which I usually do, but usually I have a lot more serum left on and feel super plump. I feel like this would be a good mask for normal/oily skin as a serum mask, to treat/add something to your routine, and moisturize after.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I use Drunk Elephant Baby Facial without issue. I use their retinol with almost no transition period (like two dry patches for a day).

I put a ton of this lotion on the areas and within two days there were over double of pimples all in that area. My face is also itchy, and becoming red.

I even get huge blackheads on my cheeks from this which I don't typically have blackheads on my cheeks. Unfortunately I just can't use it anymore.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I was very excited about the ingredients and price, but this product made my skin burn every time. My skin is not extremely dry or broken, but i do have sensitive skin.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love this sheet mask! I apply after washing and toning, then follow it with a moisturizer and it makes my skin so soft and hydrated. The essence from the mask is also easy to massage into your skin and doesn't get everywhere",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I currently have it on while writing the review. Im noticing a cooling feeling which burns stings a little... i usually dont buy otc products. But i needed something deaperately My first inital thought! Packaging could be better.. for the ladies having problem putting this on, you want lip and eye flaps facing outwards, the textured part of the mask on your skin. U just slide your finger across to make it stick!! The mask get tacky as the produxt absorbs into your skin",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Stung my eyes and burned my skin.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Excellent day and night cream,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Maybe it's my picky/sensitive skin type, but it broke me out with acne. It feels amazing, very refreshing and moisturizing; unfortunately it made my face red and clogged my pores after a week. Good luck to anyone who tries this. Btw- my skin is weird. Dry after I wash it (every soap I've tried, highend-drugstore), and mildly oily after a long day.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Okay I never ever leave reviews because I'm very lazy lol but I had to leave one for this, I've been using this after I use the cleanser everyday and I must say my skin is like extra plump and squishy (in a good way) it's made my face super smooth. I have very sensitive skin like to the point where I get shots every Tuesday for it, and this didn't break me out and it's just amazing I wish it was a tiny bit cheaper tbh though",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,It was just okay. It didn't really do anything good for my skin but also didn't do anything bad. I would of liked it if the packaging was better. Once you open it everything slides off including the white film. Because of that I didn't know what was the part that goes on your face . Then it's split in two. So the top part was stuck to the bottom. I understand the concept of why they split the mask. But maybe out a divider in the packaging. Like the tonymoly strawberry nose strips. Or even just made it a full mask. It was it's to much of a hassle to put on. Then it had the mouth and eye flaps. Those where awkward as well and made it even more difficult to put on. I don't think I'll buy this again. I'll try the over night gel mask instead. It was just to much of a hassle to put on,5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"A friend recommended me this moisturizer 2 years ago, time passed by and never bought it, she gave it to me for Christmas and I absolutely love it! It leaves the skin soft (like baby skin) and gives you the energy boost for a good looking face! I think it's a very good mostiourizer and affordable. But everyone has different types of skin so I recommend to ask a specialist before buying it, mine is normal kind of oily sometimes and fitted pretty well!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have SUPER sensitive skin and was hesitant about trying this product but kept hearing great things about it!

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This moisturizes my dry spots right away and absorbs quickly into the skin. It has never made me break out, and I have naturally oily skin",4,,

I've trusted them to be good, safe products since they market themselves as such. I didn't know as much about ingredients at the time and didn't think to look (my fault) as I have always trusted neutrogena. But I'm using this on my arms to get worth out of it because I can't stand the smell and I don't want to use fragrance and dyes on my face, especially in my skincare. They are only there for aesthetic and I think the jar is good enough (I love the jar design). Why do we need to dye something to convince people it feels like water?

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I absolutely love this product and will NEVER use anything else!!!

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"The best spf face lotion I've ever used. Never oily, have never gotten a sunburn while using it, and have also never broken out",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"i finally got this after running out of my old moisturizer (clinique moisture surge) and i have to say i like it a lot more. i have combination skin that tends towards oily and i find that products with hyaluronic acid really help. this product keeps my skin moisturized without making it greasy. it also does a nice job of sinking into the skin and not leaving it sticky like the clinique did. this does have frangrance in it, which i'm not crazy about, but i haven't noticed any ill effects yet, and i actually quite like the scent. it's very fresh and clean.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I LOVE this stuff! I use it twice a day, every day. It has become such a staple product in my routine, and I have noticed a dramatic difference in my skin. My skin is love elastic and smooth. My lines are less visible and my redness has decreased.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have been using this water gel for over a year now and have noticed results from the very first day I used it. It makes your skin plump, soft, and a healthy look to it. 10 out of 10 recommend this for even oily skin it's a miracle I have found a moisturizer that works for all skin types!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I tried it but I had know idea which side was the correct way! Didn't see much happening. It reminded me a lot of the gel face moisturizer they sell. I will try it again since I bought a couple and I'll update this review!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Best face mask. If your skin can get super dry like mine, this is for you. I am always hesitant to try drug store brands but this is amazing. I usually would drop alot of money at ""the other store"" for a product like this. It helped my skin while I was home visiting in Ohio in the winter. This mask makes me face feel so soft right after I use it. For the price you cant go wrong.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Like it!,1,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This project dried my face around my t zone and month area,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have combination skin. This will not moisturize a lot. I think this would be perfect for people with only oily skin. If you have dry skin you will still feel dry after applying it. Feels good when you first apply it though.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"i received this product in a sample bag and tried it out when the weather turned colder. So far, it has been excellent for my sensitive combination skin and I just purchased the full size product because I enjoyed it so much. A little goes a long way and my skin feels hydrated without the greasiness or breakouts. Even my brow expert at Ulta's Benefit Brow Bar noticed the difference in my skin during my last brow wax! The only thing (and it's a nitpicky thing at that) is that I wish I was packaged in a bottle versus a pot because I feel it would help me control how much I use and prevent wasting product. Otherwise I love it and will plan to repurchase!",3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Really like this product! My teenagers even get into it! U used Chanel hydra for several winters but gave this product a shot two years ago. Hooked!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have tried multiple sheet masks but this has to top all the ones I have tried before, my skin is dry and this mask leaves my skin glowing after use!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This feels great going on and my breakout prone kids with oily dehydrated skin love it. Hyaluronic based moisturizers are hit or miss for me. Some cause break outs and some dont. Unfortunately this one caused a new breakout every time I wore it. I've found a similar type of moisturizer from FAB that works well but is unfortunately more expensive.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,After days of using my skin broke out. Will not recommend to any one.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I loved this mask. It smelled clean and felt good on the skin. Only thing is the te and mouth holes are not cut out all the way. They have like a flap. Which is okay because if you want to take a small nap while it's working you can hydrate your lips and mouth, but what if I wanna eat popcorn and watch TV? They're just hanging there.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,So I love this moisturizer because it's a dupe for Beliefs Aqua bomb. It has the same feelings and cooling sensation. It makes you look hydrated and doesn't leave a sticky feeling when it absorbs. Doesn't break me out. I have dry normal skin and my nose tends to peel after a hot shower. So I apply this and it feels awesome.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I use it right after I wash my face. At night I put it on and let it absorb but if needed will apply a heavier night cream.,4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,It feels light on your face. Does not feel or look greasy.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I bought this same product but from target. This is amazing in the summer if you have oily skin. It's not greasy at all. By far, this is my favorite moisturizer",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,works well and smells amazing!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have an oily Tzone and this works for me. It dries quickly for the girl getting ready in a hurry in the morning. I love it.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I really wanted to like this mask. I have heard good things about this mask so I bought one to try. However, I simply couldn't get past it not staying securely on my face for even 2 seconds so I threw it away.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This caused really bad breakouts for me from small bumps to cystic acne. Will be returning.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I just love this product.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Nice product. I goes on nicely and smells amazing. I'll be buying it again.,2,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,apply after face washing and before applying makeup,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,You need this,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I love this type of mask. I have acne prone skin that gets very dry during the winter. This definitely helps without causing extra breakouts. It can be messy when you open the package from the liquid on the mask.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I would just use one pump of this on my face every day and I just kept noticing my face getting more oily. I saw no beneficial effects after using it for almost 5 weeks.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This stuff is... AMAZING!! I recently had a bad skin reaction to a mask I did so my face was SO dry. I'm talking like patches of dry flaky skin. I applied this 3 times a day for two days and the dryness was gone. A little goes a long way with this product which I enjoy. Highly recommend and will be buying again!,2,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have added this to my everyday routine. I love it I think it's a dupe for the H20+ Oasis Hydrating moisturizer. I love the Hydro Boost Line sm.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"My husband's dermatologist recommended this product. He tried it and loves it. Now it's all he will use. I always keep an extra on hand since he goes through it so quickly. Thats the thing, the gel is so light that it absorbs very quickly and you use more of it. Overall, I would recommend this product.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I generally have oily skin but its more combination in the winter months. The daily moisturizer that I use works so well at minimizes oil that it leaves dry patches around my chin and forehead during the winter months so I supplement it with this moisturizer at night and it works great for me. It does take more than a few minutes to absorbs but it does make your skin feel super moisturized. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone with oily skin for summertime though.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have now used this twice & I LOVE it. I'm a big fan of the Hydro Boost line. I have the moisturizer, the eye moisturizer & the fragrance free lotion. I love em all.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"The only thing I don't like is the container. I hate cosmetics that come in these pots. It is difficult to get all of the product out. If you have nails and are sticking you fingers in to get the moisturizer out, some of it always ends up under your fingernails. Pot is also heavy for travel. Container looks great, but not convenient at all to use.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I don't write reviews, but MY GOD this stuff is amazing! It's literally like heaven in a jar for my skin. I have combo skin, oily in my t-zone and normal on the perimeter. This instantly hydrates my skin without the greasy feeling. The best way to describe it is almost like putting water on your face and letting it soak in. Can't find any other moisturizer to replace it! My absolute FAVE!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Love this moisturizer! Curology recommended it so I decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. So light weight and it feels like heaven when you put it on. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate it at all. My face feels hydrated all day after using this. Definitely recommend!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Great product for daily use in the winter months for moisture.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I bought this because I heard such amazing things about it. I had to stop using this because of a burning sensation and irritation of my skin. I can not recommend this product! Buyer beware.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Those with sensitive skin should stay away from this product. I have sensitive skin and it is always difficult to find something that won't irritate my face. I really wanted to like this, but my skin broke out very quickly after use. I don't usually have terrible break outs but this caused really painful cystic acne. Disappointing.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"My face gets very dry this time of year, I use this twice a week and my face is so hydrated.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Usually get the H2O+ moisturizer but was wanting to try cheaper the results are very similar but the smell is pretty strong..,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Was finally getting my skin under control (extremely sensitive/acne prone) and I decided to get this moisturizer to complete my regimen. After a week of use, it completely reversed the condition of my skin, caused redness, itchiness, and even nodular acne. The product does not feel right when applying and feels plain gross when it sets. Do not recommenced",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I absolutely love this moisturizer,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I actually don't mind the smell and I am a big smell person. I thought it worked great for my dry skin, especially for this time of year. I do think it's a bit slippery, although it does stay on your face once you get it on. And I wish it came in 1 piece instead of 2. I also think the flaps for the eyes and mouth holes are kind of a waste. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this product! I have a slightly oily t-zone and really dry skin in the winter around my mouth and chin. It helped clear it up! Would buy again.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love this product! I was buying and trying all sorts of expensive brand products(for hydrating my skin), none of them were working for me! I have combination dry skin and I also have really bad year round allergies. The winds dry my skin out really bad. I use this day/night before my serum and moisturizer. It really hydrates my skin without making me look oily.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I love this light oil free moisturizer. I have pretty oily skin but have dry spots as well. I use prescription retinol at night so I have to be careful not to use anything with oil in it which will cause skin irritation. I use the moisturizer and wait about 10-15 minutes before applying the retinol. It's perfect. No irritation and I get the hydration my skin needs especially when using the retinol. I feel as if this has actually helped with the oil production. Great product!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have acne prone, sensitive skin that is not really dry or oily. I use a very gentle cleanser like Cetaphil or Cerave and then I like ro use an oil free moisturizer. I have been trying many different kinds and found this hydro gel on sell and decided to gine it a try. So glad I did! There is a slight pleasant smell at first but it goes away quickly, which I like. It gives my skin just the right amount of moisture with no residue or breakouts at all. My skin feels so soft and comfortable. I just love it. Finally found something that works for me.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I've used many different moisturizers and none have worked quite like this one. My boyfriend and I both use it daily - it absorbs extremely quickly and leaves our skin silky smooth. I apply it every morning after my shower and before makeup. My skin has gotten drier as I've shifted into my late 20's and it's really the only moisturizer I've used that immediately gets rid of that dry/flaky feeling and never makes me break out (which is an issue I've dealt with in the past)! LOVE it. Definitely give it a try!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This is a repurchase for me; I love this line of products! The hydro boost water gel is light weight, applies well and offers great hydration. I began using the hydro boost gel about a month ago, no, I did not run out of my first jar but I don't want to run out and not have a spare. Since using, I've noticed my under eye area is not as dry and the rest of my face is well moisturized with less texture! I use hydro bossy gel in the morning and at night.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I wanted to like this product, it moisturized nicely and absorbed nicely into my skin...it seemed to last a long time...however it had a really strong detergent-like smell to it and it caused a reaction in my skin...little red bumps everywhere...not acne but hard bumps...they haven't gone away yet!! Do not recommend if you have sensitive skin unfortunately.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I buy two every week to add to my weekly facial routine. The formula is deep penetrating and works even better with the cream mask from the hydro boost line.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"A couple months ago, I had the worst breakout of my life, no exaggeration. Cysts, zits, scarring, dry, flaky skin. All of it. I knew my moisturizer was making me break out this way, but I kept using because my skin is so ridiculously dry. Out of desperation, I bought this gel on a whim, and it WORKED. My skin is dry enough that I sometimes need a second or third application, but it never ever makes me break out or feel greasy. Skin as soft as anything and calms my overheating and redness. Even though its a little out of my price range, I'm investing in this again. Really really worth it. Only complaint is the ""smaller on the inside"" concept. I ran out of this stuff pretty quickly. Wish you got more.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This is a very vert thin moisturizer, I did not find it all that hydrating personally. I am going to use it up and not repurchase again.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have been using this product for about 6 months. I use it in the mornings, before I apply my makeup.

Now that I am a couple weeks in, I am going to buy the serum. I am so thankful to have found and tried these products. BTW, I bought the mask and tried it this weekend - so soothing.",5,,

Now that I am a couple weeks in, I am going to buy the serum. I am so thankful to have found and tried these products. BTW, I bought the mask and tried it this weekend - so soothing.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have oily skin and this is the best moisturizer ice tried on my skin,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have tried so many sheet masks and this is by far my favorite. I love the jelly consistency, so it doesn't fall off your face, super cooking and moisturizing without leaving a weird film on my face. Absolutely love for any da!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Love this product I use it everyday and this is my 4th bottle,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"My face tends to get oily through out the day but sometimes I'll have those days where I'm just DRY. This has really worked well for my skin the past couple of weeks and esp for the winter months, it's been super hydrating without making my face slough with oil during the day. Highly recommend!! Also the gel aspect of this moisturizer is soooo refreshing when you put it on!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love this mask, I have bought it several times and I like to use it once a week. The mask leaves the skin extremely hydrated!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Love it,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,My face looks bright and I notice a reduction in the appearance of my wrinkles right after using. I usually try to do 2 per week to keep results.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I love how fast my skin absorbs this gel formula. It doesn't have a strong smell and a little goes a long way. Really good product.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Though the serum inside the bag is watery, after using it for over 20min, my face feels soft and hydrated! Love this!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I was hesitant about this moisturizer because I have combo skin but it works well! Gives me the moisture I need without making my face oily through out the day!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I use this every evening after cleansing. Honestly, I have found that it works well before or after my nightly serum. I have very sensitive skin and was concerned about allergies, but did totally fine with this. It has balanced my combo skin and added wonderful softness. My skin drinks it in without a heavy, oily feeling.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This is an amazing product which I have been loving lately. It goes on my skin smooth after shower and it keeps my face hydrated... I can see that my face is a little bit more healthy looking! Overall a great product for the affordabale price!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,left my skin very moisturized and healthy looking! 10/10,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"After cleansing my face mornings and nights, I like to moisturize with this gel and it's great! It goes on smoothly and it feels really nice. It smells good, it's cool, light, and it absorbs rather quickly. I have very dry skin and this has helped me along with using my rosehip oil.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I've been using this product for over a year now and have loved it, although I've noticed that it has started to burn whenever I put it on after washing my face and using it after my toner and serum (which is what I've always done.) this could very well be due to my personal skin type changing, but it is heartbreaking due to the fact that it is one of my favorite moisturizers. The burning stops after it absorbs in, but has anyone else had an experience like this? Did Neutrogena possibly change the formula?",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I tried this mask because I have dry skin and I use the hydro boost cleanser, and I HATED IT!!!! 1. Made me breakout, 2. Bad smell, and 3. WAY TO SLIPPERY!!! DEFINITELY would NOT recommend",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"My skin seems to like this one better than the jar versions. I think it's because this has glycerin as a top ingredient, instead of the dimethicone that is in the jar versions. Overall, my skin feels more moisturized and hydrated with this line!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have combination skin and I do a modify 10 step k-beauty. I love these masks and use them for my night time routine.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I use this as my daily moisturizer under my makeup. It works well but I will probably go back to the Olay daily moisturizer as it's more cost efficient and they seem to do the same thing. This smells like sunscreen.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I used it immediately after cleansing my skin and it worked perfectly. I would recommend using a toner right before applying it but it isnt completely necessary.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This mask is easy to use and left my ""life-experienced"",sensitive skin feeling hydrated.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Since noticing the dryness of my under eye, I went on a rampage purchasing products for hydration. I've spent roughly $500 on other high end products that don't provide the hydration that Neutrogena Hydro boost does! People! Stop wasting your money and try this product, your skin will thank you!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"if you have oily skin this is for you! laura lee recommended in a video that lotion moisturizers tend to break oily skin out. so naturally, i tried this and i am blown away! worth every cent!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I brought this because I read some good reviews and asked the lady at the store. This gel feels great went on smooth...but it did not hydrate or moisturize my skin. Minutes later i could see dry patches on my face.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,oh my god. this product is so honestly amazing. i was a bit skeptical about it at first because some reviews said it made them break out and it smelled strong like a man's musk but it really really doesn't. it smells fresh and clean but it's not overpowering. this gives my skin the extra (hydro) boost that it needs to look refreshed and does NOT leave me oily. i have combo skin and it just evens everything out and paired with the Tatcha Silk Canvas... makes a perfect pair for skin care. love love love.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Started getting into this mask once Jackie Ania did her face routine one day. Loved it ever since, I probably use it 1/2 times out of the week nice way to unwind and pamper my face. The price is just starting to go up .-. I dont think it should be more than $2",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Laura Lee did a review of this product and I decided to check it out and I'm sure glad I did. I was super skeptical about it because I'm used to using Clinique Moisture Surge. This hydrates my skin and absorbs quickly without leaving behind any residue. I ‚ù§Ô∏è using this after a mask. This product doesn't last long for me but it's not too expensive compared with similar products with similar ingredients.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This product glides on smoothly and does NOT feel greasy or heavy. Feels like a light splash of water. LOVE THIS!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,strong fragrance but it feels so cooling and nice!!! My skin has been super dry due to all my acne creams and this helped a lot. Would buy again.,1,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"it doesn't last long, I had to constantly reapply it when I used to use this product.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love this stuff! It is reasonably priced, and I noticed a big difference within three days, or so.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I used to love this product when I didn't have acne in the summer but once I moved south my skin got way more oily and way more acne prone. The gel started to look weird on my skin and my mom noticed a difference in how my skin looked when I stopped using it. When my skin clears up I might go back to this but overall it just wasnt a good product for acne,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I was put on this product as part of a skin care regime for some issues I was having. It is AMAZING! The way it plumps up my skin and smooths it out - I swear it makes me look 10 years younger every time I use it. It absorbs right into my skin and makes it feel so good. I will never go back to a moisturizer!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love this moisturizer. I am in my late 20's and have combination (oily and dry) skin. I had been looking for a product that balanced my skin and has anti-aging properties. This is perfect! No more shine on my face from other moisturizers. This product is soothing, feels great, goes on easily, and lasts all day. I highly recommend it.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This is honestly the best moisturizer I've ever tried. It's so hydrating and slick, but it's not oily or thick or anything like that. It leaves my skin looking absolutely beautiful every time I use it. I've used this moisturizer regularly for the past year and a half and I've definitely noticed a difference in my skin. My skin is brighter, glowy, smoother, and I've even noticed my acne isn't as bad since throwing this in my daily regimen. This product is honestly my holy grail!!!!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I use it every day,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I purchased this moisturizer recently after the Aveeno one I was using was discontinued. I had used the fragrance and dye free version of this when this line first came out. I liked it but needed something a little more hydrating in winter. This batch (with the fragrance and dye) has such a strong, masculine scent that I don't think I will purchase it again. I don't know why skincare (facial especially) is fragranced at all. The smell is just so strong and not a good choice for sensitive skin. I also don't understand why there is so much packaging for this. The container is huge for a small amount of cream, and then it comes in a huge box! Unless they bring back the fragrance free version again I will be skipping this the next time I need to buy a moisturizer.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love the hydro gel line SO much, the moisturizer and face wash is amazing, not only can you instantly feel a difference in the softness of your skin, but they all smell so good! But, this product was definitely the flop of the line in my opinion. If you are acne prone, I wouldn't recommend this product at all. My entire face broke out through our the first day of wearing this ( the other products that I've tried from this line haven't had the same results at all ) I wanted to love it, and I hate that I don't, but I definitely would pass if you're looking for a good sun screen that doesn't clog your pores.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I started using this moisturizer a month ago and I absolutely love it. This moisturizer absorbs into the skin quickly, doesn't make my skin oily, and also hydrates the areas of my skin that are dry. Before using this moisturizer I felt that my makeup always looked flaky and oily at the same time and I thought it was the makeup I was using. After using this moisturizer, my makeup looks smooth and I haven't experienced any of the strange flaky/oily phenomena. The only reason I took away a star on this review is because the product doesn't last very long. I've only had mine for a little over a month and it's almost empty.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This product was a huge surprise. Normally I use higher end hydrogel like from Boscia. I also use Pacifica sheet mask on my dry acne prone skin.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I used to use Clinique 3 step, but it started making me much more oily than I already am.

I've tried so many different face washes and lotions, this is by far my favorite!",2,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Not recommended for sensitive skin!! This made my skin burn so bad and I never have acne but this completely broke out my skin. Don't apply before makeup it will make it slippery,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I tried this mask for the first time last night, and I woke up this morning to hydrated, but tight skin. I like the tightning effect! I think I'll explore more Hydro Boost products now. This mask may have to be added to my weekly routine!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have bought three pots of this product and am still happy with it. I have combo skin that's on the dry side in the winter and a little oilier in the summer, and this works for both. It's never broken me out like most do, but when you really want some extra hydration I would consider an eye cream or night cream because this will provide only a daily light hydration. I use it over my Derma E vitamin C serum and under concealer alone, and I think it really gives that nice glow without getting really greasy.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Makes my skin so much softer,1,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"At first, I really enjoyed this moisturizer. It smells good and sinks in the skin quickly. I used it for two days and my skin texture changed. I noticed several small bumps on day 1. I chose to ignore it and keep using the product. The next day I woke up with cystic acne. Once I stopped using the product my skin cleared up in a few days. If you do not have sensitive skin you will probably enjoy this, it just was not for me.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have normal to dry skin and felt like my regular moisturizer just wasn't doing enough. My mom suggested this and she was right! I use VERY LITTLE under my moisturizer and it really helps keep those dry patches hydrated throughout the day. Doesn't look greasy at all.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have very oily skin and have been looking for a moisturizer that would keep my skin hydrated without enhancing the oils in my skin. The moisturizer I was using before this one did just that and was on the pricier side. I bought this after hearing such great reviews thinking it would be perfect for my skin while being more affordable. Unfortunately after a couple of weeks I noticed my skin was beginning to feel very tight and dry patches started to appear on my cheeks. I have since stopped using this product and gone back to my old moisturizer and doing this alone has brought my skin back to life. I think I would prefer being a tad bit oily than have random dry patches on my skin. It is disappointing since I had really high hopes for this product.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I bought this after not wanting to spend too much on my last moisturizer. I was previously using Clinique Moisture Surge. I use this twice a day, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and supple! I have combination skin, and this moisturizer doesn't leave me feeling oily or sticky!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Okay, so this mask actually stays on unlike other masks. It's so soothing and makes me feel moisturized",1,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"It works well, I have dry skin and it keeps my skin hydrated but I personally wanted something that looked a little more glowy whereas this is matte and makes my B.B. cream look matte on top.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have very oily skin and this has help improved that. It moisturizes skin and doesn't feel sticky or greasy. Absorbs fast. Have been using this for years and will continue to use it.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Best moisturize ever,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I was using murad but this brand works just as well and half the price,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This Moisturizer is AMAZING. I have tried so many different once but, this one is the BEST so far. It doesn't feel grecy at all. I am definitely going to buy it again.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I use after washing my face,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"While I don't wear makeup anymore, I have paid a lot for face products to increase moisture and elasticity, this is the first one that actually did this. I wear an oxygen mask at night, in the past 4 years, I have had a dent across my cheek every day. When I first took this home I put a little on just to see how it felt, because I hate greasy. The next day I woke up in the morning with no mark, and every day since!! I hope to purchase this product for the rest of my days.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have very tricky skin, and this moisturizer was a solid win for me. My skin is oily and acne-prone, and breaks out from almost anything. I was previously using Cerave's morning and night time moisturizers, but they made me greasy and didn't hydrate my skin. This product, however, is seemingly perfect for me. It hydrates, absorbs quickly, and doesn't break me out. Not to mention, it smells amazing!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"The gel mask is too slippery, the fragrance burns the eyes, added synthetic color, and the essence is so watery it makes a mess from right when you open it to when you apply it. It's an okay mask just for the cooling effect but other than that no hydration whats so ever. Want a sheet mask? Get one from an actual K Beauty brand (Skinfood Gel Masks are to die for).",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Such a cooling and refreshing moisturizer!! Perfect for my combo skin, not greasy at all! Absolutely love it so far üòç",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,My skin is very dry. I like this product so far because it seems to be moisturizing without leaving a greasy layer on my skin,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Fragrance usually isn't a problem for me, but with this product, I think it was just too much. It's a fine moisturizer - light, non-greasy, although it didn't seem to last very long and it took a while to absorb - but if you have sensitive skin, I recommend steering clear, especially if you're sensitive to fragrance. It has a very strong scent and left a slight burning sensation when first applied. A shame, because I really wanted to like this one! For something similar that didn't give my skin any issues, try Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+. Much more sensitive skin-friendly.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"i have very oily skin and when i use this it keeps me matte for most of the day, but it makes my skin feel a little tight and leaves some dry patches. In those areas i will just put more product on",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I use it everyday. My skin absorbs it immediately, it feels lite on the skin.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Use every time I wash my face,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"When used alone I really like this moisturizer! It melts into the skin nicely. But when I use my Coola SPF 30 Face Sunscreen on top of it, it pills up and feels gross on the skin. Do not recommend with spf over top.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This is probably the best mask I've ever bought. It left my skin feeling super hydrated and paired with the Neutrogena Hydro-Boost gel cream, my skin feels like a pillow. I definitely recommend buying these. And the good thing is they're very affordable, so you can stock up.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I needed a new moisturizer that was non comedegenic and this is perfect! It melts right into my skin and makes my skin look fresh without being greasy,4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"So... I saw info about this mask from a YouTube make-up/ skin care guru. The first time I tried this (yes it messy) I had instantaneous moisture. I have very dry sensitive skin, am prone to make-up/ product breakouts - however, THIS, the day after, my skin was super glowing and very moisturized. So I went and bought 10 more - a now staple in my skin care twice a week routine.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Love this product !!!! I've used several similar moisturizers like this one, (Clean and Clear and Tarte) but this one takes the cake !!!!!!!! It feels so light! Smells great!! It's an almost instant change. I noticed a difference in my skin within one use. I will 100% be buying this again!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I use this in the summer to moisturize my face before makeup. Goes on smooth and not greasy at all on my oily combo skin. Wish the SPF was a little more but my makeup has SPF too. Great for everyday.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Clogs pores! Way to heavy.,4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,These are incredible if you are looking for a quick pick me up for your skin. Hyaluronic acid is a very gentle acid that attracts water molecules. It's the perfect ingredient for moisture. I have very sensitive skin and I'm be had no problems with these masks. They're easy to apply since it's in 2 pieces and they hold a lot of product. I have repurchased numerous times and will continue to do so,4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Love this!,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I've been using this for over a year now and I won't go back to anything else. My skin soaks it right up and doesn't leave a greasy residue. I have used both regular and extra dry formulas and I prefer the regular so I don't get super oily. I use it both morning and night. Give it a try!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I've been using this for almost a week after I quit another moisturizer that made me break out, and so far it's been my holy grail. Feels amazing when applied and it stays throughout the day. My face is naturally oily and I feel like I always have to dab throughout the day, but with this I don't.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"The mask is in two halves which i appreciate, it stays on fine but i was laying down. The packaging is pretty, it's kinda rainbowy. It hydrated my face to some effect, but my insanely dry nose is still somewhat dry. Everywhere else on my face does feel quenched though. My cheeks feel deeply hydrated, but they're the only place. My cheeks also feel very supple. It's less papery than an ordinary sheet mask. It contoured to my skin well. It felt gentle on my skin, but towards the end of the 15 minutes it felt a bit itchy.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I use this every night before bed. It goes on smooth and easy. It hydrates well and it has such a light clean smell. It makes my face feel so soft and replenished. It seems to work really well under makeup too. I hope they can make something similar with SPF in it in the future. I love this product!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Was so excited to use this because I've been using Neutrogena for years and years. But after a few days, my skin started to get red and break out around my chin. At first, I didn't know why but, as a precautionary measure, I stopped all my skincare for a couple days. My zits went away and no new ones formed. I used my other products without this gel, and no breakouts happened. Let's say, i wasn't happy.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This product does exactly what it does. It hydrates well but it some extra dry area I have to add more,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"When I first began using the hydro-boost gel, I used the one in the jar. The pump is more hygienic and this version has spf! I've noticed it makes a difference in my skin in the cold winter months and the harsh summer. I walk to and from the train station to get to work each day and this gel has been great against the elements and does not cause me to break out. My only complaint is that I need to wear makeup over it because it makes my skin appear shiny. The gel without the spf does not have this effect on my skin. I have combination skin that tends to get oily.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Love this for my oily skin, absorbs quickly and feels so replenishing!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I've tried this product a while back but I opt out for Garnier version of hydra boost only because this product isn't long lasting. I have a combination skin type with oily T zone and normal around other areas. Towards the end of the day I can feel my cheeks getting little tight. There are days where after I applied it for 20mins I can feel my skin little dry. I wouldn't use during winter.,4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"My skin is loving this quenching product. It took a bit for it to get my skin more supple but it is doing the trick. Leaves my skin so soft too. A little goes a long way as well. I like the size of this. Usually these types of products are small, almost mini & the fact that this isn't is a plus to me.",5,,

Overwhelming laundry detergent scent that lingers long after the application. Also, why do companies add fragrances and dyes to their products? They serve no beneficial purpose. I had high hopes for this product as I was looking for an oil-free moisturizer for my acne-prone skin. Sadly this is not it. If you look carefully at the ingredients list, the product is full of silicones which will ""sit"" on top of your skin. That's what gives your skin the illusion of suppleness and hydration, not the hyaluronic acid, which is very low on the list. Also, highly irritating ingredients in this. I had rubbed one of my eyes which proceeded to cause horrible irritation and sensitivity even with washing hands after applying the gel. If your skin tolerates anything, I can see this being used as a somewhat decent primer. Otherwise, look elsewhere for a skin-friendly moisturizer that actually does the job.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I bought this product thinking it will help with my dry skin. I used it for 1.5 weeks, twice daily.

Then after a few days the corner of my mouth started to get really dry and peeling. Then a few days afterward I started breaking out which I rarely do. I went back and read the review and saw similar reviews. I'm going to stop using this product and go find a different product.

I loved it even more when I was pregnant and was using a cheaper, different product. I wasn't working and thought I would save money and not have to buy this...wrong. It's worth getting. The other product dried my skin out and left dry patches all over my face. I went back to my water gel and it cleared up in just a couple days. This product is on my ""stock pile"" list.",1,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I was looking for a moisturizer that is great for dry skin but also water based because I use a water based foundation. Any moisturizers meant for super dry skin are not water based but since I use a water based foundation I needed a moistuzier that wouldn't cause any chemical conflict but still help my super dry skin. This did the trick.,4.4,,

The two pieces do not bother me, but the mask is so frustrating to put on! I've had other gel mask that have not given me as many problems as this one has. It kept rolling off my face, even if I slightly tilted my head from a completely flat position to see what my phone was buzzing about or to get more comfortable. Be prepared to do absolutely nothing with this mask on, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, however is not fun when you're always doing something like me.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This is the best gel formula I've used. I have dry and sensitive skin, so usually most products irritate it and do nothing to help my dry patches around my nose. One application of this, completely rid me of my dry patches and most of my redness. I've been wearing it for 5 hours and my skin is still feeling hydrated. I wanted to wait before reviewing because it is very new to me, but I couldn't wait since it has been so amazing. There is no strong scent, it didn't irritate my skin, it smoothed out dry patches that have been on my face for months, and it has a great cooling effect. I finally found my holy grail water gel and plan on trying more of the Hydro boost line. Highly suggest for people with dry skin!!!",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have combination skin with my T-zone being on the dry side and only the occasional small pimple. I thought this would help with the winter time dryness since everyone was raving about it and while it did work wonders on the dryness, it caused me to develop cystic acne along my T-zone and by my ears! I used it for a few months, hoping my skin just needed to get used to the moisturizer but it kept getting worse. As soon as I quit using this product, I stopped getting cystic acne and my skin is finally clearing up again.",2,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,You guys... this moisturizer has been sent down by Jesus himself. This moisturizer feels so light and refreshing and not sticky at all!

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I absolutely love this moisturizer. I would say this is a perfect dupe for Tarte drink of h2o. It is not harsh on my skin at all.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love love love this product. I started a new venture in life and needed to have more moisture and less wrinkles and a friend told me to buy this product and man, this was the Best Buy for the money.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I loved this product. I was sceptical because the Hydro Boost Water Gel didn't hydrate me at all. I find myself having to buy very expensive mosterizers because regular drugstore ones never do the job. And even the expensive ones are only a slight better. I have went through many hydrating masks, always left unsatisfied until I found this holy grail product. I promise you won't regret buying this. I will give ur crackly, dry skin the moisture they are craving.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"As soon as I opened this I was reminded of being a child and wearing rock solid hair gel during gymnastics meets... it also reminds me of the blue liquid they use in porta potties. Even after applying to the face the smell doesn't go away. I bought this because it's cheaper than the prestige moisturizers I was using, but the price difference is not worth this smell. So disappointed.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I recently decided to start taking care of my skin, I know, super late to the party! I have dry skin and had not been taking care of my skin properly for years. I was recommended this product to help clear up my dry flakes and patchiness to get me on the right track. I have been using this for 2 weeks now and absolutley love it! The first two times I used it, it kind of stung a little but nothing too crazy, I decided to give it a week of twice daily use and i could not be happier that i stuck with this product. It feels great and unlike some, I enjoy the smell. My skin feels SO SMOOTH after applying and it super quickly absorbs. It feels like an ice cold glass of water for my face. I will say that it still tingles a very little for like 5 mins when applying, but I believe it is because of the hyaluronic acid that is doing its job. I combat this MINOR tingling by applying a few sprays of Mario Badescuon rose water.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,My new favorite mask! I love the 2-piece aspect and the plumpness my skin has after! They knocked it out of the park with this one.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I guess it's my fault for not checking the igredients before I bought it. There is no use for fragrance in face products and the fragrance with this one is strong and overpowering and therefore is NOT suitable for sensitive skin types. The product feels wonderful and refreshing and would be a 6/5 for me if they just left it unscented. Neutrogena... why...,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,First few days felt amazing after 2 weeks It started to tingle on my face and then one day my cheeks turned bright pink with bumps ! Never had that problem before so upset it didn't work out ....,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I love this moisturizer, you need the tiniest amount for your entire face! I love it! All my friends love it as well and they started using it too!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I wanted to purchase H2O products like I have in the past. Now you no longer sell it. So I am trying the Neutrogena.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I put this on in the morning and at night before I go to bed. Also after I get out of the shower or cleanse my face. It is an awesome product and moisturizes well, but it doesn't last very long and I always still have lots of dry/dead skin. Sometimes it is too greasy and makes my face too oily. However, it did improve my skin health and even helped with my acne some.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,i love this and will definitely buy again! super super hydrating and my skin feels amazing.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"It's the perfect moisturizer. Not greasy. Not heavy, which makes it perfect for prepping the skin before makeup. I love that the alcohol isn't one of the the main ingredients. I use this in the mornings and to prep before I put on makeup, only reason I don't use it before bed is because I prefer moisturizing with oils before bed. I personally like the fragrance.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I just bought this a few days ago, and I have to say...I found a new staple! I live in the mid-west, with cold winters and muggy summers. Spring time is here and I was looking for something non-greasy but moisturizing enough for my combo skin. This stuff is great, and smells great too (not overpowering though). I would compare this stuff to the True Cream Aquabomb by Belif, which I've bought before. This water gel is better, and cheaper! Definitely go with the gel if you are more combo/oily, and cream if you are more dry. The gel is perfect, feels refreshing and moisturizes pretty well throughout the day. I still use some face mists throughout the day, but this stuff is still great.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Wow, wow, wow. I bought this moisturizer for my 15-yr old sister as a b'day present. I was psyched myself because I was going to use it as well ;) . This moisturizes your skin so well.. When applying it, it's almost like a matte texture on your skin! But it doesn't make your skin look matte because it's light. It also smells wonderful! I just bought my 2nd container since I have ran out of the 1st already.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I would recommend this product to anyone.Great,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This moisturizer has changed my skin. I see a lot of people writing about how it broke them out; most new products you use are going to cause a skin purge. Once I got through that my skin is amazing. My ONLY complaint about it is my container started to disintegrate after having it about 2 months. The plastic around the cover all broke off and now it won't close properly. It's almost like the product broke down the plastic. It's very weird.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I use this every morning and night after I wash my face. I've only been using it for about a week and already notice a huge change! I have combo skin (oily t-zone/dry cheeks and forehead) and this stuff moistureizes my dry spots so well, and my oily spots without making me anymore oily! It absorbs right into my skin and just makes it feel so smooth, soft, and hydrated. I see a lot of people complaining about the smell, but I personally like it, it smells very fresh and clean. Will definitely keep using this!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,i loved this product so much. it is not greasy/tacky at all and i seen immediate results.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"As ""drugstore"" products go, this one is the best! I'm in my 50's and have tried many prestige and drugstore products for daily face moisture. I have completely fallen for this one, and my skin looks fantastic. I also live in the mountains at high elevation, and my skin stays hydrated with this product.",4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I use this product day and night and it just doesn't keep my dry skin moisturized. In fact, it doesn't moisturizer at all. I was so exited to purchase this product but it was such a disappointment. It also smells really bad.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I bought this because I was out of my Urban Decay moisturizer and wanted to save a couple bucks. I opened this up and my gosh the thing is so full of fragrance it nearly knocked me over. I had read the ingredient list and decided, ""It can't be that bad, can it?"" I was wrong. It just has the worst old lady perfume smell! I did try it once, just to test it out, and the smell does sort of go away after a while, but it's just not worth it. It also didn't really moisturize my face. It's like it disappeared on my face, leaving that horrible smell behind. If you're sensitive to scent, buy something else. I will be returning this and going back to the Urban Decay face gel.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I use this product every night after showing and cleaning my face and removing makeup. I feel so refreshed after using it, and even my boyfriend has used it, and has felt refreshed the next morning. This is one of the only products that makes me feel moisturized the next morning",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This has been my go-to moisturizer for awhile now. I am in my early thirties with combination skin that is sometimes sensitive. This product really sinks into my skin and feels great! It is not greasy at all. I will sometimes use this with the serum from the same line if I want extra moisture.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Really like this product.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I like the smell and how it feels when first applied. However, when it absorbs into the skin, my skin feels dry and as if I did not moisturize at all. I wanted to like this so badly because I have oily skin and I needed to try a water-based moisturizer. I will most likely never repurchase because I feel as though there has to be another water-based moisturizer that will feel more hydrating and replenishing!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I am really liking this but I'm still a little too dry after I put on a small amount so I'm applying it twice and it helps. I think my skin is just more dry than usual with the weather changing too frequently but I feel like I'll love it during summer. Might get the thicker one for the winter months next time.,4.4,,

I have combination skin and get really dry by my chin and cheeks and when I put this on I saw results the next day. It defiantly feels like you're putting water on and I get oily on my nose and forehead so I was nervous that this would make it worse, it doesn't! Before you know it it soaks into your skin and it makes it softer instantly. For the price, you can't go wrong with this!",3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I love this sheet mask! It doesn't break me out or upsets my super sensitive skin and it really hydrates it! I only use this once in a while when I feel like my skin needs a little extra help and the price is reasonable. Only thing I don't like about it is it comes in two parts- one sheet from the nose up and one sheet from nose down. I think it should just be one cohesive sheet and it's kinda annoying. Overall love it though and such a great product!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I was an avid user of Clinique Moisture Surge for years. The price point was a bit high, but I found it to be more effective and less greasy than traditional face lotions.

Only downside to it is i sometimes use another moisturizer on top of it or sometimes I use a heavier cream at night, just because I'm not sure how deep this is actually moisturizing.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This is perfect if you want a lightweight moisturizer that keeps your skin hydrated for hours on end.

I sometime will even use it before putting on my night cream if I feel I need a little extra hydration. If you like the clinique moisture surge gel, you will love this. Absolutely worth it for what you pay. I also have compared this to the Peter Thomas Roth hyaluronic acid water gel and this is not nearly as sticky and absorbs much quicker.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This was honestly so bad for my acne prone skin.

For starters this product is pretty expensive, but I purchased it anyways because I was in search of a moisturizer that was hydrating and had SPF in it. Upon my first application, my skin absorbed it quickly and it immediately dried out my skin. I had assumed I applied too little, so I reapplied more and felt the same results. Throughout the day my face did not get greasy, but it was in fact dry and lacked moisture. Needless to say, I will be returning this product, I'm pretty disappointed :-( Just an FYI I have sensitive, combination skin.",5,,

It does burn for about 30 seconds but then goes away. I have super sensitive skin and it's hard to find things that don't burn my skin.

Also my skin has been breaking out, and this mousiturizer is the only thing that has been different in my routine.

Being on Epiduo and other cystic acne medications my skin is horribly dry but also extremely sensitive. This mask has transformed my skin and left it baby soft, redness free and not irritated at all.

It feels like a thin sticky film on my skin after and it's not pleasant at all. To make matters worse, upon using the product it made my skin irritated, red, blotchy and plain embarrassing!

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"The product is great! It moisturizes my t-zone well, which is why I bought it. However, since I have combination the areas outside my t-zone are dry, especially now since it's getting colder. It doesn't moisturize some of my dry areas, including around my mouth and parts of my cheeks, well. I have to use a heavier cream to moisturize these parts. This isn't terrible, considering gels aren't meant for dry skin. However, for the price, it would have been nice if worked in my drier areas. Maybe this product will work well all over the face for people with oily skin, but combination and dry skin types should proceed with caution. I'm giving it four stars because the product worked well in summer, but not so much in colder temperatures.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I've waited to try this because I have so much skincare that it's overwhelming to introduce something new into my routine - I tend to waste a lot as it is. My skin type: skin tone, light to medium; fine lines, enlarged pores, combination/oily skin with dryness around my eyes (my entire orbital area) if I don't consume plenty of water and moisturize properly. I follow a strict beauty routine that includes different cleansers for morning and night. I double cleanse after I wear makeup and use specific serums and moisturizers in the morning and then use separate and different types of serums and moisturizers at night. My morning routine includes a stabalized Vitamin C Serum combined with a Serum to lock it in, followed with a light cream for my cheeks and nose; a cream for the rest of my face, an eye serum, then 2 heavier eye creams. My nighttime routine is similar only I use an AHA and BHA, then heavier serums and creams with pure sqaulane oil, then a heavier gel moisturizer to lock it all in. It works for me and keeps my skin balanced. I'm conscientious of all ingredients in Skincare and makeup. Although my skin has oily areas, I would rather be super moisturized than dry. I do what I can to prevent deep wrinkles. Because I have spent so much money on skincare products with rave reviews, I waited to buy this. I've been eyeballing it since it was introduced to the consumer. The list of ingredients would leave one to believe that this moisturizer would be great; however, it managed to break my face out, leave my face feeling like I had a something as heavy as Pond's cold cream on, yet made my face and neck peel ALL over. I had no smooth areas for over a week and that's been with me taking desperate measures. My skin has started to repair, but thanks to that whole buy one, get one 50% off (this should have been a red flag) I now have two jars of this cheap junk that I don't even want to give to anyone. Heads up! There's is better products for less $$.",5,,

After 2 uses it gave me cysts all across my forehead. I would not recommend this.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This product got great reviews, and I was looking for a daily moisturizer for my oily, acne-prone skin that wouldn't make me feel greasy, so I decided to try it out. The moisturizer is a really nice, smooth, gel texture and it does have a strong scent, which I really liked but I can definitely see it being a problem for those sensitive to scent. I didn't notice the smell lasting throughout the day though, only when I first opened the jar. The gel felt nice and cool on my skin, but I don't feel like it really absorbed into my skin or provided much moisture, just kinda sat on top. It is definitely non-greasy, but after a couple weeks of use, I had one of the worst breakouts of my life, and ultimately returned the product.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have dry, sensitive, and acne prone skin. I was on the hunt for a moisturizer that wouldn't break me out, and all the hype surrounding this product being great for all skin types definitely got me. I HATE THIS. It burns going on, and the smell lingers even after I've applied and set my makeup. It also caused numerous dry patches of actually flaking skin.

I put it on morning and night and it makes my skin soft, radiant, and hydrated. I have combination skin and it is perfect for me.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"i love the texture and smell of this water based gel. i have super oily skin, this helps keep it hydrated without any sticky residue. absorbs super quick and helps boost my moisture level. however i don't like the fact you have to stick your fingers into the tub, needs to have a press down applicator. but overall my entire family enjoys this moisturizer. we have purchased several times",3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I purchased this product to replace the costly UD rehab gel. When comparing the feel of the two products, they are comparable. When comparing the application of these two products, the UD is thinner on the skin and absorbs quicker...Hydro Boost has more of a glycerin feel when applying but does absorb nicely, they both leave your skin feeling soft and supple, and ready for makeup application. When comparing the scent of the two products, Hydro Boost does have a more dominate smell, but it's pleasant! I prefer the lightweight gel over traditional lotion moisturizers and I'm happy I gave them a try. I have oily skin with dry patches on either side of my nose/mouth, these gels help decrease the mid-day grease you get with traditional moisturizers! Please give a gel a try....either UD or Hyrdo Boost...you won't regret it. When reading other reviews, please keep in mind that everyone's skin reacts differently, and everyone takes care of their skin in different ways.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"It's a great product, but not really for dry skin. I have dry skin except for my nose which get quite oily. Whenever I apply the moisturizer on my face, it doesn't moisturize well besides my nose because it's oily. The rest of my face still feels a little dry, like I want to apply another moisturizer. Another thing is that I feel like the product itself in the container doesn't last long. Ive been using it for about 2 weeks and I feel like I'm running out already even though I only dip my finger in twice. Other than those 2 cons, it smells great and feels super soft and it does hydrate very well on my nose. So if you have oily skin this is great for you since it's water based and not oil based.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Please keep this product available. I love it!,2,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"At first I thought that this was going to be more like a thick gel but it turned out to be a very nice and smooth gel. It absorbs very quickly for when you have dry skin and it does feel a bit heavy (kind of like make up) but not that bad. It does seem like you would half to pay a lot of money for a small container and that is true because the container is pretty small, but it REALLY does work.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have combination skin and this stuff rocks! Every other hydration product I've used just sits on my skin and makes my skin more oily especially in the t zone. This stuff absorbs so well!

It has sunscreen and especially in the summer, I don't want a heavy layer as I wear other products as well, including foundation most days. The fact that it's light but has hyaluronic acid is the clincher for me, as that is a recommended ingredient for pulling moisture to the skin. I would like to see a higher SPF but my foundations usually have sunscreen too, so it seems like enough.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Absorbs quickly but provides great moisture. Wonderful under makeup!,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I bought this to compare to my favorite Clinique moisture surge gel and it didn't compare. It didn't last long and had a burning sensation when I put it on my face. I returned it within a week.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,The price is great and works better than Visionaire which is $86.00 . Hydro gel is less than $20.00,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I bought this product because I was looking for a gel moisturizer that wouldn't leave a residue on my face, which apparently is a difficult task, but I fell in love with this instantly. I've never used a moisturizer like this one where it absorbs almost immediately into your skin and does not leave any weird residue or texture whatsoever. I do see a lot of complaints about the smell but I actually love it, it's very refreshing almost like a glorified very fresh baby powder smell. This moisturizer also helps my very oily skin build-up, when I wake up in the morning usually my face is extremely oily, but with this there's almost no oil and makes me skin extremely soft. I use this every day before makeup and after I take makeup off, best moisturizer in my opinion that I've found this far.",2,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This makes my skin look so amazing, it absorbs super quickly. But I used it for about 2 week and then I got dry patches all over my face. I went back to my regular moisturizer and everything cleared up. Went back to this for a day and dry patches came up again. I have usually have combo skin.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I got this product a few weeks ago and I am OBSESSED.

The Hydro Boost Water Gel absorbs so fast and feels so refreshing when I put it on. I love that there's no residue, and I swear this has helped my acne-prone skin. It has also helped reduce oiliness and I just can't recommend this product enough for others with oily skin!",5,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,This is probably the best moisturizer I've ever tried. I already used the first tub and it's amazing! I've tried other neutrogena moisturizers but nothing compares to this.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I live in a hot dry climate where some moisturizers come off too sticky and heavy during the summer months making my face appear greasy and shiny. This gel absorbs quickly without the greasy feel or look. It's a great price and comparable to Clinique's Moisture Surge.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This makes my skin look so amazing, it absorbs super quickly. But I used it for about 2 week and then I got dry patches all over my face. I went back to my regular moisturizer and everything cleared up. Went back to this for a day and dry patches came up again. I have usually have combo skin.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have skin issues. This does not interfere with the topical medication. I actually mix with it to lessen the irritation. I've NEVER finished a product...I usually have to throw it away as it just goes bad from sitting so long. I love this. I'm so glad I tried it!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I am on my 6th tub of this!!! I never used to moisturize because i couldn't find one that didn't make me feel suffocated or greasy.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I have searched forever for a moisturizer that doesn't make me break out but gets rid of dry patches.

I would say it's the equivalent to the top brand of gel moisturizer that's sold at elsewhere.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I thought that since this product says its a gel it would soak into the skin and feel very moisturizing.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have tried a lot of moisturizers, and this is nearly the perfect one for day. It feels light, soaks in immediately, feels incredibly hydrating, dries matte, and the effects last. The price point is even reasonable. The ONLY thing I don't like about this is the fragrance. It smells like unbrand hotel room body lotion, and it's strong. I really wish this were fragrance-free to make it literally the perfect moisturizer, but for the price I can deal. This honestly works better for me than Clinique's Moisture Surge did. I would highly recommend, just be aware that this does have a strong, unfortunate scent. If you don't mind dryer sheet smell, you'll love it.",5,,

Until recently I had been using harsh acne washes even though my acne hasn't been an issue since high school. It's been a cycle of the harsh chemicals, dry skin, and then my skin overcompensating by producing a lot of oil. I am so excited that this moisturizer literally gets sucked into my skin the second I put it on. It smells clean and fresh, not sure why some reviews say otherwise. It's a gel that is slightly watery, so you really need only a fingertip of it, it glides on smooth and you can tell this will last a long time.

I have severe acne and combo skin and this product makes my skin feel great. It's not itchy, it doesn't irritate. It actually soothes my angry, irritated skin. The smell of the product is terrible to be honest. Just really a horrible smell. BUT I'm still giving this product 5 stars because of how it makes my skin feel. And trust me, my skin is not easily pleased.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Once again Neutrogena puts way to much scent and not enough of what they need to. Being a big fan of gel lotions I was super excited to try this, but what a disappointment! Waaay to much scent and a powdery feel once applied to my face- this is not a gel. I applied twice a day and my face was just not happy with it. I have normal sensitive skin.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have very dry skin in some areas and oily in others. I breakout very easily, so I must use a prescription retinol nightly which dries out my skin. I have been searching for a good moisturizer that pairs well with my prescription creams. I wanted something I could use day and night. This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I bought it immediately and have been using it for a few weeks now. It has a cooling sensation once you apply it and absorbs quickly. Once absorbed, your skin is left feeling silky. The smell doesn't bother me nor do I feel it lingers. It does the job at moisturizing without breaking me out or making me more oily. I gave it 4 stars because I'm still on the search for a moisturizer because the skin around my mouth is still dry however I will continue to use this product.",4,,

I think the extra exfoliation from my weekly clay mask has revealed a damaging chemical in this moisturizer.

Though I have oily skin, I still want a moisturizer that makes my skin feel supple and soft, while at the same time does not exacerbate my oiliness. This product did exactly that! I loved it! It feels extremely light-weight on the skin and has a wonderful, slightly cooling sensation. I've used both at night and during the day. It also works fantastically under makeup. It soaks into the skin quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. As a bonus, it has a nice, clean smell to it and I like the packaging - it looks fancy.

Very oily t-zone and extremely dry under eyes (the rest is normal) so I have been struggling to find something very refreshing for my under eyes that will give them some moisture.

This product works so well to hydrate my skin. I can instantly see the difference, my skin just drinks this up. Perfectly absorbs instantly so my foundation goes on and stays on... doesn't melt off because this product is non greasy yet works all day and night until you wash it off. This is truly a product that I have and will continue to recommend. I am in my mid 40's with signs of aging. Deep wrinkles under my eyes and around my mouth. I have considered using botox and fillers but once I apply this Moisturizer gel into my skin the idea to go and to pay someone to stick needles with expensive ingredients in my face tends to cease. Put this morning and night and watch the compliments roll in... Take a selfie of a before and after and see what I mean. I would become a brand ambassador solely on my experience with this product... but I use many others of theirs too. And I am very, very happy with the results. I will not use any other moisturizer after this... the price is perfect but even more so is that it works. My skin is plump, dewy and hydrated.

I don't have an issue with the smell at all. My face is very sensitive and prone to breakouts on occasion. I didnt notice that it helped to increase breakouts nor did it diminish it. This does not get rid of, diminish, or smooth my pores, but it doesn't promise to do that, just to smooth and hydrate your skin, which is definitely does.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Let me make this clear: My skin is acne prone... VERY acne prone, and gets oily very quickly. And recently I've found that moisturizers actually regulate my skin very effectively and help to drastically keep oil production down. I bought this product as a daily moisturizer to use every morning before starting my makeup routine. I wanted something that would feed my skin moisture continuously throughout the day to keep my skin feeling bouncy, nourished, and soft all day. I wanted something a little less overwhelming than my usual moisturizer for the day time. I thought about getting the Aqua Bomb by Belief, but thought this may be a good dupe. It screamed hydration, and I've heard a ton of good things about it, so I thought I would give it a whirl. Whoo! However, I'm so upset, because it did absolutely nothing for my skin! I don't get it! It's not like I have extremely dry skin either. Pros: I love how it applies. Very cooling, gel like feel that spreads easily so a little goes a long way. Nice! Every day I put it on, did my makeup, and bam, I was out the door. It was only an hour or so into my day when I began to notice it: my skin feels dry... what the heck. Dry? Am I going crazy? I touch my skin and it feels tight and parched. What is this madness!? And all day it felt so dry and awful. Every single day it was like this, and my skin was miserable. Eventually I just gave up, because I couldn't stand it anymore. This moisturizer is just straight garbage and had no business being on my skin, plain and simple.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I'm always on the lookout for products that actually WORK so had to try this when my sister recommended it. I use it morning & night--it plumps up the skin under the eyes to help eliminate fine lines (I'm almost 60) & also works well for decolletage. I live in FL where it's either warm or hot so hate anything that leaves a sticky feeling--this completely absorbs quickly. I'm on my second jar and will definitely continue to use this. Only negative is you don't get much product for the price.,3,,

It's nothing I've ever experienced before. It felt like my face had been sitting in the sun for hours. So I decided to tried this because I remember using it in the past. I put it on in the car because I couldn't wait and it felt amazing. It feels so cool, refreshing, and doesn't dry my face out (I have combo of oily and dry). Plus it smells really good. My face looked better in just a few hours. It's been a few days and it brought my skin back to normal. I have sensitive skin anyway but it's hasn't felt this good in a long time.

If you have really dry skin then look for the jar that says ultra hydrating because they make two different kinds.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"Face lotion was my first beauty purchase as a young girl as I always saw it in my mother's beauty routine. Previously, I used Olay for about 12 years before I switched. Nothing was wrong with the old lotion but wow was I thrilled with this water gel lotion. The color and consistency lend to a cool to the touch feeling, a must have in southern Louisiana. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly which doesn't delay my makeup routine. I use this lotion twice a day with no build up or residue. My mom has also switched to this hydro gel, only right to share a great beauty find.

I have somewhat oily skin and I didn't want something that was too heavy that would grease me up even more. She pointed me towards this and I have bought it ever since. It's a great moisturizer to use after getting out of the shower on a clean face before applying my makeup.

I clean my face in the evening before bed and after doing so I use the moisturizer (a little goes a long way!)

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,I use this product morning and night. I have very oily acne probe skin. Does not irritate my skin or clog my pores. My skin has not been so oily since using this product because it helps to balance my oily skin. Only complaint is it does not have SPF so I cannot wear it on no makeup days.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,Purchased this hoping it would help my dry skin. It made it much worse. Very disappointed since I'd read so many great reviews. I had to use an additional moisturizer on top of this.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"This is a great product. So clean smelling. I am so glad I gave in and bought it. Along with leaving your face completely moisturized, i helped with reducing the look of acne scars.

Just great, clean, smooth skin left behind!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"okay! some said that your face will feel tight after you apply this on. YES IT DOES!! because it is closing up your pores. I also felt it when the first time I applied it on my face, like my whole face shrinks. But i just let it be. after two hours I found that my face does not look oily at all, normally I will have super oily on the T-zone area after two hours applying moisturiser, but this DONT!!!!! instead my face looks healthy and soft. of course, there will be a little oil on my t-zone but i'll just wipe it with oil paper. I've been using this for three weeks now. My pores are all closed up and yea less oily face. Breakouts still have but not much.",4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I was really hoping to like this product but not a fan at all. It feels refreshing for a quick moment but once it sinks in it makes my skin feel dry (like I just used a bad cleanser that gives you that tight feeling) the smell is not appealing to me, smells like old lady perfume or something.

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I have been looking for a product that was going to smooth out my face and give me that ""bounce"" back that the so wonderful Disney princess described in the commercial for this. I can say with full confidence that I have never used a better product. My face is so much smoother and softer than it EVER has been, and that is not even the slightest bit dramatic. I would rival my skin with my 3 year olds anytime! I have also always had a small issue with acne and overly oily skin, and some how this product even seems to be managing that. To think that I have picked up this item and put it back a hundred time because, like others I'm sure, I was so over spending a small fortune on another product that says one thing and does another. Worth every penny. Also though it seems like a small jar, a very little bit of this will go a long way!! So happy I bought this, I WILL be recommending this to all the women in my family!",4,,

Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"I wanted to love this stuff so bad. I have extremely sensitive skin, so much so that I use almost exclusively natural formulas. I really only got this for the hyaluronic acid. It makes my clear skin feel pretty soft and look really even, but if I ever get any of it over a breakout or broken skin, it seems to make the breakouts worse. That being said, it's great even for very sensitive skin, if you are careful with it. If your skin is totally clear, just dry, the gel is good for locking in moisture and evening skin tone. If you have any breakouts, it's best to let those heal completely before getting any of this gel on them.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,"My skin is generally dry with an oily T-zone, and this product has worked great for me!

A lot of my patients say they get good relief from the injections since it lubricates the joint and relieves the pain and inflammation. I thought i would give it a try and see what it does for my skin. Firstly I like the cooling affect it has. I use this only a night, after I wash my face and take off my makeup from the day, the cooling affect it has on the skin is very soothing. I like the consistency too, i never put a gel on my face before i do like this one. Its not greasy and absorbs really quickly into the skin.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I got suggested this by a very sweet employee for a hydrating face mask. I live hydrogel masks so i figured id give it a try. Im usually not sensitive to sheer masks but when i opened the package i could smell the strong fragrance immediately. After putting it on my face it felt super cooling and i enjoyed it. Once i looked at the ingredients however i saw the fragrance was super high on the list and i got concerned since my skin can be kinda sensitive to scent especially so high in the list. I left it on for the minimum time to be safe but once removed it and my skin touched the air it STUNG and was very inflamed. I immediately washed my face and moisturized and even the moisturizer tingled which meant my skin barrier was disrupted. Its day three after the mask and my skin is doinf way better but i would NOT recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin or honestly anyone to be honest. The cooling sensation was very nice but ill never understand why companies pack skincare with so much fake fragrance.,4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This product would never fully absorb into my skin, but also never made my skin feel that moisturized. It was also making me break out. I would definitely recommend looking for a different product.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Love !!! I have oily/combination skin and this is perfect. My skin drinks this. It absorbs so quick and leaves my skin soft and hydrated. I was looking for a Clinique moisture surge and this is definitely IT !,5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love the Neutrogena products, the only acne face wash that has ever worked for me has been their brand, so I tried this gel for the first time as my skin gets so dry in the winter. It's amazing for me. It is a little pricey for the small amount in the jar, that is my only personal con to this product if you watch your wallet like I do. Other than that, I couldn't compliment the face wash and water gel serum enough! Helps with my complexion so well & keeps my face smooth & hydrated.na@gmail",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This new formula is just not it for sooooo many reasons. It does everything it's not suppose to do. It use to be my primary everyday product I used. Not any more this new formula is simply trash and that's where it ended up.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This was my go-to moisturizer for YEARS! I loved the way it made my skin feel hydrated without feeling greasy or heavy. Sadly, I will no longer purchase this moisturizer because of the new formula. It made me break out and it gave me dry, red patches everywhere. It also burned upon application! It did everything the opposite of what a good moisturizer should do. They clearly cheapened their ingredients and it shows. Neutrogena, I was a loyal customer of yours for a long time. NO MORE!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This one is not fragrance free so people posting reviews it has a scent thats because you bought the wrong one. I love the hydro boost moisturizer it changed my skin and i love the glow and also it plumps my skin uo and foundation goes on so good,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have been using this everyday and love it. Makes my skin smooth and refreshed all day long.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've been using the same jar for over a year and there's still a lot left. Any moisturizer used heavily breaks me out, so I use only a small amount on the dry patches. I wish it were fragrance free, but otherwise good stuff.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Bring the old formula back,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Has frgrance which caused a reaction in my sensitive skin. I purchased this as it came recommended from a dermatologist, but unfortunately my sensitive skin was looking for hyaluronic acid and not frgrance so my face had a reddish breakout.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This product is not the same as the old gel cream they used to have. They said that is was just a repackaging but I think they changed the ingredients too. I started to break out and my skin go so dry and itchy after using this product. I do not have sensitive skin either. This product was the only thing that changed in my skin care. I don't like them rebranding and using different ingredients. They took away one of my favorite cleansers in the past too. Don't improve on products that have been doing so well for years!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I can't fully comment on how this affected my skin because I took it off immediately after I put it on - the SMELL, my goodness, the SMELL. If you're sensitive to strong fragrances, this product is not for you.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This gave me the worst acne I've ever had. Looking at the ingredients now it makes sense because it has Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Olivate, Laureth-7 and fragrance. Yikes!! I would not recommend this to anyone who deals with acne.",2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I used to love this product. All of my sisters also used it and we all agree that now the formula has definitely changed, there is a strong fragrance and it burns your skin . My face broke out after using this which never happened before. Skip",1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"The first & last time ive ever purchase this moisturizer,tried it & next day a pimple appeared and was like okay maybe my period is coming, but no! It wasnt my hormones! I got a different brand from mexico and was like okay im going to stay away from this just to see whats breaking me out, then my face flawless, second time i give it a try to find out then again 2 more pimples, i thought whats with my face or is it this moisturizer, tried for the 3 time and again pimples, and I know i should've trown it away already but I bought it in a bundle and i have like 3 of these,, but we're done here. My face doesn't deserves it. Thank you but no thank you.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This is a really great moisturizer. The only issue I seem to have is every time I start a new bottle my skin freaks out a little but it does settle and I can see a difference in my skins dryness. Bottle last for a long time too which is a plus,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,My skin is both sensitive and prone to adult acne. This is a perfect moisturizer for my skin. I usually use Clinique Jelly. This is very similar but I think it is a little more moisturizing. Non-irritating and doesn't break me out.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,If this product didn't have a fragrance that irritates my skin I would have been using it everyday.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,They changed the formula on this product and now it burns my skin! I have rosacea & sensitive skin so now the fragrance on this irritates my skin so much. The extra dry no fragrance used to be my holy grail!,4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"The original was a holy grail. There's a def change in formula. The new version has def changed the color, texture, fragrance, it absorbs slower. And makeup slides a lot faster than before.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I've been using this for years. It's my go to when i want a lighter moisturizer.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,My skin is super dry and has always been a struggle to treat on top of being sensitive. This leaves my skin happy and hydrated.,3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This product is a joke. The material feels disgusting. The product wouldn't work for 10x the ammount of time they recommend to keep it on your face. Don't waste your money.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"i was disappointed with this product. i have sensitive and combo skin, this product burnt and broke me out :(. it feels really nice on the skin initially then really burnt.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"It's more moisturizing than a heavy cream, but it so light!!!! I was sure it wouldn't work when I felt the watery texture, but I've tried them all and this is the best.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I used this product along with the gel cream for years and both formuals have changed and they are ruined. The water gel burned my face enough to keep it red for an hour and the gel cream is now so heavy on the face it wont absorb into the skin leaving it sticky.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"When I got into skincare a few years ago, I experienced with so many new brands/products: Belif Aqua Bomb, CosRx All in One Snail Cream, Avene Aquage Moisture Gel, etc. The Hydro Boost Gel is still my favorite, and no other product has outperformed it.",1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This may be the worst sheet mask I've tried. It says its a hydrogel mask, great. Just peel the white backing off and place on fave, sure‚Ä¶. Except the backing snt really stuck to the gel mask, so it doesnt come out of the package in an orderly fashion. Mine didnt have eye holes or the mouth part cut out, and the mask itself was too small for my (average sized) face. Fail for me. Especially for the price.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love this for daily use, in the mornings, after what ever serum I am using. It absorbs well so is great under makeup. It's probably not moisturizing enough on its own though.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,If they ever discontinue this I wont recover this. This literally saved my skin as someone with really oily skin this helps my makeup stay on all day. Ive tried the fragrance free version amd its just not the same. The consistency is amazing and it feels amazing.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Nice and fun and smells good too I love it would recommend to friends and co family members,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I bought this product twice so it is safe to say I am not going to buy it again. I have combination/oily skin and this really left my face dry. I was shocked because it was summer and I sweat alot. I didn't see any real benefits at all from it after using it for three months and all.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I like this product! It certainly did not cause me to break out, which is huge because a lot of moisturizers do. However, it did not moisturize as well as I hoped it would. I have very dry skin, and had been using Kiehls Ultra Facial Cream prior to trying this. I was hoping this would be a less expensive alternative, but after about 6 weeks of using this, I am definitely starting to get a bit dry again. This product also doesn't last nearly as long as Kiehls UFC, so back to Kiehls it is!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This is my go-to when I can't get my hands on the Loops beauty masks. My face feels very hydrated after I use it. I also like the brightening results I get when I apply makeup afterwards. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because of the fragrance. If you have sensitive skin, I recommend patch testing first.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have combo oily&dry skin, and this did absolutely nothing for me. It also has a very strong floral scent which I didnt like",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Oh how I LOVE these. Great to keep in the fridge. I use them more during winter months. My favorite is to use them before I do a full face of makeup. They help everything go on smoother. I pack them in my suitcase and put them in hotel mini fridges, especially if I'm in a drier climate",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have pretty oily skin and I found it hard to wear a face moisturizer every day bc it seemed like everything just made me look and feel greasy by the end of the day. This stuff is lightweight and makes my skin feel smooth and clean. Smells good too,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This is an okay moisturizer. Light weight with medium hydration. The problem is that if you try to layer it with other skin care or makeup it tends to pill up.,4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I am a ratburger, I live in ratburgerLandia. I have very dry and hot skin. I live on the equator. This helped my skin be soft and cold. I recommend buying if your skin is dry and hot. Especially if you live on the equator.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have very sensitive skin and almost every single moisturizer I have tried has caused me to breakout‚Ä¶ until this. This makes my skin look so beautiful and glowy while still moisturized!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I just purchase this product n used it twice n already have noticed it DRYING out my OILY skin. The fragrence is a little much for a face product n im never sensitive too fragrance. It does leave the skin feeling soft inbetween the dry patches it will give you. Iv been on the hunt for a water based moisturizer for my oily skin, and I guess the hunt continues.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This moisturizer feels so great and soft and lightweight for the summer and it helps acne go away. It also has a great price,2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,honesty i have been looking for something to compare to clinique moisture surge since that has been my go to for sooo long but ts just so expensive so i looked into this brand. when i tell you i honestly may even like this better... it trult leaves my skin feeling super hydrated without a heavy oily feeling. its so lightweight and feels like nothing while making my skin look super glowy and just amazing. highly recommend this.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Over the years I've tried several different hyaluronic acids, some considered more high-end, others more consumer friendly prices. This is the best one I have ever used. It's very lightweight and absorbs in quickly without leaving any kind of residue behind. It really does make the skin look more hydrated and plumped, where others have left my skin looking crepey around my eyes when I would smile, leave a residue, or never really absorbed. There's a reason this brand has such a solid reputation. Other bands rely more on the name, not the quality. This will be my go-to for hyaluronic acid products. I have no reason to look at another brand for a product like this. What's that old saying, ""When you have the best, forget the rest?""",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I found this product years ago and have repurchased time and time again. My skin is always plump and hydrated with this product. It absorbs into the skin quickly and really hydrates without leaving your skin feeling oily. I use this morning and night and my skin loves it!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I wanted to try this since I heard it was a ""dupe"" for the clinque moisture surge moisturizer line. It isn't a terrible product, but it's not anywhere close to as moisturizing as the Clinque product is and it has a strong chemical smell.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Literally, hands down, best moisturizer. Just get it and at least try it. I have combination skin, oily tzone and dry everywhere else. It doesnt break out my tzone and keeps me hydrated. I have tried COUNTLESS of moisturizers. I've been using this for a year now, I haven't found anything better than this. I've got my MIL and my mom hooked on this stuff (age 50's). I love it!",2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Ok so i have combo skin that is oily in my t-zone and dry pretty much everywhere else. I used to have to apply so much powder on my nose to try and hide my oil. BUT since using this it has balanced my skin so well!!! I also have acne prone skin and it helped moisturize and clear up my skin. Im not even joking when i say this absorbs so fast. And my skin is so soft. 10/10 recommend,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"i was really hoping i would love this product, because most of the reviews are very good. my dry skin did not like this prpduct in the least, and after applying it, it made my face feel like it was burning. it made me very red, and caused some flaky dry spots on my face.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Recommend,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I cant get pass the smell,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I am a very oil skin type but at the same time in winter my skin go super dry and this water gel all year long has my fave covered. I feel my skin 100% hydrated and my makeup now feels and visible is amazing. My face no longer generates to much oil. So my makeup and my face look good all day.,1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Bought this about three months ago and i don't hate it but it's definitely more for dry skin. I have extremely oily skin and also sensitive it has some fragance which i did not like but is a good product for dry/combination skin.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use this all the time and i love it so much! I live in a state where it's constantly dry so this moisturizer is absolutely perfect for me.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"My face felt like it was burning after applying this product. It also caused redness in my neck area. Wanted to love it since this is one of the few moisturizers out there that is truly non-comedogenic, but my sensitive skin couldn't handle it",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I hate lotions or anything that feels like its trapping my skin with a layer of oil or leaves it greasy. That obviously applies to my face as well. Most moisturizers are heavy, and while they ate effective, they're just not right for me. Neutrogena's Water Based Gel is incredible though! It is extremely hydratinf and plumps my skin, but is almost completely absorbed within minutes. It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth and not like I have a layer of, well‚Ä¶lotion on it. I use a satin pillowcase, and it is dry enough within just a couple minutes to lay down and not feel like I'm sticking to the pillowcase. If you have any sensory adversities to traditional moisturizers, this is a godsend. So lightweight and absorbent. It has a light smell, but its a fresh smell, almost what you would expect ""water"" to smell like, but nothing floral and no strong perfume smell. I've tried several other water-based and they have not given me the same results or the same lightweight feel and absorbency. This is definitelt my #1.",1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,My skin looked plumper and smoother after 20 min. I recently purchased more to make this mask a weekly ritual.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"You need this! This is the only moisturizer ive found (so far) that actually leaves my skin feeling hydrated, glowing - yet DOESN'T cause excess oil/sebum production. Can be used either time of the day, can be a bit heavy but absorbs very quickly. Price point is not bad at all! Has a clean smell, and a pretty simple yet cute packaging. Its a 10/10 for me. Definitely lives up to the hype.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I feel like I need to use moisturizer after I use this. It might boost hydration as the package states, but for me, it doesn't suffice as a moisturizer after washing with cleanser.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Really helps dry skin,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Decent product for the price. I was in a pinch and out of my favorite product, so I figured I would give this a try. I have oily, acne prone skin. It did not cause my skin to breakout or produce more oil throughout the day. I would buy this product again.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"The formulation of their gel cream products is phenomenal. However, yesterday I returned the regular Hydro boost because I opened it to be blasted in the face with headache inducing fragrance. I don't even know why you would put fragrence in a face cream. Then today I just used the cream gel for hands, and again with the fragrance. And it is strong. I have no idea why these things have fragrance in them, but I have to return this as well because I have hand eczema. Please, Neutrogena, stop with a fragrance. It is not necessary and it is a major irritant.",4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Love this moisturizer! I have oily skin and this moisturizer does not add to my shine. Does not pill over other products. Moisture last all day. It is super light weight couldn't recommend this product more!,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I used it and it burned my skin. its light and smells good. personally for dry skin it burns, and i did have a break out but i think because my skin is sensitive it products. on the other hand my mom uses it and it has reduces her red tones and oils.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"figured we would try this Neutrogena face mask, I usually love their stuff. this is a hard pass. it was sliding all over my face. not relaxing at all",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I'm new to the product, so far so good. The problem is the price. I saw this at other stores for ten bucks cheaper! It's sad that a store that promotes beauty would do such an ugly thing to its customers by overcharging for their products!",1,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love the feeling of the hydration from the mask but the product is SO WATERY and the mask is jelly-like mask so it's unbelievably slippery when trying to put it on. Their was so much watery essence left in the pouch when I finally put the mask on, seemed like a waste. But I couldn't put it on my face because it was truly the same consistency as water. It took me about 3 minutes to actually get the mask on my face because how slippery this was. It would be better if it was cloth material. This is not worth it. Just buy the other leave on products but not this mask.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,honestly the gel is light and would be nice for those who have very oily and strong skin but with me with combination and sensitive skin.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I randomly found this holy grail about 6 years ago and it is my all time favorite. I use it before special events or when I want my skin to look and feel really good. Its so hydrating and it feels so good to have on, does not burn at all. I recommend using it for the full 30 minutes, that way it really absorbs the moisture and you only have to pat in a little excess at the end. 10/10 would recommend",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have been using this for almost 2 years and this stuff gave me the worst cystic acne I have ever had. I didn't realize this was causing it until about a month ago after I tried every medicine and topical from the derm and nothing was working, I decided to try switching my moisturizer and sure enough my skin cleared up almost immediately. I haven't had a single pimple in almost a month and this was the only product I changed from my routine. also if your skin is flaky dry this will do nothing for you.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,It's not a perfect product. The mask could fit my face better. If you're looking for a little dose of hydration in addition to your daily moisturizing routine this is a great option. However when I traveled to a drier climate I used one of these to try and help my skin adjust to the lack of humidity and it didn't do too much to help my overly dry skin. Lathering more of my regular moisturizer on seemed to work better than this in that case.,3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I went into my local Ulta to find something for my face because i had noticed some dry bumbs toward my chin etc. I figured it was from wearing makeup (I started to wear more frequently) but it wasn't anywhere else.

I'm not exaggerating either. My skin is very sensitive and this absorbs well, leaves my skin very soft and hydrated. I only cleanse and apply it (i use it at night) and wake up with perfectly hydrated skin. NOT OILY, doesn't burn, doesn't smell weird, easy to use. I even bought one for my boyfriend! I loved it. I can't even add any cons.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've used this for a couple years now and I've always loved it. Maybe I just got so used to it I never really appreciated it. But lemme tell you. I ran out of this for almost 2 weeks. I just did not have time to get to the store for it between work and kids and busy life. My skin took an absolute beating. I was still using the rest of my skincare, just not this. I started breaking out horribly and my skin felt so dry and gross. I got some before work and put it on in the car and my face came back to life in about 2 minutes. It felt so good on my skin and it already feels and looks better. Long story short I will never go without this again.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"The first time using the hydro boost moisturizer it was fine, it actually gave me a cool cold feeling when I would apply.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"It was cool at first but I noticed over time that my eyes developed a rash (I use a few products so I didn't know this was responsible).

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I love using this mask. It hydrates my skin and leaves my irritated skin feeling soo supple. What some people don't realize with hyaluronic acid is your skin needs to be damp in order for it to not dry your skin out and use a cream afterwards.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I've been looking for a new moisturizer for a while now. Honestly I've been looking for one that wasn't super pricey but still good quality. I decided to try the trial size of this to see if it would do the job and so far it has! It literally feels like thick water if that makes sense and the smell is super light. It makes my skin smooth and definitely helps with dryness. Definitely recommend!,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This product feels so nice on my skin, it does the job so well of both moisturizing & hydrating my face. When I initially tried this my skin was often dry & flaky, now that I regularly apply this water gel everyday it makes my skin look dewy & plump. I recommend keeping it in the fridge, just cause it feel extra soothing when it's nice & cool.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I just started a harsh acne topical treatment to help with breakouts / texture and my skin has been terribly dry & a lot of burning! so far this is the ONLY product to help my skin! every time i use it my skins feels so good immediately and lasts! compared to all the aloe, aquaphor, and expensive creams this is the only one that works. 100% recommend!",3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Back story: I switched facial cleansers and it caused a horrible dead skin problem on my face. I couldn't even put on makeup because my face was so dry, to the point of sloughing off, like a bad sunburn... I googled the best options for very dry skin and this came up. I started using the Hydroboost wipes and this gel once at night... Four days of using the product and my dry skin has almost completely cleared up! I highly recommend it. The scent is light. It feels good on your skin. The wipes are very convenient.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This is my go to moisturizer for sure and when someone asks what I use, this is what I recommend. I am a big neutrogena fan anyway, but this product is everything. It's not heavy, my skin drinks it up and makes my skin look fabulous all day.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I wanted to love this product so bad, but it just didn't work out for me personally.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Purchased the travel size as a tester and will be purchasing the regular size. Keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day. Only down side is that is dries down a little tacky but it goes away with time.,4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Really good for people who have oily skin but still needs that hydration without adding to the oil it's a gel like texture that sinks in with ease!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have combination skin, and this moisturizer is perfect for it in the summer. I have been using it in the morning for about 3 months and my face doesn't get as oily throughout the day- it's very light weight and clean!

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I buy this mask all the time and each time I use it I see immediate results. It feels great while I'm using it especially in summer.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"okay so starting off my skin isnt the best; it used to be worse than it is now but still not amazing. ive had issues with impetigo, eczema, bad acne in the past and overall very sensitive skin. i have to use specific products so i don't have irritation or triggers to these issues. its been around 2 years since they have started to slow down + washing my face twice every day helped quite a bit. i ran into this product and thought it would be good for my hygiene and possibly moisturizing my face,, so i bought it. for the first couple days i used it lightly on my face n it seemed to work okay yet i didn't see much of a difference. honestly, i forgot about it for a couple days therefore i came back to it after a bit. i decided to put a little more on than usual and it BURNED. i wasn't totally sure if it was supposed to do that so i just let myself suffer for a little while(stupidly) and came back to my face red, like almost tomato red. around the middle of my face. its been 2 weeks since this incident and its still red, yet not as severe. do not purchase if you have had past skin issues or current !!! it will do worse for yourself and leave you with redness on your face for a long while.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,It's an amazing daily moisturizer! My skin stayed moisturized all day.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I actually love better than the Clinique Moisture Surge. They work very similar for a lower price. I feel a little goes a long way with the Neutrogena. You don't need to over pile this moisturizer on your face because it spreads nicely. I use it day and night. When I wake up my face still feels moisturized. I will buy this again.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Burns my skin sometimes and i have to reapply ever few hours. It is moisturizing and nice but for such a small jar, the price isn't worth it :( i wanted to love this but i guess it works more for others than some",4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,FINALLY I have found a moisturizer that 1. Doesn't feel thick and greasy when I put it on 2. Doesn't dry out my skin (even though I have oily skin) and 3. Doesn't make me break out (I have very sensitive skin) I will buy this forever and ever,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,worked for the first month maybe but it ended up burning my skin and it wasn't just a burning sensation. My skin was red and irritated around the corners of my mouth and cheeks.,5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I just recently purchased this product and am using it on my hands hoping it will help with the severe dryness. I know it's supposed to be for the face but am trying it on my hands. Can't recommend it yet until I see results.,4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Burns my skin! My skin is so clear with this and the cleanser I use. Since I stopped using this because of the burning sensation, I have really bad break outs. I've been considering switching back to this because I can't find a product right for me.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I gave this a shot after hearing so many raving reviews and I could not be more disappointed. The first application was not bad but afterwards I noticed how dry my typically oily skin was. Next application burned and left my skin bright red followed by even more dry, flaky areas.",4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This is my 8th jar. I love how my face feels now. Found a travel size for a friend. Now she is hooked too I am an old person, and this is the best thing I use in morning, evening and before I apply make up.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,After I exfoliate I use this to replenish the skin. I love to put it in the fridge overnight or freeze for a minute to get it cool before using. I notice a difference the next day after using it. I like it more than other masks and I like that the mask itself is a gel texture. If you want moisture but you have oily skin this is it.,3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This product I had high hopes for to help with my majorly dry winter skin. I paid entirely too much for this to of only been able to use twice! The first application it did what I thought it would, made my skin feel soft. I was hoping for a deeper hydration but was still okay with it. Day 2 I noticed how dry my skin was when I woke up so I applied again and it instantly started burning. By day 3 my skin is 100x more dry than before I started using this product and now I'm red and patchy as well sooooo.....this turned out to be absolute garbage for me!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I use this in the a.m. and p.m. moisturizing routine. I have had dry skin my whole life and this moisturizer keeps my face, neck and chest soft and moisturized all day and night. Wish they also had a body lotion with the same ingredients.",1,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have been using this for a long time. Great hydration for older skin,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I rarely have write reviews to products but when I received this as a gift and when i used it the sheet mask itself had an rough texture and my skin got super itchy then when I took it off I was extremely red and blotchy. My skin also seemed drier which does not make sense if it is supposed to be a ""hydrating 100%"" mask. I used lots of soothing products to get back to a somewhat normal skin barrier for like a week. Maybe my experience has something to do with the fact that there is more fragrance than Hyaluronic Acid in the product. Just because I had a bad reaction doesn't mean you will, BUT when Neutrogena is very misleading saying ""Non-comedogenic formula is gentle on dry skin and won't clog pores"" WHEN THE PRODUCT HAS MORE FRAGRANCE THAN HYALURONIC ACID. please do better neutrogena",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I live in south Florida so decided to purchase this to use as a summer daytime moisturizer as it was lightweight and absorbs easily. I don't consider myself to have sensitive skin, however this gel made my skin burn. I now use the Shiseido water gel which I really love (although those who don't like fragrance should steer clear).",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Best mask ever. It's the only sheet mask I buy from here. Even with my sensitive skin I haven't had an issue.,1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I bought this hoping it would be a cheaper tatcha moisturizer dupe. The first time using this it gave me a terrible rash and burn. It smells like soap. My skin feels 'tacky' rather than moisturized. My face becomes very warm as well.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I love this moisturizer. I've repurchased many times now. This makes my face so smooth and clear!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Feel so good to put on because it's so soothing but doesn't keep my face moisturized and makes my skin feel super dry and definitely making my face super itchy . 1/10,3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have such a bone to pick about the smell. It's like straight up bug spray. I'm going to try the fragrance free eventually but I'm poor (lol) and I wish I had known how bad/irritating the smell would be.,1,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"bought this hoping it would help my skin. i used it for 3 days at night and every time i applied it it would burn hella bad. i now have eczema patches on my face (i used to have eczema but found products to get rid of it, this brought it back). i have never ever had a reaction to a moisturizer like this before. really frustrated that after 3 days of use it left my skin damaged.",1,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Doesn't do what it says. My skin felt super dry.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I was so excited to try this, but was hesitant on buying the full size of the product so I bought the travel size one. I was impressed with how quickly it absorbed into my skin until it started to tingle and burn. I also started to get these dry patches by my eyes and my makeup did not look great on my skin anymore. My skin started to turn red in some areas and was overall not happy with the change in routine. I thought that it would be very moisturizing, but every time I used it it felt like I had swam in a chlorine pool for hours as my face felt so tight. Would not recommend for those with dry or sensitive skin.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,It felt like my skin was taking a big drink of water when I put this on,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,way too much fragrance. Im a licensed esthetician and not sure why companies ruin products with fragrance that are horrible for your skin. stay away from fragrance. this product is very irritating on the skin.,1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I bought this since I was traveling out of state, figured how bad could a water gel be? OMG it left huge red painful streaks across my face and neck less than 5 mins later and a few were so bad they blistered like a burn! It took 12 days for my skin to go back to normal after using it only 1 time :( save your skin and don't use it!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This moisturizer completely hydrated my skin. I was dealing with very flaky, dry patches and my makeup would just sit on top of that and look terrible. I used this morning & night for three days & it fixed that issue completely unlike others I've tried! So glad to have found this.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"For some reasons this burnt my face terribly and my skins in no way sensitive. I've had chemical peels done before, have used retinol, salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, etc. And none of those burnt me so i find this so strange. It went straight into the trash. waste of money",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This is one of my favorites sheet masks. Affordable and easy to use.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've always had very dry skin and I feel like I've tried just about every moisturizer out there without any luck. A friend recommended this product and I figured why not and oh my gosh! Instant hydration! I actually store this in my mini fridge that I use for skincare and it feels so refreshing and cooling upon application! And I find that it smells really nice. Like most moisturizers, it doesn't absorb immediately but I find that it absorbs rather quickly (by the time I'm done getting ready, it's all absorbed). My sensitive skin also agrees with it which is a huge plus for me!",2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"When the pandemic started, I started taking care of my skin more often than I did prior to covid. I have dry skin and hyperpigmentation on my forehead. When I purchased this item for the first time, I was surprised about the hydration and water like feel, I got with this product. Along with a good SPF, my skin cleared in a matter of weeks! I would recommend this product for those with dry skin.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I found this moisturizer totally ineffective for my naturally very dry skin. I take vitamins every day and drink 1 gallon of water every day as well because I exercise every day. This product really did nothing for my skin. However, I found it was great to add to any of my foundations to create a more natural and sheer coverage without it tampering with the formula of the foundation. That may be because the formula is very very watery, but if you need something like that for your foundation, I'd recommend using this, but only for that purpose. I used the entire jar and did not change anything else about my skin care routine. Luckily it did not cause breakouts or irritation, so it's sensitive skin friendly it seems! If you don't have very dry skin naturally, maybe this would work just fine. But for the price per oz, I'm not at all impressed",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have (had) SUPER dry skin. Like constantly peeling no matter what I did or tried. I just gave up looking because the only ones that WOULD work were $50+. Anyway, my mom let me try out some of hers and my skin was immediately BEYOND happy. It's like I gave my skin a drink of water after being in a desert for 3 years.

BUT, in the winter I have *crazy* dry skin and using this was the equivalent of splashing water on my face... didn't do a thing. I returned after 3 tries. Maybe I could use it in the summer when I sweat all the time but if you are looking for something hydrating and moisturizing this is not the one.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've used other hylauronic products that were sticky and didn't make my face feel any different, but this one leaves my face feeling dewy, smooth and super hydrated. My only critique is the amount of HA is unknown, they don't state how much it has and it's towards the bottom in the ingredients list.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I love this mask and it's the only sheet mask I actually feel like I get results from. I love that the serum doesn't drip down your neck and face while you wear it and the mask is always secure while I do my day to day activities‚Äîtwo stars removed because they keep raising the price and you can find it cheaper pretty much anywhere else.,4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Love this product,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Absorbs really well not heavy or sticky. In less than a week I'm noticing that my skin feels softer and not nearly as dry as when I started using it. I like it enough that I've already picked up a second jar.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have used this product two times now, and both times after using it you can see the difference in your skin. I especially recommend this for people who have dry skin. My face was glowing after this, but of course you should use this at least once a week.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,So I bought this in hopes that it would eliminate the dry skin from my facial. I was peeling pretty bad around my chin and temple from the facial I had Tuesday before Easter. Hydro boost is amazing and turned my flaky skin to smooth and hydrated extremely fast! I love the smell and the outcome is worth the buy!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This peel and place mask really makes your face feel plumped with moisture in just 15 minutes.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I love this moisturizer!! It works great for my dry skin and it feels very cooling. My only problem is that the prize keeps increasing.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This completely ruined my skin. I'm 17 and before using this my skin was pretty much completely smooth. I'm usually picky with what i use on my face but a family member recommended this to me so i used it without looking at the ingredients (which are awful and filled with silicones by the way) I woke up the morning after using it ONCE and my skin was red, bumpy, and swollen. I haven't broken out like this since i was like 13. I am FUMING. I have no idea how to get my skin back to how it was now, or how long it will take. Like i don't mean to be a Karan but oh my god please don't use this on your face. It would probably be nice as a hand cream or something",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I seriously love this stuff so much. Love the entire Hydro Boost line.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I got the travel size of this, as I do with anything new I want to try, and I'm glad I did. I have been looking for a cheaper option than the dermologica calm waters gel as I have pretty sensitive skin. I tried it over 2 days, morning and night and Overall it didn't turn my face red which was great, and it really made my face feel great but I couldn't use it every day due to the unfortunate scent. As soon as I put it on it was non stop sneezing for about 20-30 minutes. The scent does fade eventually but it is so intense when it first goes on and it was just to much.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have been using this for over a week now and I have been very happy with it. My skin tends to get a little dry in spots, and I wanted to try a moisturizer that wasn't thick. This is the perfect mix of lightweight and hydration!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have oily/combo skin so I was concerned at first since it's supposedly catered towards dry skin. I've been having tons of dry patches lately and my skin had been looking extremely cakey with my previous moisturizer. After switching to the water gel, my skin has been so soft and matte throughout the day. My skin feel moisturized but not greasy at all. It's so good!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I hate the greasy feeling it leaves, I hate the way it always has a smell to it, and I hate how expensive they are! BUT, this moisturizer? This is a life saver!!! Oh my goodness, it has no after feeling, so light weight it literally blends into your skin almost like butter but without the thickness! It has no smell, a little how's such a long way and it's actually aided in my chronic dry skin!!! I've only been using this for 3 days but already I see a HUGE difference",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,i really like this moisture and how it applies because my skin is oily and this is heavily recommended by lots of dermatologists and such. but this stuff makes my face BURN when i don't have sensitive skin whatsoever. i think it even made me break out. even my old ponds was better than this. the search for a perfect moisturizer continues...,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I bought this for my daughter. She wont use anything else.,1,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Works amazing,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have dry skin and I got this mask for 'hydrating' my skin. However my skin had never been dried after using a Hydrating mask. It leaves no moisture on face at all. That makes me think if it's only for 'oily' skin,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I liked how hydrating and cooling the mask was. It fits face nicely with it being two pieces. But it was difficult to apply onto face, it came folded and was difficult to unfold and tell which side to apply. Not bad but there's so many other options easier to apply.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"it's a moisturizing mask, but on the heavy side. It comes in 2 pieces: one for the top portion of my face and one for the bottom half. The bottom half kept sliding off.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have only used this for one week and it has already changed my skin dramatically, i suffer from acne and let me tell you my face is so smooth now. Perfect for oily skin, this is a must.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I read a comment on the fragrance being repulsive. Nothing could be further from the truth in my experience. It has a very light, pleasant fragrance, that disappears quickly as it melts into my skin. My skin feels moist without being sticky. What more can you ask of a moisturizer? Will purchase again.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Apply after Aha cleanse, toner in am, & after a midday shower",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I simply love this. It does make my skin smooth for foundation.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"was excited to get this because my friend liked it and it was in many articles about moisturizer for oily skin. The first thing i saw was that it had fragrance and coloring in the ingredients. those aren't necessary and it was a red flag right away. even though i used a good amount it left my forehead looking scaly. it made my nose burn and turn red. after a while it was stinging. i washed it off and put my other moisturizer on and it cleared up immediately. the next day my skin was still irritated and i had hives on my jaw and in my nose (i had put extra around my nose because it gets rly dry), and hives on my chin which were very painful and took the elasticity away for that time. neutrogena has never been my friend. i was hopping this one would be different but i guess not. still terrible and frivolous ingredients.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This product came recommended by multiple people, so I wanted to give it a try! I have combination skin that tends to get reallyyyyyy dehydrated in the winter, especially under my eyes and on my cheeks, and I was desperate to increase my skin's hydration. This moisturizer did wonders the first few times I used it, but one morning I woke up with a swollen eyelid and red, itchy, dry skin. (I hadn't introduced anything else into my skin routine or into my home during that few days, so it had to have been the moisturizer that caused the reaction.) I had to take medicine to stop the reaction (though it was a very minor reaction in the scheme of allergic reactions, so don't be too concerned). The ingredient list for this does not look super agitating and has some good elements, so I'm not sure exactly why I had this reaction, but I unfortunately won't be using the product again. That being said, I think it could just be a personal sensitivity of mine, so I don't want to entirely blame the product. But if you have even slightly sensitive skin like I do...maybe don't use it. Or at least start out by using it on a small patch of skin for a few days.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This is the only mask I've tried that looks and feels like it's made a difference after I've used it.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use this product after washing my face in the morning or night and it always leaves my face feeling super soft. It's lightweight and dries quickly. The best part is that it's not oily at all and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I bought the travel size first as a trail and loved it so I ended up buying the full size. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lightweight face moisturizer.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Disappointing. Messy to get out of package and put on. Doesn't hydrate. When I take it off my face feels dry. No thank you. Would not buy again or recommend. Price point is good but other then that no thanks,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love this product so much! I'm addicted to serums, but nothing else I've used has produced such instant improvements in the texture of my skin. I feel like I have 'de-aged' many years after using this. My skin looks plumped with hydration and smooth. I use it morning and night (it doesn't take much) along with a few other products that I have been using, like a collagen/peptide serum and vitamin C serum.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"My skin has been super dry this winter so I was looking for something more hydrating than I normally use. I loved how 'wet' this product felt when I applied it, however, I started forming rashes/chapping easily on my face where I had dry spots. I wasn't sure if it was this product or not so switched off it while my chapping healed, and then gave it another shot. Instantly the chapping came back. Definitely pretty disappointed I couldn't finish the jar. Will have to give it another try in the summer when it's less dry.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have really oily skin, so I feel like moisturizers are either too light, or leave my skin extra oily. This is neither of those! It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated without it feeling greasy or too oily. Love, love, LOVE this product!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This stuff literally makes my face feel like a baby's bottom! I read from a dermatologist that you should put this stuff on after you cleanse and while your face is still wet. It's amazing!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"After cleansing with Neutrogena cleanser and toner, then apply this product. Can use day or night or both.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have used several moisturizers and this one is the best by far. Its light and lasts all day,4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"applying this burns my skin! i thought that maybe that was a sign that it was working, but then a day or two later i notice some peels around my nose and eyes. i thought that might've just been sunburn, considering the fact that i used this during the summer, so i kept using it. the more and more i used it, the more and more my skin kept peeling. it looked so awful, i had to wear sunglasses everywhere i went. maybe my skin just isn't compatible with what's in this product.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have normal skin, more on the dry side during colder season so I need a lot of hydration for my face. I usually use facial moisturizers that are a little thicker so maybe my skin just needs to adjust. This gel doesn't seem to give my skin the hydration it normally receives.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This was a great daytime moisturizer on my oily skin. I loved the consistency and it helped my skin feel moisturized without a greasy feeling that I get with most other moisturizers. However, it has a very strong scent that I couldn't get over. I usually don't mind fragrance in my skincare products but this felt like applying fabric softener to my face. If this were unscented I'd totally buy again, but as it stands, I won't be repurchasing. I definitely recommend it to someone with oily skin who doesn't mind stronger scents, however.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Packaging was bad, as soon as you open it everything just slides down and separates from each other.

The hydration is okay but not worth the trouble it gave me.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Left my dry yet very oily acne prone skin looking and feeling hydrated. I was amazed. I also my pores looked smaller.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This dries down matte so I don't suggest wearing it with foundation unless it is moisturizing. It feels amazing and not greasy whatsoever. It also sort of sits on the skin, a small con. It alone looks and feels very nice but will not make you look hydrated if you wear makeup overtop of it",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"good for oily skin, love the texture",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love this product!!! I have normal to oily skin, which can make it hard to find a good moisturizer, but this works perfectly!

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have used moisturizers from dermalogica, Clinique and so many more and this is the BEST moisturizer I have ever tried.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Okay so I really wanted to like this, but this was one of the worst Purchase I've ever made. I picked this up as a temporary replacement for my Clinique moisture surge after hearing it was a dupe. It does not compare in any area except maybe the overall texture of the product itself. The first thing I noticed as soon as I opened it was the strong Fragrance which I'm not a fan of Due to sensitivities, it feels very refreshing upon application with a nice cooling Affect. After 1 day of using it I noticed my skin was a little More irritated then normal and my rosacea was inflamed, move on to day 2 and my face is completely broken out with a cystic acne Flare up all over my cheeks, jawline, and hairline. My Rosacea is inflamed and peeling in spots. I'm very disappointed in the quality and ingredients in this product Especially coming from Neutrogena a brand we are supposed to trust for sensitive skin. It took me over 5 months to get my cystic acne and RosaceaI calmed and almost completely gone I'm very upset I have to try and do it all over again and this was the only added new product in my routine the other products I've been using for months.I will not repurchase or recommend",3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This gave me a stinging / burning sensation when applying. I still used it for a few days. Felt like my skin was moisturized at first then a few hours later was back to super dry. Ill be switching back to Clinique Moisture Surge,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have acne prone dry/oily skin and I have been battling extremely dry skin for a couple months now. I tried this product once and felt immediate results.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"You advertise yourself as the epitome of skin care health and well being . I purchased this today . Stupidly - instead of reading ingredients , I was in a hurry and I thought to trust such a reputable brand. My mistake... because when I got home and looked over the ingredient list while unpacking it - this stuff contains 5 (YES FIVE) different types of dimethicone. In fact, hyaluronic acid isn't even listed until the very bottom which means they maybe only put a drop of it per each 100 gallons - I mean seriously that little . But hey, who cares right? With that much dimethicone, your face will look smooth and plump (that is: until u wash it off) . This stuff is about as useful as splashing your face with toilet water and Vaseline and calling it a wrinkle cure. We need to hold our beauty companies to MUCH higher standards. If we can create massive changes in how many shades a foundation can be in... why can't we make them stop lying to us about what we are putting on our precious skin???",1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I actually liked this moisturizer, it made my face soft. BUT why did they need to add blue dye to it?? This makes it all the scarier considering that my skin ""soaks"" it up. Regardless of how my skin feels after I use it, this is so unnecessary. Will not be buying or recommending.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This cream is better than most expensive creams. I used so many others and as soon as I switched to this.... Bam oils controlled and face less red. I will make sure to never stray from this ever.,5,,

I am a teenager so i could have just woken up w hormonal pimples but it was just a little random that I put it on the a few hours later had pimples.

This product was the culprit. I hesitated putting it on my face again after the first time I tried it because the fragrance is unnecessarily strong, and I like scented things. I could smell it for hours after I put it on. Also, the product has dye/coloring in it which seems like just another unnecessary ingredient, especially for a face cream.

I love the way that my face feels hydrated and fresh but doesn't look oily ! I'm looking forward to buying the bigger version once I finish the mini !! I definitely recommend this product !!!! One tiny little set back is that it irritates me just a tiny bit around my nose and chin but not a lot so that's good !,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I love this product for the summer because it feels cool when you put it on your face and it's great for day time moisturizer but I don't find that it's moisturizing enough for night time since my skin is very dry!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Amazing! Try it out!,2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've been using this for years and it makes my skin feel super soft. Lasts all day and doesn't have that heavy lotion feeling when it is applied. The fragrance is stronger than normal, but it doesn't affect me personally.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I typically use this product in the morning after cleansing my face. I get redness easily since I have dry and sensitive skin, but this always brings hydration to my face!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"As an after-wash moisturizer I was not impressed. It's kind of greasy,feels like it sits on the skin, then an hour later you have dry patches (?)",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've been using this for awhile now, and it is my Holy Grail! Since I started using this gel, my face has felt so smooth and baby soft. I have combination skin, and I'll occasionally get some acne and/or really dry skin. Because of this, it took me a long time to find a moisturizer that was super hydrating but not oily or greasy. I tried a few other brands, and they were alright, but this is my ALL TIME FAVORITE! The results are almost immediate; I'll wake up the next morning with super soft skin. I 100% recommend this, and I am NEVER buying anything other than this.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This product offers a nice almost silky feeling base after applying, however... that's due to the moisture sucking ingredient Glycerin that's very high on the ingredients list. Glycerin creates a soft almost satin feeling texture that can feel moisturizing, however it's actually drawing moisture away from your skin. It also contains dyes and fragrance even though online it claims it doesn't. Maybe the formula changed? I do love the fact this moisturizer is cheap and effective and has Hyaluronic acid, it does work for a lot of people who DON'T have sensitive skin and don't care about ingredients, only outcome.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This moisturizer feels amazing when you apply it! I love the water consistency of it and it doesn't leave my face feeling oily. Occasionally I will get dry patches and this product doesn't really help with my super dry skin. But it's a great daily moisturizer when my skin is more normal! Would buy again as a summer moisturizer,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,After wash face am and pm,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,it works so well. makes your face feel clean and soft.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"this is a good water/gel based moisturizer for acne prone or oily/combination skin, but i do have to say i did not like the fragrance in this moisturizer. it smelled a little bit stronger than i would like it too. but it's good for the summertime or more oilier skin.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I heard great things about this gel moisturizer and finally decided to try it. I got the mini just in case I didn't like it. But I love it! Feels great on my skin and really hydrates. 10/10 would recommend,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Lie down and relax while your skin is deeply hydrated.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"So I've used this for a couple weeks now and I'm not sure this is compatible with my skin. I have oily skin, it's a little sensitive but I don't really breakout much, I don't have acne issues. I mostly wanted something to help with aging as I'm in my late 30s and with my oiliness. But this is actually making my face itch and feel more sensitive. As if I exfoliated too much or something. It also burns as I apply it. I know with any irritation, it's time to stop using the product. I think it's a great gel for oily skin as it doesn't make my face more oily and my makeup sits well on top of it. But I'm too old for itchy face and the possibility of acne. So it's a no for me. If you have acne issues I'd say Neutrogena is a great and affordable for step. But if you don't have acne, this might be too strong and too irritating. I really have to send this back.....fast.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This is the best moisturizer! I feel like my skin is 16 again!!! I'm a plump young chicken! My skin soaks it right up, it doesn't feel heavy, it's light & refreshing. The next morning I can visibly see a difference in hydration in my skin after using this product.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I LOVE this moisturizer. I suffer from rosacea and peri-oral dermatitis and unfortunately for me its very hard to find a good moisturizer. This calms my skin at the same time moisturizes it.,5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have ridiculously sensitive fair skin with rosacea. I hate the feeling of lotion on my skin. I sweat a lot and specially right out of the shower. My skin just doesn't want to absorb lotion and it drives me crazy all sticky and wet for 40+ mins. So I've been trying all the gel and oil moisturizers. This one is the best! You apply is and instantly your skin drinks it. I can put makeup on minutes after i apply it. I use to have to skip moisturizer under makeup because it would just sit on top of my skin. This moisturizer has change my skin healthy and my makeup game! All my makeup looks and applies so smooth now!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This moisturizer is amazing! I used to work for Lanc√¥me and have tried many high-end moisturizers and this one is actually my favorite so far, I've been using it for a few weeks since my Energie de Vie ran out. I have combo skin that gets oily in the summer, but this is lightweight and manages to keep my skin feeling hydrated and supple without being greasy. It smells great too, a very light clean fragrance. I recommend it to everyone now üòä",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This is a great basic moisturizer. I don't like the fragrance. If fragrance doesn't bother you then you should definitely try it! I was kind of dissapointed because it barely lasted me a month. Next time put it in a bigger bottle and I would repurchase.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,So refreshing and moisturizing!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I bought this since I've read such good reviews about this product helping those with dry sensitive skin but soon realized after using it that the next day my skin felt even drier and was flaking!

However, when I did my skincare routine of Clinique cleansers, Clinique toner, Olay facial mist, burt's bees eye cream, a serum, I would finally put on the neutrogena product.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I truly hate this product. I love Neutrogena do I thought it was an easy buy. But the smell alone is nauseating, strong flowery smell.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"The texture to this is light and airy. But I have very sensitive red skin.

It doesn't make dry me out like some gel moisturizers tend to do, i can actually feel when it sinks into my skin and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated. my skin feels better when i use this as opposed to others. also, a little goes a long way. worth the extra money for a drug store brand.",3,,

I was using the gentle cleansing lotion from the hydro boost line which I loved.

Unfortunately, this product is too heavily fragranced and not moisturizing enough for my skin.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"May work well for most people, but if you have sensitive skin be careful. I have very few products I can use on my face, the ingredients for this product looked like something I could use. Took two weeks for my face to recover after only using two days. Recommend putting on small area for awhile if you have over reactive/sensitive skin.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,the face mask is a different texture than a regular one. the face mask is like a jelly feeling. i have sensitive skin and this was perfect. after i let it sit for about 15 mins my skin felt so smooth and looked so pure and hydrated. i'm definitely buying this again.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Worth every penny!!! It actually does have your skin bouncing back like it says in the ads! Incredibly hydrated. At one point this was the only thing in my skincare routine! Will always rebuy and recommend! Great for all skin types (I'm oily and acne prone though I mostly just have hyperpigmentation) and it's REALLY great in winter when you need the extra hydration! The entire hydro boost line is great honestly.,4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I use this twice a day after washing my face. I have very dry skin around my nose and forehead.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"After using one of my cleansers, my skin became extremely dry and bumpy and no lotion or moisturizer made it go away, even after using them for weeks. I bought this, hoping for the best, and I am so pleased. After just one use, my skin was already softer than I think it has ever been. I've been using it for the last few days, and I cannot believe how well it works.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"So I like this moisturizer because it is very light. When you put it on, you can't feel it once it dries... but it sort of flakes and it doesn't work for my skin which is unfortunate because I thought I found a holy grail. But after a couple weeks I got red bumps all around my mouth and I was really confused what was up, but then I realized when I stopped using this stuff the bumps went away. I then gave up and tried a free month of curology and then using their moisturizer made me realize that this moisturizer is just not it.",5,,

I have oily skin, and before using this moisturizer daily, I had an extremely hard time stoping the shine on my face as well as preventing breakouts from all the oils. This is so hydrating that it has trained my skin to not produce so much oil, and I have really clear skin now. I also deal with eczema and haven't had any reoccur on my face since starting to use this. I'm in love with how it absorbs into your skin as if there's nothing there, but still keeps you moisturized. It just feels amazing to apply. The price and amount you get is a bit of a draw back, but when you compare that to how amazing it works, and the higher price of similar products, it's totally worth it. Can't recommend this enough.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Loveeeeee these masks, they are so comfortable and way better than sheet masks in my opinion.",4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I use this twice a day after washing my face. I have very dry skin around my nose and forehead. My makeup used to flake off, and I could never find a moisturizer that would help my skin! This is is. This is my go to!! I have mini ones in my purse and car and the large ones in my bathroom and makeup room!!",2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"After using one of my cleansers, my skin became extremely dry and bumpy and no lotion or moisturizer made it go away, even after using them for weeks. I bought this, hoping for the best, and I am so pleased. After just one use, my skin was already softer than I think it has ever been. I've been using it for the last few days, and I cannot believe how well it works.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"So I like this moisturizer because it is very light. When you put it on, you can't feel it once it dries... but it sort of flakes and it doesn't work for my skin which is unfortunate because I thought I found a holy grail. But after a couple weeks I got red bumps all around my mouth and I was really confused what was up, but then I realized when I stopped using this stuff the bumps went away. I then gave up and tried a free month of curology and then using their moisturizer made me realize that this moisturizer is just not it.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use this as my morning moisturizer and it really has made a difference in my skin after a few uses. It keeps my oil under control most of the day. Smells so fresh and clean. Only wish it had sunscreen so I could skip a step.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have been using this product since my early 20s and thought I found my holy grail. Then for quarantine decided to invest in more high quality products and now this burns like crazy when I put it on. I wonder if it's due to increased exfoliation, but only is burning my face recently and I have no idea why, really upset that this has happened.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I thought I was going to love this because my friend swears by this and has beautiful skin. I thought since I have combo skin this would be good because I'm not too dry or too oily. However, every. single. time. I use this moisturizer I breakout with big under-the-skin pimples. I gave this product many tries because I thought the pimples were caused by something else but I'm certain this is the reason. I hadn't gotten any big pimples on my cheeks for months and the second day I used this one popped up, so I'm pretty positive this is the cause. Definitely super disappointed and will not be using this ever again and would NOT recommend to anyone who thinks they have sensitive skin.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I bought this product a few months ago before Christmas. This product worked so well for my skin. But, overtime it stopped and caused my skin redness and dryness. It made my skin feel stripped. This was a very good product at the START! But, as I used it more it stopped working. I have very sensitive so when I seen it worked for me I was so proud but then it stopped and I found another moisturizer that works well!! But, if you have sensitive skin... you could give it a try... but it may not work for forever!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I REALLY wanted to love this. I saw all the great reviews about this and decided to give it a try. The first time it burnt my skin when I put it on and just figured that it was because my skin was 'extra' dry. After doing some research I found this doesn't have the best ingredients expect for hyaluronic acid. I don't normally have sensitive skin but this just was not for me. Hope this helps someone else with dry skin.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love how moisturized my skin feels after using this product. However, the fragrance is too strong and my skin will react if I use a toner with niacinamide or glycolic acid before using this moisturizer.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I use the cleanser and serum from this line with no issues. But the serum wasn't quite enough for mu dry winter skin, and the bottle suggest following up with this. I started to break out in pimples right away after using this just a few times. I don't have many breakouts, so it was easy to narrow it down. I stopped using it for a bit and my skin cleared right up. Tried it again and had the same results. I can see that the product does have the potential to be a great moisturizer if you get lucky enough to not break out from it. But I can't wear it even once without zits. And I don't typically have any breakouts at all. So unfortunately this was a waste of money for me.",5,,

Because of it's wonderful consistency, it feels so refreshing and it really absorbs quickly, so simply the feeling of putting it on your face is just so nice and doesn't feel gross like putting on a lot of other really heavy moisturizers. It keeps skin feeling pretty nice and moisturized throughout the day without feeling really heavy or greasy. I only wish it was cheaper and gave you more moisturizer in one container.",3,,

I'm sure we've all had an annoying mask that we had to readjust every ten seconds- well this was one of them. I was tired of it after like, 5 minutes, and threw it away. That was a third of the time you're supposed to wear it, and my face didn't feel any different when I took it off. I was definitely not psyched about it.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I used to use this moisturizer and it was the first one I ever found to be effective for my super oily, but somewhat dehydrated, skin. I made it almost the whole way through the jar, but it always gave me a little bit of a tingly sensation, so I decided to discontinue use. Upon further investigation, it unfortunately appears that I have a sensitivity to hyaluronic acid, so I couldn't use this or any of the other products in the line, but it did generally work as a moisturizer for oily skin, so I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who doesn't have ridiculously sensitive skin like me. (BTW, for anyone who does, the replacement I found that worked great for me is the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel. Not the lotion+, not the oil control gel, though that might work great too, haven't tried, and definitely not the hydrating jelly, as that also has hyaluronic acid).",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"The mask hydrates well-if you can get it on and keep it on. The backing was half falling off the mask as I was pulling it out of the package, and the mask was so slippery I had to slide it back up my face until it dried a bit (so it's tacky enough to stick). Neutrogena is very generous with the serum, though. I am frugal so I continued to use leftover serum in the package a few more times the following days. I like to cotton masks better than this slippery gel substance.",5,,

I first bought the little travel size to try it out and just bought the full size. It's super hydrating, you can tell it actually absorbs and doesn't sit on top of the skin. The reason I bought in the first place is because I think gel moisturizers feel way better than creams which run the risk of being greasy even if they're oil free. Becuase of that I believe it would work for every skin type. Since I've incorporated this into my skincare routine my skin in smoother and has a more even tone. It's even healed up a weird flaky dry irritated patch I had near my chin that I couldn't get rid of. This is the holy grail and its not very expensive!! You won't regret this!",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I acknowledge that we all have different skin types. unfortunately for me this product was a nightmare. the product itself was very velvety and smelled decent. However, I had a terrible reaction to it. I broke out in hives, it itched, my face turned red and I got new zits. I used it for 3 days and stopped for a couple of days. My skin still hasn't cleared up and it's so dry to the point it hurts. it has great reviews but it just didn't work for me. I have combination skin. Hopefully my review gives insight of possible side effects. I wish it would have worked out.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This thick sheet mask is awesome. Stays on my face and it comes in two parts - divided half down face. It is fabulous for my super dry skin. After a few back to back day uses, made me break out. So would recommend using every few days, or allow a couple days between uses",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Amazing everything it says it will give it does. I use the Lanc√¥me masks as well and I honestly think I get the same results for a fraction of the cost.,5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I really like this product, it works so well for me. I have combination skin and sometimes really dry once I get out of the shower.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I am obsessed. This is a unique product in the fact that you can control how much moisture you need. You can layer on as much as you'd like without having any build up. It actually keeps your skin moisturized all day with no need to reapply.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This is an amazing dupe for Clinique moisture surge. I feel that this absorbs a lot better than the other moisturizer and has a more cooling effect so it's perfect as a summertime moisturizer and cooling on sunburns as well. Noticeably leaves my skin moisturized and plump and looking very healthy as well can't express how amazing this works,4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This mask is terrible! I love a couple other neutrogena products and figured this would be great, as well.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I love this product except for the scent. Too strong of a fragrance! I use products that are fragrance free as different scents/fragrances bother me.

If I use other products over it the fragrance comes back again strong.,5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I ordered this moisturizer because the winter weather in my area is very unforgiving. On top of this, my apartment has poor air circulation and we use a gas heater, so our air gets very dry. I have a combination skin type. I get patches of dry and oily skin. My boyfriend on the other hand has very dry, sensitive skin. I was looking for a product that we could both use. This product is amazing for both of us. This is my first full day of using it, but I can already tell I love it. It isn't greasy and a little goes a VERY long way. I love this moisturizer because I can tell it's for all day wear. When I first put it on, I didn't feel much of a difference, but throughout the day my face has gotten very soft and supple. My dry patches are gone! My boyfriend said his face hasn't felt this good with a moisturizer in a long time. He has very sensitive skin and he can usually tell right away if something will be irritating because it'll burn. He hasn't burned all day and also feels that it improves throughout the day. When it arrived in the mail, it seemed a little small. I was a little discouraged. But I only needed the tiniest dab to cover my entire face and neck. Same with my boyfriend. Since it's a little pricey we plan to take turns purchasing this product. I love that it fits both of our very different skin types so well!",2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,My brother and I both used this product. He's been using it for years and have very dry skin. He recommended it to me since he likes it so much. He also has sensitive skin but he's never had issues with it. I started using this in the summer because my regular moisturizer was too heavy as I have combination skin that gets oily in the summer.But I quickly realized something was wrong with my skin. Whenever I put the product on the smell was overwhelming and my skin felt irritated and slightly burned. It took me a while to realize this product was causing irritation and my skin wouldn't stop breaking out. Finally stopped using the product and switched back to my old moisturizer and my skin has calmed down significantly.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,There is plenty of serum in the packet but seems most of it stays there instead of sticking to the sheet mask. The mask itself slid around and did not adhere well to my face. I kept it on for the minimum 15 minutes and then applied the remaining serum from the packet 3 times (lots of juice) before finishing my routine. The serum is very light and hydrating with a light scent. It was great for my oily skin but I won't be repurchasing because the mask is too much of a hassle.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Love this mask. It quenches my dry skin and makes it smooth afterwards. A must try mask for everyone to try.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I used to think I had super dry skin, the only reason was because I was using products that stripped my skin of good oils too much. This moisturizer is the only one I've found that doesn't break me out, doesn't leave me with dry patches, and doesn't have an overbearing scent. I tried the knock off version from ELF and got a breakout. Neutrogena did it again sweetie!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This mask fully hydrates and smooths you're skin. Glad to find a mask that does it's job and is so inexpensive. You've got to give this a try.,5,,

I was really struggling to find an affordable moisturizer that worked with my oily, super sensitive skin in a humid climate.....and I found it! It fees soooooo good when you put it on. I used one that was twice as expensive before I found this one and I like this one 10x better. Make up goes over it beautifully too!",4.4,,

As for my skin though, it's hydrating and has helped my oily skin!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I purchased this product because I was in need of a moisturizer and wanted one that was affordable.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I bought this and the serum at the same time, and I noticed how quick it absorbs into the skin. At first I thought it was great because I hate that sticky feeling while you wait for things to sink in. However, I noticed how matte my face would look afterwards and it still feels a bit tight and dry. After about a week, I've noticed these tiny whiteheads that are popping up near my nose and mouth, and I don't breakout there or have these particular breakouts. At first i thought it was the fragrance, because the product is HEAVILY fragranced. As I got to looking at the ingredients, and one of the biggest/highest ingredients is dimethicone! I really wished this worked for me, but with the fragrance, dimethicone, breakouts, and not moisturizing, I just cant recommend this.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This mask is wonderful. Does everything it claims to do. But the WORK i have to put in tp get this mask on is kind of annoying only because its a 2 piecer and if your not Careful the serum that saturates the mask will drip out immediately. ( i like to save the extra to rub in after) this is not a multitasking mask and what i mean is you cant be walking around doing whatever else with this on because it will slip and move. So i suggest if you have the extra 10-15 minutes to just lay down and relax while waiting for this to work its magic then go for it ! But if your looking for something you can quickly slap on and move on then this isnt the one .,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I am someone who takes pride in my skincare. I read ingredients and educate myself on best practices. I invest in my skincare, but the most expensive isn't aways the best and, likewise, the most affordable isn't bad in and of itself. The latter couldn't be more true with these Hydro Boost Hydrating Hydrogel Masks. They are easily comparable to more expensive masks on the market. They out-perform some of their higher priced competitors with accessibility, comfort, size, and ingredients. I've been using these after going in hard with a new retinoid and they are soothing and hydrating. Make sure to follow with a moisturizer!",1,,

Leaves the skin hydrated and happy!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"My skin is fairly dry and some products will dry me out, but not often. I used this and not only did it break me out, it dried my skin out SO terribly. I had flakes and patches.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have sensitive skin, so naturally I'm a little cautious about what I put on my face, but this moisturizer is one I will use again and would recommend! Feels like heaven going on and leaves the face totally hydrated. Not harsh at all and smells pleasant. Leaves my face feeling fresh the rest of the day!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Love this product. I've used the hydro boost gel before and loved it. Needed a last minute face mask tonight and saw this and picked it up. So glad I did. I love the gel consistency of the mask. Will buy again,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use this product morning and night! I've gone through so many containers already. It's moisturizing and refreshing. This is perfect for oily skin since it's gel-based.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Smells so good,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I recommend this for any one dealing with dry skin and need help getting it alive and refresh again. iv personally have had dry skin my whole life and has tried everything that seems to fail it either makes my skin oily or causes my skin to burn. BUT THIS RIGHT HERE. Neutrogena hydro boost gel and every hydro boost product ! this will help your skin feel refresh again. honestly every hydro product iv bought has yet to disappoint me. Each product you only need a little. because a little goes a long way. it keeps your face feeling hydrated for 12 hrs plus. I honestly never loved a product so much . it's worth the money and I'm glad I bought it. now i can feel confident buying makeup again without feeling like my skin is gonna soak it up.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use this product in the morning. Makes my face feel refreshed.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Before I open it or read the instructions in the back and it says to use the white part as a guide but everything is stuck together so it's really difficult to know how it goes on your face. I assumed the weird extra patch goes on the outside Incase you want to close your eyes. It's good for it's price it does hydrate!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have sensitive skin but I loved this mask. My face isn't irritated and feels super hydrated right now. Extra serum to keep and use for another day. If does have two separate parts but not hard to figure it out. Definitely will use again especially for the price.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have oily skin, and I've tried many high end moisturizers and nothing worked. A friend referred this product, so I decided to give it a shot. Not only does this product leave your face feeling refreshed without the oily feeling, it also brightens and clears acne! I use this twice a day after I clean my face, and I can not believe the results!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Love how it goes on. Does not last even when used with other Neutrogena products. Tried using along with Wrinkle Expert day/night moisturizer and is a little better.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This moisturizer is very cooling and hydrating. I have normal to oily skin and it gives the perfect amount of hydration. It does not clog my pores at all. Definitely recommend!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Skin actually felt dry after using it. I returned it.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I usually place my moisturizer in the fridge, that way when I use it, it's super cold and refreshing on my face!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This stuff is amazing,4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,It moisturizes without feeling heavy.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Not sure why this is marketed for dry skin because it's not hydrating. It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling tight no matter how much I apply. I also think it's breaking me out probably because my skin is trying to compensate for the lack of moisture. The only positive is that this didn't cause any irritation for my mildly sensitive skin. I feel like this product would only be good for oily skin if anything. Will be returning.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have dry/combo skin and this really didn't do anything. Didn't really hydrate or make my skin feel nice. Only reason i am giving it two stars is because it smells nice.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This product is super light and airy once you blend it in your face. It just melts into your face, and it smells clean and fresh!!!! It does have a leftover residue, but I just blend it in into my hands and wrist!",4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"It smells wonderful, is hydrating without being greasy, and seems to be working well so far!",2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've seen people say they got a reaction from this product which is definitely valid, it is not for sensitive skin. but if you have dry skin this product is amazing. dont expect any long term results, this mask is just packed with hyaluronic acid and will make your skin feel hydrated, refreshed, and plump for 8-12 hours. I use it in the AM when I wanna go without makeup and I love how it feels all day after. definitely recommend!!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Love it.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This mask provided MUCH needed hydration to my very very dry skin! Recommend!!!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I love it!!!! It feels so cold and fresh,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This was recommended to me since I have really dry skin. I was hoping it would work but this product caused me to breakout horribly. Will not be using the rest of it.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I purchased this due to all the great reviews and I totally agree! This moisturizer is super light weight, absorbs fast and is really moisturizing! Not thick at all, your sin is left feeling suple and smooth! I would recommend giving this a try.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have used this mask once. Still too early to truly evaluate effectiveness. The first application was nice however skin did not feel as moisturized or awakened as it has with other products. Will definitely try a few more times.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have extremely oily skin and could never find a moisturizer that didn't make my skin tacky and slick. I tried this and it's my favorite. It moisturizes just enough but not so much that my makeup skids off within the hour. I could see how this wouldn't be enough for someone with dry or combination skin, but for someone whose skin never seems to dry out, it's a lifesaver.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I bought this out of recommendation from a dermatologist.... yikes. The instant I put it on my face, my skin dried out. I didn't think anything of it. I thought it absorbed nicely. Until I started to feel my skin and it was covered in bumps. I thought it was my face wash, so stupidly, I tried to add a little more... cue the actual visible sight of redness and bumps breaking out across my skin. I had to cleanse and remove the lotion, and find another moisturizer for it to finally calm down. While this doesn't have many ingredients, I've never had an allergic reaction to a skincare item, and this did NOT sit well with me. Be very aware of the ingredients that are in here, and approach with caution. Definitely patch test before you indulge, unlike me, who went all in, and my skin is still bumpy. :(",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have long nails so it was little hard getting it out since it was slimy but overall the experience was wonderful, my face looked radiant and supple after wearing for about 30min. I'll for sure going to buy more.",4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This product spreads easily on my skin and it doesn't look oily and it doesn't have that greasy feel like a cream does.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I love this product! It's so nice and makes my skin feel hydrated. What isn't making this 5 stars is it isn't very long-lasting :/,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This product feels so amazing, the longer you leave it on the more hydrated your skin feels!!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love this mask as a pick me up to refresh and hydrate my skin. This mask has a very interesting jelly texture and feels great when applied, I'm not that amused at the fact that it has two separate pieces, as you have to figure out placing for these masks to stay on without falling off. I'm not a big fan of heavily scented face products this particular one isn't as strong as any of the other hydro boost products. I love putting it in the refrigerator for 10 mins prior to use. I like to use this mask in the morning but does work very well at night layered with thicker night creams. These masks have a lot of extra serum if want to get more bang for your buck you can pour the leftover product into an empty serum bottle and use a couple more times. I highly recommend the purifying and brightening masks in this same line.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"It felt good on the skin and was definitely moisturizing but made me break out... I do love the body lotion they make, but it's kind of concerning they have the same fragrance.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I would love this product more if it didn't contain dimethicone. It can clog pores especially with acne prone/oily skin. And i do have that problem, but the hyaluronic acid really does moisturize the skin.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This makes my skin feel so good. I get dry patches and this helps get rid of them literally over night. I was a littler concerned about it being a gel texture but it's great. I also love the way it smells. I have sensitive skin but I didn't have any issues with this product.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've recently been using the Clinique 72 hour moisture surge, and I heard this product was a dupe. Once I ran out, I purchased the hydro Boost water gel and regretted it soon after. I should've tried the hydro Boost cream instead. Unlike the cream, the water gel has fragrance in it which in my opinion completely ruins this product. I have sensitive skin. Sometimes, this product will cause my skin to burn but that's mostly only when it's been going through the gigs (wind burn, sun damage, dentist appointment lol). Anyways, I can never use this moisturizer alone as it doesn't give me enough moisture. That really sucks because this moisturizer isn't cheap. Either way, I will give the hydro Boost cream a shot once I run out of this tub. This product does have some positives and could be really nice if you have oily skin. I am very acne prone and this didn't break me out. It is super lightweight and not greasy. Additionally, it does a really great job at smoothing texture thanks to dimethicone which isn't the awful ingredient that some people make it out to be. It's actually beneficial but can create the illusion of more moisturized skin.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've tried numerous facial creams and always experienced problems no matter what brand I used. This water gel is different. I LOVE that this is a gel and not a cream. It soaks in quickly and doesn't feel like you rubbed lotion on your face. My combination skin feels even and looks and feels very hydrated. No burning, no tingling, no redness, no discomfort in any way. This is, by far, the best facial moisturizer I've used to this day. Highly recommend.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I asked an Ulta employee for an affordable face moisturizer that actually works. She showed Me this one and I love it. This is my first ""offical"" moisturized. I definitely recommend this one if you're on the hunt for one.",1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love neutrogena and I was curious to try out this product. My skin is normal, no acne, not oily or dry, but when I tried this product out I noticed it would cause redness in my skin and tiny little red bumps. I'm not sure what in the product caused this but i had to throw out the whole collection I had bought. (Gel cleanser, moisturizer, and face mist) it did hydrate my skin a bit but it wasn't worth the redness and bumps I got from it.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This is a beautiful product. I have chronic dry and red skin and this product heals it. It's a life saver! Expensive but worth it!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have oily to combination skin, and I have cystic acne. I have struggled for YEARS to find a moisturizer that actually works and won't break out my skin, or make it more oily. Using this, has helped my skin so much, because it hydrates my skin and doesn't break me out, and it isn't oily. Many complain about the scent of it, but it isn't bad. It almost smells kind of tropical or like some type of detergent- I don't really know how to describe it. The texture feels kind of like a primer, so it's not super creamy like other moisturizers, but it is not heavy at all!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I use the SPF version as a daytime application and the extra dry version for evening application. I actually woke up and my skin was dramatically less oily. At the end of the day, my skin was less oily too causing my foundation to wear better. So far it has been working great! Worth the money!",1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have combination type of skin, oily on my T zone and very dry on the sides of my mouth and cheeks, so dry it peals off and when I apply make up never looks smooth. That was bothering me a lot! Until I tried this. Absorbs super fast, does not clog your pores, doesn't leave your face sticky of oily.",1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have dermatitis and this is the only moisturizer that keeps it in check without breaking me out. I love this one and the cream gel!,4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,My face& neck had gotten sunburned.My skin was itching & peeling. I was using Aloe. The Neutrogena gel moisturizer added moisture without feeling greasy. Soothed & calmed my skin.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,The water gel works great -until it starts to evaporate and you notice half of your product is gone,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Very hydrating!! Great for dry skin!!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,i have been using this product for awhile now and it's not bad but I decided to switch brands because i recently found out that this brand tests on animals. Too bad because i would have repurchased...,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I've been using this every night after cleansing my face and it's absolutely amazing! Makes my face feel hydrated and soft! Would definitely repurchase!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"the only moisturizer out there that doesn't break me out. a holy grail for me. i use it every time i wash my face (after) and i can tell immediately that my pores look smaller and my skin is SO much softer. i have very oily skin but also have a couple intense dry patches and this product does the trick. 100% RECOMMEND! if you read this review and thought, ""this sounds like me/my situation"" don't hesitate to buy!!!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Makes my skin feel great without making it more oily. Honestly has helped my acne a lot. Now this is my 100% go to moisturizer for a makeup day or no makeup day. I use it in the morning and at night after washing my face.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have very dry skin year round. I use this product when my skin is feeling dry and also before my makeup. It works wonders for me. The mask has some texture to it so it doesn't fall off. I leave it on until dry for maximum use.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"ok I tried so many brands of moisturizer and they all broke me out or gave me some kind of problem. This stuff was worth the hype. It makes my skin feel so nice, I apply it in the morning and before bed after washing my face. If you're sensitive to heavier creams I suggest you give this a try.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love how lightweight this product is. It's not greasy, and it smells great! A little goes a long way, too- just a little tap of a fingertip is enough for my whole face! Will definitely buy again!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I use in the morning under makeup during the summer months. Doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. I wish it was just a tad more moisturizing, will try the gel for extra dry skin next to see if I like it better.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I use to avoid moisturizer all together, simply because I hated the heavy, oily feeling it left behind. Then I found this! And I realized that I was just not using the right moisturizer for me! I love how light this feel and how grease-free it is. I honestly look forward to moisturizing now! Overall, my makeup is sitting so much better on my face after some incredible hydration. 100% recommend for combination dry-oily skin.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I made a review but why ulta hasn't posted it. BUT ANYWAYS, PLEASE DONT BUY THIS. THIS PRODUCT ITS PURE SILICONE!! READ INGREDIENTS IT HAS ALOT OF DIMETHICONE WHICH IS SILICONE",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I bought the cleanser and this water gel because the reviews convinced me but please do yourself a favor and save your money. My skin is combination, oily on the t-zone and the rest is very dry. I put it on the dry spots clearly because it's to hydrate and it soon enough began to burn my face, I'm guessing because of the strong mfn fragrance it has. After I took it off my face it turned red. Don't buy this, save your money.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This mask broke me out with itchy skin almost immediately! I thought the tingle was the mask working but it was my skin becoming irritated. So disappointed because my skin was in great condition before this. Do not recommend this mask.,2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I am 60+ and this hydrates my skin without being greasy. Makes fine lines vanish! I have tried many moisturizers, but this one is awesome!!!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I wish it had more in it but all moisturizers are like that,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I want to start by saying, Neutrogena, please never change anything about this product. For me, as an extremely oily, dehydrated, sensitive, acne prone gal I struggle to find products that work for my skin. I'm Korean so I naturally always gravitate towards k and j beauty products. They work better for my skin. Over the last few years I've struggled with cystic acne so I have to be really careful with what I put on my skin. I try to look for non-comedogenic products to avoid further breakouts. I read a really great review on this product from an article I found on pinterest after searching best products for my skin type. The reviewer's review really checked all the boxes off my list for what I was looking for so I reached for this right away. I was so pleased after trying this. Experienced no breakouts, pore blurring results and sat super well under make-up. I never had any issues with dryness and felt this product plumped up areas like smile lines. I'm always on the hunt for something better with everything I use, so I'll try something different for a bit but I keep finding myself coming back to this product. I've tried really expensive to not so expensive moisturizers trying to find that HG, but I honestly think this product may be that for me. I've been using it for 3 years now and once I leave, I always come back to it. This is the one moisturizer I've repurchased the most because I love it that much. It really stinks to read it hasn't worked for other folx, but as someone who struggles with most products, I really hope Neutrogena doesn't change anything about this one and I hope those can find something that works for them too. If you're on the fence of trying it, I'd say give it a whirl.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have super dry skin,dry patches from on my cheeks.I've tried many high brand moisterizers and they never did the job. until I finally decided to try this. its amazing! I recommend for people with dry skin it makes it so soft and perfect to put under makeup.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,A little goes a long way with this moisturizer. It doesn't leave any residue or greasy feeling on my face. It absorbs well into my skin so I don't have any small flakes left on my skin like with some other moisturizers I have tried.,2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I'm so sad to see people not like this product! I have very sensitive skin that downright just sucks! It is oily/acne prone, but super sensitive so I never know what I can and can't use. I have been using this in the am and pm now for months! Even under my makeup it is perfect. It is not greasy and my skin feels so soft. I put this on in the morning before my primer and it is perfect! In the evening I do my night routine and put this on to sleep and perfect! The one thing that I will say is that I'm very disappointed in the way that the other products in this line work. I purchased the water gel with the sunscreen added and it was HORRIBLE! I also purchased the city shield and had terrible results. I suppose it depends on each person and their skin. I did love this product enough to try and get the whole line, but this is the only thing I've found that I can stick to and actually works amazing. I can't go without it!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I like this moisturizer and I've only been using it for a short amount of time. It has made a difference in the presence of dry skin. Love!!!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have a problem with dry skin. I used to wear foundation and see that my skin was peeling underneath. After every shower and face wash, I use this and my face feels sooooo smooth. A little goes a long way. If you put too much you can actually feel it on your skin but with the right amount you can't feel it. Now that I use this, I don't see anymore peeling underneath my foundation.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This broke me out so bad and I've never experienced a product breaking me out. After a week and half of use I noticed all these little tiny bumps on my cheeks that looked like white heads or something and I put a face mask on and it made them stand out SO MUCH they looked huge and my pores were HUGE I was so scared because tbh I have clear skin and get minimal pimples so this was new and I knew it was this moisturizer because it was the only thing I changed from my skin routine and I wasn't on my period. This wasn't for me I guess even though to heard it was great I'll pass.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Its very cool to the touch and lightweight on your face! Definitely love it. I will definitely buy it again. And ive got tons of products in my bathroom but this one is one of my favs. Doesnt break my fave out or make it feel oily. I was skeptical at first because nothing seems to help but this one is fantastic. I now own all of the neutrogena city shield and hydro boost creams and serums,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Amazing. I've used the Hydro Boost gel sheet mask on a regular basis before purchasing this, so I knew what to expect for the smell, which doesn't bother me at all. The product melts right into your skin, leaving a smooth, natural finish. I originally purchased the trial size, but once it's gone I will be buying the normal size.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This product is SUPER hydrating but I noticed when I use it I get small pimples in the middle of my forehead.

I was prepared to spend more (and I have) but though ti would give this one a try and it was fabulous! I have been telling everyone about it.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have oily/combination skin.

But that one is around 40 dollars which was a lot for me to spend on a moisturizer so I decided to try this one and wow I love this one. It's almost better than the tarte on 10/10 recommend!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have bought this product around 5 times, I love it so much. I have dry skin especially on my forehead and use it at night and it makes my face feel so moisturized and smooth.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I am in my early 30s and have been struggling with my under eye appearance (looked dull and lacked elasticity). I purchased both the moisturizer and eye cream (Hydro-Lift) and OMG....the skin under my eyes no longer sink in and look so supple and hydrated!! I absolutely love this product and can't wait to go back to the store to purchase additional Hydro-Boost products!!!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I feel like this is trying to be a dupe for a popular water sleeping mask of a similar color and scent, but it misses the mark. Instead of smelling light and fresh, it smells strongly like a bathroom air freshener. If you have sensitive skin or are bothered by fragrance, stay away from this product! I could maybe forgive the overuse of fragrance if it worked well, but it's honestly too lightweight for my skin type and feels slightly drying. This may be better for oily skin types, but my dry/dehydrated people should probably look elsewhere. Not worth it, especially for the price.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I already used the daily cleaner and daily moisturizer in the skin care line and while waiting to check out at the dollar store I found the mask. That's right folks not a high end, over priced pharmacy or department store but a good old affordable dollar store. Sittung at home one afternoon decided to try it , did not even use mirror to get it on perfectly. Kept it on for 25 min. and the refreshing, healthy , youthful glow after use can't be missed.",2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have severe dry skin. No matter what I use it seems like it is never ending. I've used this mask several times now to make sure it truly works and it does. My skin feels so much better after using this. The mask is somewhat like a gel that has a ribbed side to help keep it on your face. I leave it on until it is dry. My skin is so smooth and luscious for days. Great product.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I love this moisturizer! It really does plump up your skin making it feel soft and supple. I use it in the morning under my foundation and it also makes a good primer. In my opinion it's a lot of bang for your buck!,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I've been a long time neutrogena fan and this does not disappoint. It feels amazing on your skin and really does plump it up. My skin feels soft and supple. It's also a great primer for your moisturizer. I think it's a lot of bang for your buck!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,My skin is on the dry side but this just made it worse.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Love this product! I have always had a breakout-prone/oily nose and chin, and dry cheeks. So hard to get something that works! I have tried all sorts of moisturizers but none felt light enough nor helped me with the zits. My chin kept constantly breaking out. I got good results with SOS Caudalie Serum, but Neutrogena water gel is half the price and does the same thing. I have ditched all other moisturizers. I only cleanse my face morning and night and use the Neutrogena water gel at night. My skin is very smooth, bright, dewy and suddenly, after a few weeks of this routine, my chin is CLEAR! For the the first time ever. Yes, I recommend!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,great for everyday use! light weight and feels great on the skin.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Had high hopes for this product, however it has broken my skin so terribly. I regret buying this completely and I have great skin but my concern is the dryness. Around the 4th-5th day of using this I woke up to a burning red face with a prickly rash all over my forehead, cheeks, chin, everywhere. My skin looks CHEMICALLY burned. My cheeks are burned to the touch and the rash all over my forehead is disgusting. After doing a lot of review reading I learned I wasn't the only one with this reaction. Please don't take the burning sensation as ""it doing it's job"" on the first tries. I will never go back to this product, and will stay away from Neutrogena forever.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This mask is amazing!!! I have pretty normal skin but lately it's been a bit dryer. I tried this mask out and my skin felt soooo hydrated and refreshed after! It made my complexion look so youthful. I read reviews that it was messy to do so I prepared myself, but when I put it on it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I mean ofcourse it's going to be a little messy because of all the product on the mask but I think it's so worth it! Will be buying these again and again.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"So my skin was always normal and I never had to do anything to it. All of a sudden my face is dry and patchy... I did my research on what to do and how to fix it on a budget. If I'm going to be using this every day, it will obviously need to be repurchased somewhat often. I tried Dove first (did absolutely nothing) so then I found this... I am OBSESSED. It actually cleared my breakouts on my chin somehow. My face is SO smooth and I feel like I did before my skin got bad! Yes, the smell is strong, but I don't think it's a bad smell. I actually like it. This has quickly become my absolute favorite.",4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,i have been using this product for quite a while. I have combination skin which makes it hard to find the right moisturizer because sometimes it feels like it makes my skin oily. The Neutrogena hydroboost Water Gel is perfect for my skin because it Is water-based making my skin moisturized and not oily. For quite a while I struggled with finding the right moisturizer but then decided to try this one and it is my favorite one and I've ever tried.,3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Gave this product a try after hearing great things. I have oily acne prone skin and I didn't think it did a lot in terms of moisturizing my face. It didn't make it oily which I guess is a plus but I like other brands much better. Wouldn't buy again,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I started getting terrible cystic acne & bumps all over my face 4 months ago. I tried tons of different moisturizers, acne spot treatments, cleansers, lasers, literally anything you can think of (it ended up being my birth control IUD causing the breakouts) But during all of this trial & error I discovered this GEM! This moisturizer is incredible. I have very sensitive skin, & this didn't irritate or clog my pores. I would compare it to the Clinique Moisture Surge, but much more affordable! I'm in love",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I bought the trial size jar to see if it works for my dry face after buying a big jar of Bliss. A little bit goes a long way and it does make my face soft but it made my face dry. It really didn't do anything to help the dryness I felt on my face. Bliss did the same thing. It made my face feel dry. I won't be purchasing this again. I really didn't see any difference after using it for a month.,5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I use this while my skin is still damp and let it soak in. Once it's dried down I add my spf and moisturizer. My skin is changed. Its amazing! I had horrendous problems with an oily t-zone. After a week or two of hydrating my skin, my t-zone is under control. I'm in love with this product and have purchased back up upon back up.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Great product. I have combination skin and it truly hydrated.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have normal with sometimes combination skin while traveling and go through a lot of moisturizers and creams. This is the absolute worst I've ever tried. I ended up with red bumps and rough, dry patches after the first use. It absorbed quickly, to a satin finish that left my skin still feeling dry. I re-applied after an hour - still too dry. The next day I tried again and even my husband commented my skin was red and asked if I was feeling well. I tested some on his face and the same thing happened - dry, rough patches except his were also itchy. Rinsed it off and our skin felt better plain, without it. Everyone raving about this product was from years ago with many new reviews reporting the same reaction. I'm thinking the formula has changed? I can't recommend against this enough.",1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I enjoy using this product as a quick moisturizer after cleaning my face. Lightweight and a little goes a long way,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Wouldn't it be nice if just one skin care company would use a model who actually had wrinkles when advertising how their cream will eliminate wrinkles,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I am a huge K beauty brand lover, and started with those, so maybe I'm more used to the way your skin feels after a mask like Tony Moly type mask. But my sister absolutely raves about these, so I decided to give them a shot! It's..... ok. Not my favorite. It didn't do anything bad to my skin, but nothing stellar either. I loved the way they felt, super relaxing gel that makes you feel like your in a spa with cucumbers on your eyes. I have dry skin, but not overly dry. But after the 15 minutes, I took it off and my skin IMMEDIATELY dried, I could almost feel the moisture flying off my face! I still had to moisturize after, which I usually do, but usually I have a lot more serum left on and feel super plump. I feel like this would be a good mask for normal/oily skin as a serum mask, to treat/add something to your routine, and moisturize after. But for dry skin, it's reallyyyyyyy not my favorite at all.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I use Drunk Elephant Baby Facial without issue. I use their retinol with almost no transition period (like two dry patches for a day). But this, THIS is what makes my face tingle in a precursor to worse. Not sure why, but it's enough to make me weary. I'm using it on my body and keeping an eye on it but it's just enough to make me weary and I won't rebuy.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Will buy this product again and again because it is the best. Smells great, applies smoothly, instant hydration and skin becomes super soft. Love it! Doesn't leave my feeling oily at all as I'm an oily girl. Where has this product been all my life!?",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"The Neutrogeno Hydro Boost Gel works well for people with oily to normal skin. The product is not too heavy and does not have a greasy consistency. This product worked great over the summer with higher humidity levels, but did not work as well in the dryer conditions of winter. I still use the product in the winter, but I have to use it twice daily in comparison to only using it once a day over summer.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"My skin has been becoming really dry and I heard great things about this product. I hardly ever get acne besides the occasional pimple or two that I was trying to get rid of but accidentally dried out too much, so I thought this was just the hydration I needed to help them. I put a ton of this lotion on the areas and within two days there were over double of pimples all in that area. My face is also itchy, and becoming red. In the morning when I went to put on my makeup, it actually flaked off of my face as well which was so weird. Would NOT recommend",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This absorbs so well and quickly. Doesn't leave behind a sticky residue. I use it under my makeup.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I usually can't stand how sheet mask are always too big and bunch up and never fit right. This one is split in two, so it is much easier to lay it right on your face. It is very refreshing, will be repurchasing!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have combo skin with my cheeks needing moisturization versus my oily T-zone. As I've gotten older (late 30s) my skin has become more sensitive.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have dry slightly sensitive skin. Bought this and loved the texture and felt as though it would work great. I used it consistently for a week and each day more and more little bumps grew on my face . By the end of the week my face was COVERED in red rashy bumps. I threw it away. One month later the bumps have finally disappeared but it took a MONTH.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I started using this moisturizer a few weeks ago and have noticed a huge difference in my skin.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I got this to try replace the Clinique Moisture Surge because obviously this much nicer on the wallet. It does a very good job at moisturizing. I do like the way it feels when on BUT this stuff CLOGS MY PORES! It give me the BIGGEST blackheads of my life! My nose has large pores and I get blackheads on a daily basis but the SIZE & darkness of these blckheads is crazy! It looks like somebody dotted me with an ink pen. I even get huge blackheads on my cheeks from this which I don't typically have blackheads on my cheeks. Unfortunately I just can't use it anymore. I don't know if I would recommend it or not because everyone is different. I guess I would since it does it's job.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This stuff works to a point. I have extremely dry skin, so I decided to try this. I really didn't want to pay the higher end prices of Clinique,IT, Murad, and etc.. it works to hydrate all of my skin except my t zone. I have to apply several layers because it just soaks into my skin immediately . I feel like there's not much product I'm there for that, so it runs out quickly. I'll use this until I can find something better. It's okay, but I wouldn't recommend for extremely dry skin. It works great as a lighter moisturizer. Bonus is it never made me breakout",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"After trying many different products, both drugstore and prestige brands, this is the only product to make a dent in my skin problems. The surface of my skin is very dry, but it gets oily throughout the day, so for me this moisturizer is the holy grail. It's not oily or tacky but keeps me moisturized. It's like giving my skin a drink of water.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have a combination skin. This works amazing for me. I love that it's lightweight and absorbs instantly and leaves my skin smooth and not greasy.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I wish I read the reviews more before I bought this product. If you have even slightly sensitive skin I would not suggest buying this. I think this product is super hydrating and the texture is great, however for skin like mine, the product burned :(",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This dehydrated my face SO much in just two days. I have oily skin that gets dry spots of not properly moisturized (But I don't have combo skin). I threw it out and it was honestly a waste of money to me.,4.4,,

Will definitely be purchasing again when needed.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have dry/combo skin. I am currently using a topical prescription acne product that left me with dry patched on my chin and cheeks.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I buy this product all the time. I use it before I apply my moisturizer,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I tried this product because people were raving about it. I was using a moisturizer that was greasy and left my skin feeling heavy. This product does not give me that feeling and using it prior to makeup has been wonderful. I must say though it doesn't seem to be the most moisturizing product I have ever used. Thankfully my skin isn't extremely dry so,so far so good!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have had a hard time finding a face lotion that doesn't clog my pores or make me break out and this is PERFECT for that!!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This moisturizer is great. I've spent years trying out all different kinds of moisturizers and until now I haven't found one that would moisturize my face without giving me breakouts. I've been increasingly prone to breakouts as I age, but I also want to make sure I use something to keep my skin from over-drying and getting wrinkles! With this, my skin feels and looks soft and well-hydrated without being greasy or feeling like I've got an extra layer on top of it.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I love this. It moisturizes so great. My skin is dry to combination.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This is the only moisturizer that has made my skin so soft and not make me greasy. The smell is so light and nice. By far my favorite part of my skin care routine now!!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin and my skin feels very moisturized without clogging my pores. It's a great product, I use it in the mornings and after I get out of the shower. It's a great dupe for the Clinique",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love the consistency and hydration of the moisturizer. It is a very effective moisturizer, however the gel medium makes me wish the product had longer hydrating effects. So my skin still felt fresh hours later",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love this sheet mask! I apply after washing and toning, then follow it with a moisturizer and it makes my skin so soft and hydrated. The essence from the mask is also easy to massage into your skin and doesn't get everywhere",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I currently have it on while writing the review. Im noticing a cooling feeling which burns stings a little... i usually dont buy otc products. But i needed something deaperately My first inital thought! Packaging could be better.. for the ladies having problem putting this on, you want lip and eye flaps facing outwards, the textured part of the mask on your skin. U just slide your finger across to make it stick!! The mask get tacky as the produxt absorbs into your skin",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Great product!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Stung my eyes and burned my skin.,5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Maybe it's my picky/sensitive skin type, but it broke me out with acne. It feels amazing, very refreshing and moisturizing; unfortunately it made my face red and clogged my pores after a week. Good luck to anyone who tries this. Btw- my skin is weird. Dry after I wash it (every soap I've tried, highend-drugstore), and mildly oily after a long day.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Okay I never ever leave reviews because I'm very lazy lol but I had to leave one for this, I've been using this after I use the cleanser everyday and I must say my skin is like extra plump and squishy (in a good way) it's made my face super smooth. I have very sensitive skin like to the point where I get shots every Tuesday for it, and this didn't break me out and it's just amazing I wish it was a tiny bit cheaper tbh though",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,It was just okay. It didn't really do anything good for my skin but also didn't do anything bad. I would of liked it if the packaging was better. Once you open it everything slides off including the white film. Because of that I didn't know what was the part that goes on your face . Then it's split in two. So the top part was stuck to the bottom. I understand the concept of why they split the mask. But maybe out a divider in the packaging. Like the tonymoly strawberry nose strips. Or even just made it a full mask. It was it's to much of a hassle to put on. Then it had the mouth and eye flaps. Those where awkward as well and made it even more difficult to put on. I don't think I'll buy this again. I'll try the over night gel mask instead. It was just to much of a hassle to put on,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This works great in my sensitive skin. I use it every night and my skin feels smooth in the mornings. Highly recommend!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"A friend recommended me this moisturizer 2 years ago, time passed by and never bought it, she gave it to me for Christmas and I absolutely love it! It leaves the skin soft (like baby skin) and gives you the energy boost for a good looking face! I think it's a very good mostiourizer and affordable. But everyone has different types of skin so I recommend to ask a specialist before buying it, mine is normal kind of oily sometimes and fitted pretty well!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have SUPER sensitive skin and was hesitant about trying this product but kept hearing great things about it! It makes my skin feel super hydrated and refreshed. It does have a light fragrance but doesn't bother my skin, surprisingly! I'd recommend this product! Definitely better than Clinique moisture surge for me.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This moisturizes my dry spots right away and absorbs quickly into the skin. It has never made me break out, and I have naturally oily skin",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Love! So great for winter dry skin,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I was so excited when I saw this product as I have always used neutrogena and liked them. I've trusted them to be good, safe products since they market themselves as such. I didn't know as much about ingredients at the time and didn't think to look (my fault) as I have always trusted neutrogena. But I'm using this on my arms to get worth out of it because I can't stand the smell and I don't want to use fragrance and dyes on my face, especially in my skincare. They are only there for aesthetic and I think the jar is good enough (I love the jar design). Why do we need to dye something to convince people it feels like water? I feel like I wasted my money on this product and I can't wait to finish it. Also I put it on 20 minutes ago and I can still smell it. Ugh...",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I absolutely love this product and will NEVER use anything else!!! I have very oily skin and during the winter it tends to dry out ALOT, which it just started doing this within the past two years. I ran out last summer and tried a countless number of different moisturizers. Nothing compared to this one. I learned my lesson and will never use another product!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"The best spf face lotion I've ever used. Never oily, have never gotten a sunburn while using it, and have also never broken out",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"i finally got this after running out of my old moisturizer (clinique moisture surge) and i have to say i like it a lot more. i have combination skin that tends towards oily and i find that products with hyaluronic acid really help. this product keeps my skin moisturized without making it greasy. it also does a nice job of sinking into the skin and not leaving it sticky like the clinique did. this does have frangrance in it, which i'm not crazy about, but i haven't noticed any ill effects yet, and i actually quite like the scent. it's very fresh and clean.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I LOVE this stuff! I use it twice a day, every day. It has become such a staple product in my routine, and I have noticed a dramatic difference in my skin. My skin is love elastic and smooth. My lines are less visible and my redness has decreased. My skin retains its hydration so much better when I use this continuously. Highly recommend!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have psoriasis, and the doctor tried to give me some expensive moisturizer so i bought this and It cleared me all up!!! Love it‚ù§Ô∏è",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Seriously THE BEST I have extremely weird dry skin love to exfoliate then slap this puppy on and my skin is in heaven !,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have been using this water gel for over a year now and have noticed results from the very first day I used it. It makes your skin plump, soft, and a healthy look to it. 10 out of 10 recommend this for even oily skin it's a miracle I have found a moisturizer that works for all skin types!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I tried it but I had know idea which side was the correct way! Didn't see much happening. It reminded me a lot of the gel face moisturizer they sell. I will try it again since I bought a couple and I'll update this review!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Best face mask. If your skin can get super dry like mine, this is for you. I am always hesitant to try drug store brands but this is amazing. I usually would drop alot of money at ""the other store"" for a product like this. It helped my skin while I was home visiting in Ohio in the winter. This mask makes me face feel so soft right after I use it. For the price you cant go wrong.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Like it!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This project dried my face around my t zone and month area,4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have combination skin. This will not moisturize a lot. I think this would be perfect for people with only oily skin. If you have dry skin you will still feel dry after applying it. Feels good when you first apply it though.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"i received this product in a sample bag and tried it out when the weather turned colder. So far, it has been excellent for my sensitive combination skin and I just purchased the full size product because I enjoyed it so much. A little goes a long way and my skin feels hydrated without the greasiness or breakouts. Even my brow expert at Ulta's Benefit Brow Bar noticed the difference in my skin during my last brow wax! The only thing (and it's a nitpicky thing at that) is that I wish I was packaged in a bottle versus a pot because I feel it would help me control how much I use and prevent wasting product. Otherwise I love it and will plan to repurchase!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I really love this mask!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Really like this product! My teenagers even get into it! U used Chanel hydra for several winters but gave this product a shot two years ago. Hooked!,2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have tried multiple sheet masks but this has to top all the ones I have tried before, my skin is dry and this mask leaves my skin glowing after use!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This feels great going on and my breakout prone kids with oily dehydrated skin love it. Hyaluronic based moisturizers are hit or miss for me. Some cause break outs and some dont. Unfortunately this one caused a new breakout every time I wore it. I've found a similar type of moisturizer from FAB that works well but is unfortunately more expensive.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,After days of using my skin broke out. Will not recommend to any one.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I loved this mask. It smelled clean and felt good on the skin. Only thing is the te and mouth holes are not cut out all the way. They have like a flap. Which is okay because if you want to take a small nap while it's working you can hydrate your lips and mouth, but what if I wanna eat popcorn and watch TV? They're just hanging there.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,So I love this moisturizer because it's a dupe for Beliefs Aqua bomb. It has the same feelings and cooling sensation. It makes you look hydrated and doesn't leave a sticky feeling when it absorbs. Doesn't break me out. I have dry normal skin and my nose tends to peel after a hot shower. So I apply this and it feels awesome.,2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use it right after I wash my face. At night I put it on and let it absorb but if needed will apply a heavier night cream.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,It feels light on your face. Does not feel or look greasy.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I bought this same product but from target. This is amazing in the summer if you have oily skin. It's not greasy at all. By far, this is my favorite moisturizer",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,works well and smells amazing!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have an oily Tzone and this works for me. It dries quickly for the girl getting ready in a hurry in the morning. I love it.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I really wanted to like this mask. I have heard good things about this mask so I bought one to try. However, I simply couldn't get past it not staying securely on my face for even 2 seconds so I threw it away.",4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This caused really bad breakouts for me from small bumps to cystic acne. Will be returning.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I just love this product.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Nice product. I goes on nicely and smells amazing. I'll be buying it again.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,apply after face washing and before applying makeup,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,You need this,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I love this type of mask. I have acne prone skin that gets very dry during the winter. This definitely helps without causing extra breakouts. It can be messy when you open the package from the liquid on the mask.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I would just use one pump of this on my face every day and I just kept noticing my face getting more oily. I saw no beneficial effects after using it for almost 5 weeks.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This stuff is... AMAZING!! I recently had a bad skin reaction to a mask I did so my face was SO dry. I'm talking like patches of dry flaky skin. I applied this 3 times a day for two days and the dryness was gone. A little goes a long way with this product which I enjoy. Highly recommend and will be buying again!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have added this to my everyday routine. I love it I think it's a dupe for the H20+ Oasis Hydrating moisturizer. I love the Hydro Boost Line sm.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"My husband's dermatologist recommended this product. He tried it and loves it. Now it's all he will use. I always keep an extra on hand since he goes through it so quickly. Thats the thing, the gel is so light that it absorbs very quickly and you use more of it. Overall, I would recommend this product.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I generally have oily skin but its more combination in the winter months. The daily moisturizer that I use works so well at minimizes oil that it leaves dry patches around my chin and forehead during the winter months so I supplement it with this moisturizer at night and it works great for me. It does take more than a few minutes to absorbs but it does make your skin feel super moisturized. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone with oily skin for summertime though.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have now used this twice & I LOVE it. I'm a big fan of the Hydro Boost line. I have the moisturizer, the eye moisturizer & the fragrance free lotion. I love em all.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"The only thing I don't like is the container. I hate cosmetics that come in these pots. It is difficult to get all of the product out. If you have nails and are sticking you fingers in to get the moisturizer out, some of it always ends up under your fingernails. Pot is also heavy for travel. Container looks great, but not convenient at all to use.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I don't write reviews, but MY GOD this stuff is amazing! It's literally like heaven in a jar for my skin. I have combo skin, oily in my t-zone and normal on the perimeter. This instantly hydrates my skin without the greasy feeling. The best way to describe it is almost like putting water on your face and letting it soak in. Can't find any other moisturizer to replace it! My absolute FAVE!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Love this moisturizer! Curology recommended it so I decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. So light weight and it feels like heaven when you put it on. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate it at all. My face feels hydrated all day after using this. Definitely recommend!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Great product for daily use in the winter months for moisture.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I bought this because I heard such amazing things about it. I had to stop using this because of a burning sensation and irritation of my skin. I can not recommend this product! Buyer beware.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Those with sensitive skin should stay away from this product. I have sensitive skin and it is always difficult to find something that won't irritate my face. I really wanted to like this, but my skin broke out very quickly after use. I don't usually have terrible break outs but this caused really painful cystic acne. Disappointing.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"My face gets very dry this time of year, I use this twice a week and my face is so hydrated.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Usually get the H2O+ moisturizer but was wanting to try cheaper the results are very similar but the smell is pretty strong..,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Was finally getting my skin under control (extremely sensitive/acne prone) and I decided to get this moisturizer to complete my regimen. After a week of use, it completely reversed the condition of my skin, caused redness, itchiness, and even nodular acne. The product does not feel right when applying and feels plain gross when it sets. Do not recommenced",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I absolutely love this moisturizer,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I actually don't mind the smell and I am a big smell person. I thought it worked great for my dry skin, especially for this time of year. I do think it's a bit slippery, although it does stay on your face once you get it on. And I wish it came in 1 piece instead of 2. I also think the flaps for the eyes and mouth holes are kind of a waste. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this product! I have a slightly oily t-zone and really dry skin in the winter around my mouth and chin. It helped clear it up! Would buy again.",4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I wanted to like this product, it moisturized nicely and absorbed nicely into my skin...it seemed to last a long time...however it had a really strong detergent-like smell to it and it caused a reaction in my skin...little red bumps everywhere...not acne but hard bumps...they haven't gone away yet!! Do not recommend if you have sensitive skin unfortunately.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I buy two every week to add to my weekly facial routine. The formula is deep penetrating and works even better with the cream mask from the hydro boost line.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"A couple months ago, I had the worst breakout of my life, no exaggeration. Cysts, zits, scarring, dry, flaky skin. All of it. I knew my moisturizer was making me break out this way, but I kept using because my skin is so ridiculously dry. Out of desperation, I bought this gel on a whim, and it WORKED. My skin is dry enough that I sometimes need a second or third application, but it never ever makes me break out or feel greasy. Skin as soft as anything and calms my overheating and redness. Even though its a little out of my price range, I'm investing in this again. Really really worth it. Only complaint is the ""smaller on the inside"" concept. I ran out of this stuff pretty quickly. Wish you got more.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This is a very vert thin moisturizer, I did not find it all that hydrating personally. I am going to use it up and not repurchase again.

For the price, I expected a lot more, but I still ended up having to use something else at night for my dry skin.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use this in the morning before my makeup and at night after I wash my face,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love this!! I have combination type skin but with the colder weather, my skin gets more dry. This moisturizer hydrated my dry patches while not making my t zone oily! When applying, a little goes a long way!",3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I bought this product because I'm getting older and my skin is drying out. I use this product and then I use ROC as a moisturizer.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Nighttime moisturizer,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have been using this product for about 6 months. I use it in the mornings, before I apply my makeup. It goes on really smoothly and absorbs quickly. Within about a month of use, I noticed that the fine lines around my eyes looked less noticeable, and I actually looked younger! I am 57, and I am receiving compliments on my skin. LOVE this product!!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Since menopause I have crazy sensitive skin that is very acne prone, and sometimes with rosacea. Oh, it has been so hard. I took a chance on this line and it is healing my skin. My breakouts are starting to go away. I bought the cleanser, this moisturizer and eye cream. Now that I am a couple weeks in, I am going to buy the serum. I am so thankful to have found and tried these products. BTW, I bought the mask and tried it this weekend - so soothing.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have oily skin and this is the best moisturizer ice tried on my skin,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have tried so many sheet masks and this is by far my favorite. I love the jelly consistency, so it doesn't fall off your face, super cooking and moisturizing without leaving a weird film on my face. Absolutely love for any da!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"My face tends to get oily through out the day but sometimes I'll have those days where I'm just DRY. This has really worked well for my skin the past couple of weeks and esp for the winter months, it's been super hydrating without making my face slough with oil during the day. Highly recommend!! Also the gel aspect of this moisturizer is soooo refreshing when you put it on!",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I was hesitant about this moisturizer because I have combo skin but it works well! Gives me the moisture I need without making my face oily through out the day!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I use this every evening after cleansing. Honestly, I have found that it works well before or after my nightly serum. I have very sensitive skin and was concerned about allergies, but did totally fine with this. It has balanced my combo skin and added wonderful softness. My skin drinks it in without a heavy, oily feeling.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This is an amazing product which I have been loving lately. It goes on my skin smooth after shower and it keeps my face hydrated... I can see that my face is a little bit more healthy looking! Overall a great product for the affordabale price!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,left my skin very moisturized and healthy looking! 10/10,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"After cleansing my face mornings and nights, I like to moisturize with this gel and it's great! It goes on smoothly and it feels really nice. It smells good, it's cool, light, and it absorbs rather quickly. I have very dry skin and this has helped me along with using my rosehip oil.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've been using this product for over a year now and have loved it, although I've noticed that it has started to burn whenever I put it on after washing my face and using it after my toner and serum (which is what I've always done.) this could very well be due to my personal skin type changing, but it is heartbreaking due to the fact that it is one of my favorite moisturizers. The burning stops after it absorbs in, but has anyone else had an experience like this? Did Neutrogena possibly change the formula?",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I tried this mask because I have dry skin and I use the hydro boost cleanser, and I HATED IT!!!! 1. Made me breakout, 2. Bad smell, and 3. WAY TO SLIPPERY!!! DEFINITELY would NOT recommend",1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"My skin seems to like this one better than the jar versions. I think it's because this has glycerin as a top ingredient, instead of the dimethicone that is in the jar versions. Overall, my skin feels more moisturized and hydrated with this line!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have combination skin and I do a modify 10 step k-beauty. I love these masks and use them for my night time routine. This is great to calm the skin after being in make up for 6-8 hours. Plus it's cheaper than many sheet masks that are out there. It leaves the skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I love how this stuff makes my skin feel. It helps moisturize but I need something with a little more oomph. It works really well for a night or morning routine.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use this as my daily moisturizer under my makeup. It works well but I will probably go back to the Olay daily moisturizer as it's more cost efficient and they seem to do the same thing. This smells like sunscreen.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I used it immediately after cleansing my skin and it worked perfectly. I would recommend using a toner right before applying it but it isnt completely necessary.,1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This mask is easy to use and left my ""life-experienced"",sensitive skin feeling hydrated.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"if you have oily skin this is for you! laura lee recommended in a video that lotion moisturizers tend to break oily skin out. so naturally, i tried this and i am blown away! worth every cent!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I brought this because I read some good reviews and asked the lady at the store. This gel feels great went on smooth...but it did not hydrate or moisturize my skin. Minutes later i could see dry patches on my face.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,oh my god. this product is so honestly amazing. i was a bit skeptical about it at first because some reviews said it made them break out and it smelled strong like a man's musk but it really really doesn't. it smells fresh and clean but it's not overpowering. this gives my skin the extra (hydro) boost that it needs to look refreshed and does NOT leave me oily. i have combo skin and it just evens everything out and paired with the Tatcha Silk Canvas... makes a perfect pair for skin care. love love love.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Started getting into this mask once Jackie Ania did her face routine one day.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Laura Lee did a review of this product and I decided to check it out and I'm sure glad I did. I was super skeptical about it because I'm used to using Clinique Moisture Surge. This hydrates my skin and absorbs quickly without leaving behind any residue. I ‚ù§Ô∏è using this after a mask. This product doesn't last long for me but it's not too expensive compared with similar products with similar ingredients.,3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,strong fragrance but it feels so cooling and nice!!! My skin has been super dry due to all my acne creams and this helped a lot. Would buy again.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"it doesn't last long, I had to constantly reapply it when I used to use this product.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love this stuff! It is reasonably priced, and I noticed a big difference within three days, or so.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I used to love this product when I didn't have acne in the summer but once I moved south my skin got way more oily and way more acne prone. The gel started to look weird on my skin and my mom noticed a difference in how my skin looked when I stopped using it. When my skin clears up I might go back to this but overall it just wasnt a good product for acne,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I was put on this product as part of a skin care regime for some issues I was having. It is AMAZING! The way it plumps up my skin and smooths it out - I swear it makes me look 10 years younger every time I use it. It absorbs right into my skin and makes it feel so good. I will never go back to a moisturizer!,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love this moisturizer. I am in my late 20's and have combination (oily and dry) skin. I had been looking for a product that balanced my skin and has anti-aging properties. This is perfect! No more shine on my face from other moisturizers. This product is soothing, feels great, goes on easily, and lasts all day. I highly recommend it.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This is honestly the best moisturizer I've ever tried. It's so hydrating and slick, but it's not oily or thick or anything like that. It leaves my skin looking absolutely beautiful every time I use it. I've used this moisturizer regularly for the past year and a half and I've definitely noticed a difference in my skin. My skin is brighter, glowy, smoother, and I've even noticed my acne isn't as bad since throwing this in my daily regimen. This product is honestly my holy grail!!!!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use it every day,2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,totally loved it its great for oily skin its better than the clinique gel moisterizer ! would be ordering more and more‚ù§Ô∏è,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I purchased this moisturizer recently after the Aveeno one I was using was discontinued. I had used the fragrance and dye free version of this when this line first came out. I liked it but needed something a little more hydrating in winter. This batch (with the fragrance and dye) has such a strong, masculine scent that I don't think I will purchase it again. I don't know why skincare (facial especially) is fragranced at all. The smell is just so strong and not a good choice for sensitive skin. I also don't understand why there is so much packaging for this. The container is huge for a small amount of cream, and then it comes in a huge box! Unless they bring back the fragrance free version again I will be skipping this the next time I need to buy a moisturizer.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Apply to my face as a moisturizer Before I prime and apply my makeup,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love the hydro gel line SO much, the moisturizer and face wash is amazing, not only can you instantly feel a difference in the softness of your skin, but they all smell so good! But, this product was definitely the flop of the line in my opinion. If you are acne prone, I wouldn't recommend this product at all. My entire face broke out through our the first day of wearing this ( the other products that I've tried from this line haven't had the same results at all ) I wanted to love it, and I hate that I don't, but I definitely would pass if you're looking for a good sun screen that doesn't clog your pores.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I started using this moisturizer a month ago and I absolutely love it. This moisturizer absorbs into the skin quickly, doesn't make my skin oily, and also hydrates the areas of my skin that are dry. Before using this moisturizer I felt that my makeup always looked flaky and oily at the same time and I thought it was the makeup I was using. After using this moisturizer, my makeup looks smooth and I haven't experienced any of the strange flaky/oily phenomena. The only reason I took away a star on this review is because the product doesn't last very long. I've only had mine for a little over a month and it's almost empty.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,The line works well together. I'm glad I swirched,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This made my skin feel so soft and hydrated and all of my dry areas are completely gone!!! Honestly would recommend for all skin types.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This moisturizer works well for my combination and acne-prone skin. I like that it has SPF, but is not greasy or heavy like other moisturizers with SPF.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This product was a huge surprise. Normally I use higher end hydrogel like from Boscia. I also use Pacifica sheet mask on my dry acne prone skin. This was crazy not only did it stay on but did not have a sticky or tacky feeling on my face. My face just feels hydrated and looks fresh.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I used to use Clinique 3 step, but it started making me much more oily than I already am. Laura Lee had a review on this, and oh my gosh it's the best. I use this and the face wash twice a day. I've became less oily, my face is much softer, and brighter. I've tried so many different face washes and lotions, this is by far my favorite!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Use this product at night! Need more moisture for day wear. Absorbs to a soft finish. Use quite a bit of the product to feel moistured and wait a few minutes to soak in.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Not recommended for sensitive skin!! This made my skin burn so bad and I never have acne but this completely broke out my skin. Don't apply before makeup it will make it slippery,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I tried this mask for the first time last night, and I woke up this morning to hydrated, but tight skin. I like the tightning effect! I think I'll explore more Hydro Boost products now. This mask may have to be added to my weekly routine!",1,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have bought three pots of this product and am still happy with it. I have combo skin that's on the dry side in the winter and a little oilier in the summer, and this works for both. It's never broken me out like most do, but when you really want some extra hydration I would consider an eye cream or night cream because this will provide only a daily light hydration. I use it over my Derma E vitamin C serum and under concealer alone, and I think it really gives that nice glow without getting really greasy.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Makes my skin so much softer,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"At first, I really enjoyed this moisturizer. It smells good and sinks in the skin quickly. I used it for two days and my skin texture changed. I noticed several small bumps on day 1. I chose to ignore it and keep using the product. The next day I woke up with cystic acne. Once I stopped using the product my skin cleared up in a few days. If you do not have sensitive skin you will probably enjoy this, it just was not for me.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have normal to dry skin and felt like my regular moisturizer just wasn't doing enough. My mom suggested this and she was right! I use VERY LITTLE under my moisturizer and it really helps keep those dry patches hydrated throughout the day. Doesn't look greasy at all.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have very oily skin and have been looking for a moisturizer that would keep my skin hydrated without enhancing the oils in my skin. The moisturizer I was using before this one did just that and was on the pricier side. I bought this after hearing such great reviews thinking it would be perfect for my skin while being more affordable. Unfortunately after a couple of weeks I noticed my skin was beginning to feel very tight and dry patches started to appear on my cheeks. I have since stopped using this product and gone back to my old moisturizer and doing this alone has brought my skin back to life. I think I would prefer being a tad bit oily than have random dry patches on my skin. It is disappointing since I had really high hopes for this product.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I bought this after not wanting to spend too much on my last moisturizer. I was previously using Clinique Moisture Surge. I use this twice a day, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and supple! I have combination skin, and this moisturizer doesn't leave me feeling oily or sticky!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Okay, so this mask actually stays on unlike other masks. It's so soothing and makes me feel moisturized",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"It works well, I have dry skin and it keeps my skin hydrated but I personally wanted something that looked a little more glowy whereas this is matte and makes my B.B. cream look matte on top.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have very oily skin and this has help improved that. It moisturizes skin and doesn't feel sticky or greasy. Absorbs fast. Have been using this for years and will continue to use it.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Best moisturize ever,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I was using murad but this brand works just as well and half the price,3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use after washing my face,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"While I don't wear makeup anymore, I have paid a lot for face products to increase moisture and elasticity, this is the first one that actually did this. I wear an oxygen mask at night, in the past 4 years, I have had a dent across my cheek every day. When I first took this home I put a little on just to see how it felt, because I hate greasy. The next day I woke up in the morning with no mark, and every day since!! I hope to purchase this product for the rest of my days.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have very tricky skin, and this moisturizer was a solid win for me. My skin is oily and acne-prone, and breaks out from almost anything. I was previously using Cerave's morning and night time moisturizers, but they made me greasy and didn't hydrate my skin. This product, however, is seemingly perfect for me. It hydrates, absorbs quickly, and doesn't break me out. Not to mention, it smells amazing!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"The gel mask is too slippery, the fragrance burns the eyes, added synthetic color, and the essence is so watery it makes a mess from right when you open it to when you apply it. It's an okay mask just for the cooling effect but other than that no hydration whats so ever. Want a sheet mask? Get one from an actual K Beauty brand (Skinfood Gel Masks are to die for).",3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,My skin is very dry. I like this product so far because it seems to be moisturizing without leaving a greasy layer on my skin,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Fragrance usually isn't a problem for me, but with this product, I think it was just too much. It's a fine moisturizer - light, non-greasy, although it didn't seem to last very long and it took a while to absorb - but if you have sensitive skin, I recommend steering clear, especially if you're sensitive to fragrance. It has a very strong scent and left a slight burning sensation when first applied. A shame, because I really wanted to like this one! For something similar that didn't give my skin any issues, try Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+. Much more sensitive skin-friendly.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"i have very oily skin and when i use this it keeps me matte for most of the day, but it makes my skin feel a little tight and leaves some dry patches. In those areas i will just put more product on",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"When used alone I really like this moisturizer! It melts into the skin nicely. But when I use my Coola SPF 30 Face Sunscreen on top of it, it pills up and feels gross on the skin. Do not recommend with spf over top.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This is probably the best mask I've ever bought.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"excuse my spelling and grammar please, i'm dyslexic. i bought like 6 of these at a local drugstore (ulta doesn't ship to alaska and the closest one is literally 1-5,000 miles away) i have normal/dry dehydrated skin, leaning on the sensitive side. but not too sensitive, i can put some products with fragrance on my face if it's not too much. this tho. this was too much fragrance for me, it's SO STRONG. it smells like a perfume your grandma would wear. sadly most of the masks at the drugstore are like this. the fragrance was so strong, in fact, that it made my skin itch and i had a little breakout. but i used them all tho, nonetheless. i did however like how hydrated it made my skin feel. i highly recommend the hydro boost face wash over these, there is fragrance in it but it's not overpowering like this is. it's actually rather nice. hopefully the whole line doesn't smell like this.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I'm absolutely obsessed with this moisturizer! So hydrating and replenishing. I can't stop recommending it. Also, Neutrogena can we get this scent as a perfume asap? I'd by it. SO GOOD",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,These are incredible if you are looking for a quick pick me up for your skin. Hyaluronic acid is a very gentle acid that attracts water molecules. It's the perfect ingredient for moisture. I have very sensitive skin and I'm be had no problems with these masks. They're easy to apply since it's in 2 pieces and they hold a lot of product. I have repurchased numerous times and will continue to do so,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I honestly buy this because it is a moisturizer that agrees with my skin AND is affordable And comes in a tube. Hard combo to find, strangely. So many of the moisturizers I like come in a tub you have to stick your finger in, yuck. I try to use a spatula, but always end up dipping my finger in when in a hurry or something. So, this stuff it is!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Love this!,2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"The mask is in two halves which i appreciate, it stays on fine but i was laying down. The packaging is pretty, it's kinda rainbowy. It hydrated my face to some effect, but my insanely dry nose is still somewhat dry. Everywhere else on my face does feel quenched though. My cheeks feel deeply hydrated, but they're the only place. My cheeks also feel very supple. It's less papery than an ordinary sheet mask. It contoured to my skin well. It felt gentle on my skin, but towards the end of the 15 minutes it felt a bit itchy.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've been using this for almost a week after I quit another moisturizer that made me break out, and so far it's been my holy grail. Feels amazing when applied and it stays throughout the day. My face is naturally oily and I feel like I always have to dab throughout the day, but with this I don't. If it keeps up, I will forever use this! Also way less expensive than other moisturizers that have failed me. Definitely give it a try if you've been searching for that perfect skin care tool!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use this every night before bed. It goes on smooth and easy. It hydrates well and it has such a light clean smell. It makes my face feel so soft and replenished. It seems to work really well under makeup too. I hope they can make something similar with SPF in it in the future. I love this product!,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Was so excited to use this because I've been using Neutrogena for years and years. But after a few days, my skin started to get red and break out around my chin. At first, I didn't know why but, as a precautionary measure, I stopped all my skincare for a couple days. My zits went away and no new ones formed. I used my other products without this gel, and no breakouts happened. Let's say, i wasn't happy.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I use this every day under my makeup. Works great, doesn't cause trouble when applying foundation.",4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"When I first began using the hydro-boost gel, I used the one in the jar. The pump is more hygienic and this version has spf! I've noticed it makes a difference in my skin in the cold winter months and the harsh summer. I walk to and from the train station to get to work each day and this gel has been great against the elements and does not cause me to break out. My only complaint is that I need to wear makeup over it because it makes my skin appear shiny. The gel without the spf does not have this effect on my skin. I have combination skin that tends to get oily.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I've tried this product a while back but I opt out for Garnier version of hydra boost only because this product isn't long lasting.

There are days where after I applied it for 20mins I can feel my skin little dry. I wouldn't use during winter.,1,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"My skin is loving this quenching product. It took a bit for it to get my skin more supple but it is doing the trick. Leaves my skin so soft too. A little goes a long way as well. I like the size of this. Usually these types of products are small, almost mini & the fact that this isn't is a plus to me.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This moisturizer is great for layering + works fantastic under makeup. Sometimes in winter I use a thicker moisturizer at night bc this one is lighter than a cream. Perfect for summer moisturizing. Definitely plumps the skin.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"First impressions: Nice texture and applies easily, but what a HORRIBLE smell. Overwhelming laundry detergent scent that lingers long after the application. Also, why do companies add fragrances and dyes to their products? They serve no beneficial purpose. I had high hopes for this product as I was looking for an oil-free moisturizer for my acne-prone skin. Sadly this is not it. If you look carefully at the ingredients list, the product is full of silicones which will ""sit"" on top of your skin. That's what gives your skin the illusion of suppleness and hydration, not the hyaluronic acid, which is very low on the list. Also, highly irritating ingredients in this. I had rubbed one of my eyes which proceeded to cause horrible irritation and sensitivity even with washing hands after applying the gel. If your skin tolerates anything, I can see this being used as a somewhat decent primer. Otherwise, look elsewhere for a skin-friendly moisturizer that actually does the job.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I'm obsessed with the whole hydro boost line. This is a great multipurpose sunscreen and moisturizer. It's not greasy, doesn't leave a film or purple cast to skin. Also it does not inhibit makeup application. It for well with all my products!",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Used it for the first time yesterday and loved it. It is kind of messy however, I used the extra prodduct as a serum after the mask was done. I suggest you take some time and lay down while using the mask. If you move around it can slide off.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,When I took this out of the packaging liquid spilled all over the place and this did not feel good at all on my skin. Should've read the reviews prior to trying. Also this dried out within 2 minutes on my skin,5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I've used this stuff ever since it came out. One reason why I love it is the scent. It reminds me of a beach or a spa. It even invokes childhood memories of going swimming! I just wish it was at least SPF 30 (the reason for 4 stars not 5). I like that it contains hyaluronic acid.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This gave my Peter Thomas Roth thirst quencher a run for the money for HALF the cost. Absorbs quickly not greasy gives you the hydration you need.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I started using this a month or so ago. I absolutely LOVE this! This seriously makes my skin feel super quenched as soon as I put it on. It doesn't make my skin feel greasy, or under-moisturized. Like Goldilocks said ""It's just right"". For reference, my skin is fairly oily in the T zone and more dry around my cheeks. The only con would be that the tub lasts me 2-3 weeks. It's worth the cost, though!",4.4,,

I wanted to wait before reviewing because it is very new to me, but I couldn't wait since it has been so amazing. There is no strong scent, it didn't irritate my skin, it smoothed out dry patches that have been on my face for months, and it has a great cooling effect.

I would compare this stuff to the True Cream Aquabomb by Belif, which I've bought before. This water gel is better, and cheaper! Definitely go with the gel if you are more combo/oily, and cream if you are more dry. The gel is perfect, feels refreshing and moisturizes pretty well throughout the day.

I recommend it for oily and/or combination skin because it does not leave your face feeling greasy after you apply it. It applies on smoothly and it has such a fresh, clean scent! Definitely will repurchase.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I am really liking this but I'm still a little too dry after I put on a small amount so I'm applying it twice and it helps. I think my skin is just more dry than usual with the weather changing too frequently but I feel like I'll love it during summer. Might get the thicker one for the winter months next time.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I just turned 40 and was looking for a product to help with my fine lines and dryness. After 4 days I'm already seeing improvement,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I used to be a big fan of the Skyn Iceland moisturizer (still love it) but when I discovered this it began to become my favorite! I have combination skin and get really dry by my chin and cheeks and when I put this on I saw results the next day. It defiantly feels like you're putting water on and I get oily on my nose and forehead so I was nervous that this would make it worse, it doesn't!

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I love this sheet mask! It doesn't break me out or upsets my super sensitive skin and it really hydrates it! I only use this once in a while when I feel like my skin needs a little extra help and the price is reasonable. Only thing I don't like about it is it comes in two parts- one sheet from the nose up and one sheet from nose down. I think it should just be one cohesive sheet and it's kinda annoying. Overall love it though and such a great product!,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I was an avid user of Clinique Moisture Surge for years. The price point was a bit high, but I found it to be more effective and less greasy than traditional face lotions. When this option came out, I was excited to see if it was comparable, and I'm happy to say that it is! I can use this product at night and in the morning without clogging of pores or a greasy feeling. It is also long lasting, so it is worth the price.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have NEVER in my life (and I'm just now in my 60's), found any kind of moisturizer that didn't feel greasy on my face. I was thrilled to find this product!

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use this product after I wash my face.,2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This product sucked. I have dry skin and this did nothing to help that. I would put 2 or 3 layers of this on my face and my face still felt tight and dry. I hated this so much.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have oily skin so I was on the market for a water based moisturizer that wouldn't leave any greasiness on my skin. This definitely hits the mark!! I love how it absorbs and leaves my skin feeling fresh. This allows me to use it every day, even under my makeup, which is exactly what I'm looking for. Only downside to it is i sometimes use another moisturizer on top of it or sometimes I use a heavier cream at night, just because I'm not sure how deep this is actually moisturizing.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This is perfect if you want a lightweight moisturizer that keeps your skin hydrated for hours on end. I'm oily and this helps to reduce the amount of oil that my skin produces and makes my makeup last longer without blotting. I wouldn't recommend for those who have dry skin because it's very lightweight.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Super hydrating mom greasy great for year round. I have combo skin,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I loved it at first because it was gonna under makeup but after a a day or two i started to break out. I took a break after using it and then I tried it again and it still broke me out,2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I usually never leave reviews but this stuff is AMAZING!!!! I have normal to oily skin and I've tried a million ""gel"" moisturizers and this one is the winner. Idk how it does it but it makes my face look matte but feel amazingly moisturized all day. Will literally never use anything else as a day moisturizer",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I've loved Neutrogena products as long as I can remember (over twenty five years). This new moisturizer does not disappoint. Hydrates my skin all day and prepares my skin for flawless foundation coverage. All I would say is to try it for yourself.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I was super excited to dry this product for winter skin, but it instantly left a burning sensation and I ended up with a significant dry patch/scabbing on my forehead. Very disappointed!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have very oily skin, but at the same time, there are parts of my face that dry up. I wasn't able to find a moisturizer that did not clog my pores and didn't add any extra oils to my skin but at the same time hydrate my skin. When I tried this product out, it felt amazing. It does not feel heavy, and my skin quickly absorbs it. I always use this product and I probably always will!",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This products masks my oil and highlights the high points of my face (cheek bones, temples, nose bridge, etc.) giving your face a SUPER healthy looking shine.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I started using this stuff after running out of my Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel Cream, and let me tell ya: I have no regrets. This gel moisturizes so well, and it doesn't make me look greasy! My face feels amazing, and my makeup applies great after using this. Plus, you get a lot of product for pretty cheap, and a little bit goes a very long way!!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,So I just purchased this item and I must say I love it already! I have combo skin. I exfoliated my face and cleansed it and applied this right after and my skin felt amazing. It was so soft and supple just like it says on the container. Also it smells soooooo amazing. I have never used a moisturizer I love as much as this one. I definitely recommend to purchase this item.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I started using the regular hydro-boost moisturizer before I convinced myself to go for the one with spf protection. I walk about 3 miles every day, and this product makes me feel better about exposing my skin to the elements. My only complaint is that it does tend to make my skin shiny if I wear it without makeup. Under makeup, you cannot tell at all. I have combination skin that's prone to breakouts and I'm happy to see this moisturizer does not cause me to break out at all. That's the best part about using any Neutrogena moisturizer.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I purchased this moisturizer back in January in hopes it would live up to the hype. It has done that and more. It quickly became a staple in my skincare routine. I use it in the morning after washing my face and before makeup application and it creates a beautiful supple base. I sometime will even use it before putting on my night cream if I feel I need a little extra hydration. If you like the clinique moisture surge gel, you will love this. Absolutely worth it for what you pay. I also have compared this to the Peter Thomas Roth hyaluronic acid water gel and this is not nearly as sticky and absorbs much quicker.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I absolutely LOVE this stuff!!!! Between cold weather and a seemingly endless bout of sickness this winter, there was no hope for my dry skin.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"You probably could use this mask daily and be just fine, but I prefer to use it once a week to feel fancy. I wish this didn't come cut in half across the face in favor of one solid sheet mask. It is slippery and drips all over the place, but the refreshing coolness feels amazing around the eyes and cheeks. I have no idea if it does wonders, as it leaves my skin with the same lovely feeling as the water gel and serum, but I have nothing against it.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I'm not sure if it will help with my wrinkles etc. because I just started using it, but I hope so because I absolutely love it. The texture is so smooth and the fragrance is so light. But it also seems very luxurious to put on.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I got this as a sample, and I'm so glad I did, because I would not have bought it without trying it. I'm 50, have combo skin, with a few wrinkles such as the 11s between my eyebrows. I tried it, and only needed 2 pinheads worth. 1 for my face and one for my neck. 24 hrs later my face is still moisturized...but not greasy. I even put a little on my one rough abused perpetually dried out elbow. And notice a big difference that I think with daily use I may be able to get it back to normal. You can't go wrong with the price. And compared to other hyraluronic creams I've tried it is on par at 1/4 to 1/3 the price",3,,

And the other one is that it is quite slippery so you might need to rest while you use this mask, but i promise you, it's all ALL worth it.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have severely dry skin to the point where my skin flakes on my face. I've tried every moisturizer under the sun and this one is definitely the best!,5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I looove this moisturizer. My skin has been insanely dry, irritated, flaky in the last week. I picked this up on Saturday to give it a try. It makes my skin feel so plump and just well hydrated after applying it. A little goes a long way!! One little dip of your finger can cover your whole face. It is absorbed so quickly it doesn't feel greasy whatsoever. It does have a pretty strong perfume scent but I think it's well worth looking past. I have tried this and the 'Tarte drink of. H2O' the tarte one definitely has a more pleasant scent but it doesn't feel as hydrating and doesn't absorb as well as this one. Soo worth buying!!",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Love how this makes my skin feel.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I usually have dry skin so I would use this product as a mositurizer. It's so great I now use it as a daily moisturizer after washing my face. It's lightweight and perfect for dry skin!!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"One of the best moisturizers I've ever tried. My skin is usually very dry and flaky, so I need a really good product, yet I hate the feel of cream moisturizers. This one really does the trick!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I had a severe allergic reaction to this product. So bad it required medical attention. I do not in any way have sensitive skin, and have used many Neutrogena products most of my life. Dermatologist tested? I would rethink that one.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"It's an okay product. I have exzema though, so I don't know if that had a big impact on my usage.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have been using tarte h20 rainforest of the sea moisturizer for a while and let me tell you I can't tell the difference between the two. Except this is half the price! I know part of the price difference is bc tarte is cruelty free but the final product is comparable in quality. I have combo skin and this works great, its not greasy and it helps tremendously. it was recommended by a youtuber who swore it was a holy grail and it doesn't disappoint!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love using this product in the morning. I use it to add a bit more moisture to my skin after my skin care lotion. It's a great way to rehydrate your face after cleansing. It's not a deep moisturizer, it's more of a superficial, quick refresh type moisturizer. I use it for face and neck.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This is the best moisturizer I've used for my oily skin. I apply it after toner right after I get out of the shower and it absorbs quickly and moisturizes my skin so well without leaving it feeling greasy. It also smells amazing!,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,It sucks,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,When I put this on it burned my skin and leaving my face red and my eczema acting up because of it.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I apply this moisturizer after I wash my face, and use my toner and serum. I've been loving this moisturizer. Oily skin requires gel based products and this moisturizer is amazing. It's so light on the skin but packs a punch of hydration without the oil base and pore clogging factors. Perfect before applying makeup.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,this is my go to and favorite moisturizer,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I recently transitioned from having oily skin to discovering dry patches along my jawline and Chin. So I think it's safe to say I have that nice combination skin going on. This is the only moisturizer I found where the scent isnt incredibly heavy and it doesn't feel like a thick sticky lotion. It's very smooth going on it absorbs quickly and after it dries it leaves your skin feeling so smooth and soft. It definitely last all day and a little tiny bit goes a long way because the formula spreads nicely. I love the feel of this gel, very clean and pleasant.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I wanted to love this product, but it really did nothing for my dry skin. I will not be purchasing again.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"a little goes a long way with this moisturizer. this is great for people with oily skin, but i have combo skin and wanted a little bit more moisture on my face so i use a hyaluronic serum or face oil with this. Its light and absorbs well, so this is great for morning use, under makeup, or during the summer time.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I do not like creamy stuff on my face and this is the perfect solution. I could continue on with how it makes me feel. I can go in public without thinking everyone is looking at my dry skin face. Yahoo very happy.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have very oily skin and it just cancels it out PERFECTLY and my makeup goes on so smooth and makes sure it stays in place.,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,great product overall,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Too many 'cones. Felt really nice, lightweight, but broke me out.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I apply this gel in morning after shower and at night after removing make up. Gel holds in skin's moisture. Even my facialist noticed the difference.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've had hard times finding a good moisturizer due to my oily skin. First time I tested out I cleaned my face in the morning and only put on this moisturizer to put it to the test. It absorbs quickly, it left my skin so smooth, and I couldn't believe my nose wasn't greasy at the end of the day. Which my nose is the most oily part of my face.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,My daughter sent me my first bottle and I have been hooked ever since love it.,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I debated on whether to get this or thedru skin version of this with winter coming. I should have gone with the dry skin version. It goes on great, light, and dries super quick. However, I don't feel like it lasts like it claims it's supposed to. It does have a cool feeling going on, if you like that. Smell wise- it's unique, not gross but I don't really care for it. My skin started to look dry again by late night. I feel like this needs to be applied multiple times a day to be effective. I think it's a bit over-rated and over priced for the quality.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"My skin is less oily and my makeup holds better than with my old moisturizer. Feels very smooth and soft on my skin almost like silicone. Absorbs quickly, mild but pleasant scent. Skin is usually prone to breakouts but have not had an issue with this thus far. Will buy again!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Use to increase moisture loss... Mature skin,2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"The product is great! It moisturizes my t-zone well, which is why I bought it. However, since I have combination the areas outside my t-zone are dry, especially now since it's getting colder. It doesn't moisturize some of my dry areas, including around my mouth and parts of my cheeks, well. I have to use a heavier cream to moisturize these parts. This isn't terrible, considering gels aren't meant for dry skin. However, for the price, it would have been nice if worked in my drier areas. Maybe this product will work well all over the face for people with oily skin, but combination and dry skin types should proceed with caution. I'm giving it four stars because the product worked well in summer, but not so much in colder temperatures.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've waited to try this because I have so much skincare that it's overwhelming to introduce something new into my routine - I tend to waste a lot as it is. My skin type: skin tone, light to medium; fine lines, enlarged pores, combination/oily skin with dryness around my eyes (my entire orbital area) if I don't consume plenty of water and moisturize properly. I follow a strict beauty routine that includes different cleansers for morning and night. I double cleanse after I wear makeup and use specific serums and moisturizers in the morning and then use separate and different types of serums and moisturizers at night. My morning routine includes a stabalized Vitamin C Serum combined with a Serum to lock it in, followed with a light cream for my cheeks and nose; a cream for the rest of my face, an eye serum, then 2 heavier eye creams. My nighttime routine is similar only I use an AHA and BHA, then heavier serums and creams with pure sqaulane oil, then a heavier gel moisturizer to lock it all in. It works for me and keeps my skin balanced. I'm conscientious of all ingredients in Skincare and makeup. Although my skin has oily areas, I would rather be super moisturized than dry. I do what I can to prevent deep wrinkles. Because I have spent so much money on skincare products with rave reviews, I waited to buy this. I've been eyeballing it since it was introduced to the consumer. The list of ingredients would leave one to believe that this moisturizer would be great; however, it managed to break my face out, leave my face feeling like I had a something as heavy as Pond's cold cream on, yet made my face and neck peel ALL over. I had no smooth areas for over a week and that's been with me taking desperate measures. My skin has started to repair, but thanks to that whole buy one, get one 50% off (this should have been a red flag) I now have two jars of this cheap junk that I don't even want to give to anyone.

I didn't notice the smell lasting throughout the day though, only when I first opened the jar. The gel felt nice and cool on my skin, but I don't feel like it really absorbed into my skin or provided much moisture, just kinda sat on top.

It burns going on, and the smell lingers even after I've applied and set my makeup. It also caused numerous dry patches of actually flaking skin. I normally don't have ""flaky"" skin, but I did while using this. It also gave me little white heads that burst when you touch them. Sadly I'm still on the hunt for a moisturizer.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This product completely changed my skin. I never knew that my cream moisturizer was the culprit in my skin getting greasy throughout the day! This gel moisturizer still offers my skin the moisture it needs but it is more breathable and allows for my make up to stay matte ALL DAY. This was a game changer for me and the price point is GREAT - less than what I was spending on a product that was clogging my pores any making me greasy. Who knew!,5,,

Another thing is that I feel like the product itself in the container doesn't last long. Ive been using it for about 2 weeks and I feel like I'm running out already even though I only dip my finger in twice. Other than those 2 cons, it smells great and feels super soft and it does hydrate very well on my nose. So if you have oily skin this is great for you since it's water based and not oil based.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I thought that since this product says its a gel it would soak into the skin and feel very moisturizing.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have tried a lot of moisturizers, and this is nearly the perfect one for day. It feels light, soaks in immediately, feels incredibly hydrating, dries matte, and the effects last. The price point is even reasonable. The ONLY thing I don't like about this is the fragrance. It smells like unbrand hotel room body lotion, and it's strong. I really wish this were fragrance-free to make it literally the perfect moisturizer, but for the price I can deal. This honestly works better for me than Clinique's Moisture Surge did. I would highly recommend, just be aware that this does have a strong, unfortunate scent.

I have been needing something like this for a few weeks now and was hesitant to purchase it based on the somewhat hefty price, but I'm so glad I finally caved. It's light, smells really good and a little bit went a long way, although I kept using it in other areas around my face. I'm kind of obsessed...",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I really like this product. It absorbs quickly which could be good if you don't like that sticky feeling moisturizers can sometimes leave you with.

It's been a cycle of the harsh chemicals, dry skin, and then my skin overcompensating by producing a lot of oil. I am so excited that this moisturizer literally gets sucked into my skin the second I put it on. It smells clean and fresh, not sure why some reviews say otherwise. It's a gel that is slightly watery, so you really need only a fingertip of it, it glides on smooth and you can tell this will last a long time.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I wish this didn't contain fragrance or unnecessary blue dyes... It says it is dye free but it is not. Why do companies add that extra stuff if it's not needed? I'm going to try the gel-cream version since that one is free of both.,3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,It really moistures your skin. It feels soft and refreshed,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Great product for combination skin. Absorbs quickly,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Lightweight gel moisturizer, not a cream. Works really well under make up because it soaks in fast & isn't greasy/oily at all. My combination ""t-zone"" skin loves this stuff. And it doesn't contain any parabens! Only thing that bothers me is how chunky the jar is. It's a huge waste of packaging material for a smaller amount of lotion than it looks like you're getting.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love this moisturizer! It smells great. It feels luxe, absorbs into the skin nicely and doesn't make it greasy or heavy at all. But it keeps my skin which tends to be on the dry side moistured all day long!! It's become my fav daytime moisturizer.",4.4,,

I bought it immediately and have been using it for a few weeks now. It has a cooling sensation once you apply it and absorbs quickly. Once absorbed, your skin is left feeling silky. The smell doesn't bother me nor do I feel it lingers. It does the job at moisturizing without breaking me out or making me more oily. I gave it 4 stars because I'm still on the search for a moisturizer because the skin around my mouth is still dry however I will continue to use this product.",4.4,,

I don't even know how to describe it but it just makes my skin feel like luxurious silk. I have mild cystic acne and I've watched those tiny annoying bumps go away since using this (along with some other new products: nip and fab glycolic fix gel 3x a week at night, the neutrogena transparent facial bar, Dickson a witch hazel toner...but even without those this moisturizer is just great). I kinda wish it came in a pump bottle but it's no big deal. I do sometimes wear Arian oil under this for added moisture but seriously this is my new favorite face moisturizer and I won't use anything else! Highly recommend",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Not sure if this works well or not because I honestly can't get past the perfumy fragrance.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I have been using this product daily for over one year. It is lightweight but moisturizs well without any greasiness.

I think the extra exfoliation from my weekly clay mask has revealed a damaging chemical in this moisturizer.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"When I bought this product, I was on the hunt for a moisturizer that was suitable for oily & acne-prone skin, but didn't have any salicylic acid in it. Though I have oily skin, I still want a moisturizer that makes my skin feel supple and soft, while at the same time does not exacerbate my oiliness. This product did exactly that! I loved it! It feels extremely light-weight on the skin and has a wonderful, slightly cooling sensation. I've used both at night and during the day. It also works fantastically under makeup. It soaks into the skin quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. As a bonus, it has a nice, clean smell to it and I like the packaging - it looks fancy. I would recommend this product to oily skinned people, like me, who want a moisturizer that actually moisturizes. I think it would work very well for combination and normal skin as well. I don't think it would be moisturizing enough for dry skin though.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I struggle with combination skin. Very oily t-zone and extremely dry under eyes (the rest is normal) so I have been struggling to find something very refreshing for my under eyes that will give them some moisture.

Will definitely buy again :),5,,

I use this morning and evening, always after I shower and wash my face because that's when I notice my skin is at its driest. The gel is very cooling and soothing to my skin. I don't have an issue with the smell at all. My face is very sensitive and prone to breakouts on occasion. I didnt notice that it helped to increase breakouts nor did it diminish it. This does not get rid of, diminish, or smooth my pores, but it doesn't promise to do that, just to smooth and hydrate your skin, which is definitely does. Both myself and my boyfriend have noticed that my face is definitely smoother and softer and he loves it. This was a great mosturizer for me to start with and I may try others in the future with other additional benefits.",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"Let me make this clear: My skin is acne prone... VERY acne prone, and gets oily very quickly. And recently I've found that moisturizers actually regulate my skin very effectively and help to drastically keep oil production down. I bought this product as a daily moisturizer to use every morning before starting my makeup routine. I wanted something that would feed my skin moisture continuously throughout the day to keep my skin feeling bouncy, nourished, and soft all day. I wanted something a little less overwhelming than my usual moisturizer for the day time. I thought about getting the Aqua Bomb by Belief, but thought this may be a good dupe. It screamed hydration, and I've heard a ton of good things about it, so I thought I would give it a whirl. Whoo! However, I'm so upset, because it did absolutely nothing for my skin! I don't get it! It's not like I have extremely dry skin either. Pros: I love how it applies. Very cooling, gel like feel that spreads easily so a little goes a long way. Nice! Every day I put it on, did my makeup, and bam, I was out the door. It was only an hour or so into my day when I began to notice it: my skin feels dry... what the heck. Dry? Am I going crazy? I touch my skin and it feels tight and parched. What is this madness!? And all day it felt so dry and awful. Every single day it was like this, and my skin was miserable. Eventually I just gave up, because I couldn't stand it anymore. This moisturizer is just straight garbage and had no business being on my skin, plain and simple. If it works well for you, I'm jealous, because I really wanted it to work, especially for the nice price tag, but I guess it was just too good to be true :(",3,,

I use it morning & night--it plumps up the skin under the eyes to help eliminate fine lines (I'm almost 60) & also works well for decolletage. I live in FL where it's either warm or hot so hate anything that leaves a sticky feeling--this completely absorbs quickly. I'm on my second jar and will definitely continue to use this.

My face turned red, bumps developed that looked like acne all over my face, and massive pimples on my chin. My chin even swelled up because of one of the pimples. It's nothing I've ever experienced before. It felt like my face had been sitting in the sun for hours. So I decided to tried this because I remember using it in the past. I put it on in the car because I couldn't wait and it felt amazing. It feels so cool, refreshing, and doesn't dry my face out (I have combo of oily and dry). Plus it smells really good. My face looked better in just a few hours. It's been a few days and it brought my skin back to normal. I have sensitive skin anyway but it's hasn't felt this good in a long time. I highly recommend this for skin that turns red more easily.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This has alcohol, dye, and fragrance in it. Not good for skin in general. It sank into my dry sensitive skin pretty quickly but it felt as if I didn't apply any product at all. Although it did not irritate my easily irritated skin, I suspect the texture I got the following days were caused by this. Either did nothing or worsened my skin. Returned and am on the lookout for something better. Really disappointed because I love the concept of this line and the drugstore price.",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I'm on my fourth jar of this stuff. I use this twice a day, every day and it feels wonderful. I live in a pretty humid climate so I love how light it feels and how fast it absorbs. No greasiness either. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't irritate it at all. If you have really dry skin then look for the jar that says ultra hydrating because they make two different kinds. Also, for the people saying it doesn't help your dry patches, you have to remember to exfoliate your skin at least twice a week. I will continue to purchase this product. One last thing, it has a very light, clean scent that disappears after it's absorbed.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I love neutrogena products so I was excited to try this. This product smells wonderful and absorbs quickly. I felt like it kept my oiliness at bay for most of the day. The one thing I didn't like was it seemed to sink into my larger pores on my cheeks closer to my nose and when I put my makeup on, my pores were more noticeable than normal and that's a deal breaker for me. I'll be trying another moisturizer because of that. If you don't have pore issues then this is a great product.",3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,Got this for my 16 year old daughter and she loves it! She uses it daily and it helps a lot. She's on the swim team and is constantly in chlorine so it moisturizes without breaking her out! Not only does it help her face but she uses it for her lips too... her lips are always dried and cracked.. not anymore! I think I will get me my own jar soon lol,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"It smells and feels good on my skin, very refreshing but not very moisturizing... I feel my face dry and need to re-apply. And I have oily skin! Definitely not a product for dry skin!",3,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I really liked this product when it first came out. It was really moisturizing and went on smooth....then they changed the product and added this unnatural ridiculous blue coloring and this strangely manish scent. I found these changes to be a major turn off and will look for a better product to take its place.,4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I am on my second jar of this lovely gel I would never want to be without it. I have a terrible oily T-zone and this gel magically controls my oil. It moisturizes and absorbs so nice and the scent is very pleasant. It's the best moisturizing gel I have tried whilst others tend to be way waaay too greasy on my face. Give it a try. ....,4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I hve used pretty much every moisturizer out there and this is by far the best! I have combo/ oily skin leaning more to oily and this is the best on my skin by far!,5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This product has completely changed my skin. I have extremely dry skin and did a lot of research on what would help. I decided to try this and after 2 weeks I noticed the change. Before, my makeup would stick to dry patches and look terrible after a few hours. Since I have been using this day AND night, my makeup looks great all throughout the day. This product is absolutely amazing for anyone who has very dry skin and it's not expensive at all compared to high end products.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,My daughter uses this as her night moisturizer. She loves it.,2,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've been using this for 2 days, I buy most products after scouring reviews, and this one seemed like a winner. It really is! So soft and absorbs right away. You feel clean and fresh and soft alllll day. Nothing greasy, nothing heavy, but very effective. I find myself stroking my cheeks because they are so smooth for the first time in years. I look forward to moisturizing my face! I have combination skin, I can get greasy throughout the day, but I also get dryness and starting to age (I'm 37). I feel like I will wear this for a long time because it's perfectly balanced out my skin already. I like the smell too, very light and fresh.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I was so excited to try this!! Unfortunately, it didn't work for my skin. I put a layer on after I got out of the shower and it felt good for the 1st 5 minutes. Then I felt like I needed another layer. Then another. I have combination skin and it didn't feel hydrating enough for me. Certain parts of my skin still felt very tight. This may be a good option for someone in a humid environment, since it's very light.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It absorbs quickly and lasts all day. Living in CO winters can be extra dry and the summer sun can get to my skin quickly. This has helped my skin recover after a bad face sun burn as well as keeping my skin well hydrated as part of my daily routine. Absolute favorite moisturizer ever.,3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I read that this was a dupe for Cliniques Moisturizer Surge. After buying this after I purchased the Clinique, I have to say for me it is definitely a dupe, and it's a lot less expensive. Both are great products. I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have no problems with this. This is the gel cream which had no smell. The water gel version has a strong floral scent, and it irritated my face.",4.4,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have dry, sensitive skin and never seem to find a facial moisturizer that doesn't get greasy, just ""sit"" on my skin, or irritate it - until now! I have never been a fan of product I had to dip my fingers into to apply - I prefer pumps or squeeze tubes, but don't mind this at all because this product has been amazing for my skin. It absorbs quickly and fully into my skin and doesn't leave behind a greasy feeling. I've only had this for a few days, but I have used it every morning before putting on my makeup and every night after cleansing before bed. I do have to say that if I get this *too* close to my eyes, it does irritate a little, but it is easily calmed by either wiping off the product or blending it further away from my eye.",4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This is my fifth time I've bought it. Me and my husband, yes I said my HUSBAND, LOVE IT!! I have oily skin and he has dry skin and still works wonders for both of us!! I highly recommend this product.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I'm obsessed with this moisturizer! It keeps my skin from being oily in the summer and the dry skin version keeps my skin hydrated in the winter. I've even got my boyfriend hooked on it,5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use it 2 times a day morning and night. But since it doesn't have sun protection I have to layer it with Spf. The gel formula feels cool on the skin. Not to heavy.,3,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I used to use Clinique moisture surge moisturizer until this product came out. I decided to try this because I didn't like splurging $39.00 for Clinique. This is the holy grail of moisturizers. In my opinion, this is a cheaper duplicate to Clinique's moisture surge. I love the gel like texture and the fact that it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy. I have very oily skin and a lot of moisturizers I've used have made my skin greasy and unclean feeling. I also think this moisturizer smells good. Do not hesitate to get this! Just do it.",3,,

Previously, I used Olay for about 12 years before I switched. Nothing was wrong with the old lotion but wow was I thrilled with this water gel lotion. The color and consistency lend to a cool to the touch feeling, a must have in southern Louisiana. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly which doesn't delay my makeup routine.

I have somewhat oily skin and I didn't want something that was too heavy that would grease me up even more. She pointed me towards this and I have bought it ever since. It's a great moisturizer to use after getting out of the shower on a clean face before applying my makeup.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have been applying this morning and night for about a week and it works amazing! I use this in the morning after washing my face with water only, before applying my makeup. The glycerin in this helps my makeup adhere and stay longer all day (which is an added bonus). Then, at night, I wash my face and apply it again. I have combination skin that usually causes me to have to use 2 moisturizers, one for the oily area and another for the dry, but this makes so I only have to use one moisturizer! Keeps my oily from being oily and moisturizes the dry. Will keep using!",5,,

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I've never really been big on applying anything on my face as far as moisturizers or acne treatment creams, because most of them dry out my skin and I tend to peel. but this product is AMAZING!! I really wanted to get something that would moisturize well and work all day, and this definitley does the trick! I clean my face in the evening before bed and after doing so I use the moisturizer (a little goes a long way!) It makes my skin SO smooth and makes applying make up so much easier, it looks more even. I love matte foundation,so this definately helps to not make my skin look overly dry.",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"I have oily, combo skin and was looking for a lightweight moisturizer with spf. I have been using this combined with the eye gel-cream. I really really like this. I am hesitant to say ""love"" because the hot, humid weather has not yet kicked it.",4.4,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,I use this product morning and night. I have very oily acne probe skin. Does not irritate my skin or clog my pores.

Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"This is a great product. So clean smelling. I am so glad I gave in and bought it. Along with leaving your face completely moisturized, i helped with reducing the look of acne scars.

Just great, clean, smooth skin left behind!",5,,
Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,"okay! some said that your face will feel tight after you apply this on. YES IT DOES!! because it is closing up your pores. I also felt it when the first time I applied it on my face, like my whole face shrinks. But i just let it be. after two hours I found that my face does not look oily at all, normally I will have super oily on the T-zone area after two hours applying moisturiser, but this DONT!!!!! instead my face looks healthy and soft. of course, there will be a little oil on my t-zone but i'll just wipe it with oil paper.

I have combination skin, am prone to break outs, and have some pretty persistent dry areas that would not disappear with regular moisturizers that I picked up (I heard about how good Cerave was but, for some reason, it breaks me out every time I use it!) After one day of use this product fixed my dry areas! It does not leave skin oily at all (it actually leaves a nice velvety feel), is very light and refreshing, and smells amazing!

I can say with full confidence that I have never used a better product. My face is so much smoother and softer than it EVER has been, and that is not even the slightest bit dramatic. I would rival my skin with my 3 year olds anytime! I have also always had a small issue with acne and overly oily skin, and some how this product even seems to be managing that. To think that I have picked up this item and put it back a hundred time because, like others I'm sure, I was so over spending a small fortune on another product that says one thing and does another. Worth every penny. Also though it seems like a small jar, a very little bit of this will go a long way!! So happy I bought this, I WILL be recommending this to all the women in my family!",5,,
