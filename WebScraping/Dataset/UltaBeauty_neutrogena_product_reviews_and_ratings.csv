Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I got it because I saw people were getting jt for sensetive skin and used to like the old formula they had.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I had high hopes for this as I'm combo skin, acne prone and a big sweater in the summer. It wasn't gentle. If you use any sort of actives on your skin, this moisturizer won't feel good and just caused irritation. Doesn't moisturize at all. Even wearing in the summer when I don't need much, it felt like this was drying me out. Just because skin is oily doesn't mean it shouldn't be moisturized. Don't waste your money.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I used this moisturizer because it was recommended to me by a friend who also has sensitive skin.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I got suggested this by a very sweet employee for a hydrating face mask. I live hydrogel masks so i figured id give it a try. Im usually not sensitive to sheer masks but when i opened the package i could smell the strong fragrance immediately. After putting it on my face it felt super cooling and i enjoyed it. Once i looked at the ingredients however i saw the fragrance was super high on the list and i got concerned since my skin can be kinda sensitive to scent especially so high in the list. I left it on for the minimum time to be safe but once removed it and my skin touched the air it STUNG and was very inflamed. I immediately washed my face and moisturized and even the moisturizer tingled which meant my skin barrier was disrupted. Its day three after the mask and my skin is doinf way better but i would NOT recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin or honestly anyone to be honest. The cooling sensation was very nice but ill never understand why companies pack skincare with so much fake fragrance.,1

Since starting these products, my face has been so smooth, no reactions/breakouts and I have noticed a difference in my skin overall. I am really hoping the results stay the same after pregnancy. Below is my routine. I wait 2-5 minutes before applying the next product.

It's amazing for me. It is a little pricey for the small amount in the jar, that is my only personal con to this product if you watch your wallet like I do.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This new formula is just not it for sooooo many reasons. It does everything it's not suppose to do. It use to be my primary everyday product I used. Not any more this new formula is simply trash and that's where it ended up.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"This was my go-to moisturizer for YEARS! I loved the way it made my skin feel hydrated without feeling greasy or heavy. Sadly, I will no longer purchase this moisturizer because of the new formula. It made me break out and it gave me dry, red patches everywhere. It also burned upon application! It did everything the opposite of what a good moisturizer should do. They clearly cheapened their ingredients and it shows. Neutrogena, I was a loyal customer of yours for a long time. NO MORE!",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This product is not the same as the old gel cream they used to have. They said that is was just a repackaging but I think they changed the ingredients too. I started to break out and my skin go so dry and itchy after using this product. I do not have sensitive skin either. This product was the only thing that changed in my skin care. I don't like them rebranding and using different ingredients. They took away one of my favorite cleansers in the past too. Don't improve on products that have been doing so well for years!,5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"Over the years I've tried several different hyaluronic acids, some considered more high-end, others more consumer friendly prices. This is the best one I have ever used. It's very lightweight and absorbs in quickly without leaving any kind of residue behind. It really does make the skin look more hydrated and plumped, where others have left my skin looking crepey around my eyes when I would smile, leave a residue, or never really absorbed. There's a reason this brand has such a solid reputation. Other bands rely more on the name, not the quality. This will be my go-to for hyaluronic acid products. I have no reason to look at another brand for a product like this. What's that old saying, ""When you have the best, forget the rest?""",2

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I hate lotions or anything that feels like its trapping my skin with a layer of oil or leaves it greasy. That obviously applies to my face as well. Most moisturizers are heavy, and while they ate effective, they're just not right for me. Neutrogena's Water Based Gel is incredible though! It is extremely hydratinf and plumps my skin, but is almost completely absorbed within minutes. It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth and not like I have a layer of, well…lotion on it. I use a satin pillowcase, and it is dry enough within just a couple minutes to lay down and not feel like I'm sticking to the pillowcase. If you have any sensory adversities to traditional moisturizers, this is a godsend. So lightweight and absorbent. It has a light smell, but its a fresh smell, almost what you would expect ""water"" to smell like, but nothing floral and no strong perfume smell. I've tried several other water-based and they have not given me the same results or the same lightweight feel and absorbency. This is definitelt my #1.",5

As soon as I put it on it was non stop sneezing for about 20-30 minutes. The scent does fade eventually but it is so intense when it first goes on and it was just to much.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I have been using this for over a week now and I have been very happy with it.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"This completely ruined my skin. I'm 17 and before using this my skin was pretty much completely smooth. I'm usually picky with what i use on my face but a family member recommended this to me so i used it without looking at the ingredients (which are awful and filled with silicones by the way) I woke up the morning after using it ONCE and my skin was red, bumpy, and swollen. I haven't broken out like this since i was like 13. I am FUMING. I have no idea how to get my skin back to how it was now, or how long it will take. Like i don't mean to be a Karan but oh my god please don't use this on your face. It would probably be nice as a hand cream or something",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I have dry skin and I got this mask for 'hydrating' my skin. However my skin had never been dried after using a Hydrating mask. It leaves no moisture on face at all. That makes me think if it's only for 'oily' skin,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I liked how hydrating and cooling the mask was. It fits face nicely with it being two pieces. But it was difficult to apply onto face, it came folded and was difficult to unfold and tell which side to apply. Not bad but there's so many other options easier to apply.",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I read a comment on the fragrance being repulsive. Nothing could be further from the truth in my experience.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"was excited to get this because my friend liked it and it was in many articles about moisturizer for oily skin. The first thing i saw was that it had fragrance and coloring in the ingredients. those aren't necessary and it was a red flag right away. even though i used a good amount it left my forehead looking scaly. it made my nose burn and turn red. after a while it was stinging. i washed it off and put my other moisturizer on and it cleared up immediately. the next day my skin was still irritated and i had hives on my jaw and in my nose (i had put extra around my nose because it gets rly dry), and hives on my chin which were very painful and took the elasticity away for that time. neutrogena has never been my friend. i was hopping this one would be different but i guess not. still terrible and frivolous ingredients.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I use this product after washing my face in the morning or night and it always leaves my face feeling super soft.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,Disappointing. Messy to get out of package and put on. Doesn't hydrate. When I take it off my face feels dry. No thank you. Would not buy again or recommend. Price point is good but other then that no thanks,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I love this product so much! I'm addicted to serums, but nothing else I've used has produced such instant improvements in the texture of my skin. I feel like I have 'de-aged' many years after using this.

I use it morning and night (it doesn't take much) along with a few other products that I have been using, like a collagen/peptide serum and vitamin C serum.",4.4

I wasn't sure if it was this product or not so switched off it while my chapping healed, and then gave it another shot. Instantly the chapping came back.

The first thing I noticed as soon as I opened it was the strong Fragrance which I'm not a fan of Due to sensitivities, it feels very refreshing upon application with a nice cooling Affect. After 1 day of using it I noticed my skin was a little More irritated then normal and my rosacea was inflamed, move on to day 2 and my face is completely broken out with a cystic acne Flare up all over my cheeks, jawline, and hairline. My Rosacea is inflamed and peeling in spots. I'm very disappointed in the quality and ingredients in this product Especially coming from Neutrogena a brand we are supposed to trust for sensitive skin. It took me over 5 months to get my cystic acne and RosaceaI calmed and almost completely gone I'm very upset I have to try and do it all over again and this was the only added new product in my routine the other products I've been using for months.I will not repurchase or recommend",4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"You advertise yourself as the epitome of skin care health and well being . I purchased this today . Stupidly - instead of reading ingredients , I was in a hurry and I thought to trust such a reputable brand. My mistake... because when I got home and looked over the ingredient list while unpacking it - this stuff contains 5 (YES FIVE) different types of dimethicone. In fact, hyaluronic acid isn't even listed until the very bottom which means they maybe only put a drop of it per each 100 gallons - I mean seriously that little . But hey, who cares right? With that much dimethicone, your face will look smooth and plump (that is: until u wash it off) . This stuff is about as useful as splashing your face with toilet water and Vaseline and calling it a wrinkle cure. We need to hold our beauty companies to MUCH higher standards. If we can create massive changes in how many shades a foundation can be in... why can't we make them stop lying to us about what we are putting on our precious skin???",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I actually liked this moisturizer, it made my face soft. BUT why did they need to add blue dye to it?? This makes it all the scarier considering that my skin ""soaks"" it up. Regardless of how my skin feels after I use it, this is so unnecessary. Will not be buying or recommending.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This cream is better than most expensive creams. I used so many others and as soon as I switched to this.... Bam oils controlled and face less red. I will make sure to never stray from this ever.,5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"i feel like most sheet masks leave my skin worse off than it was before i used it because most sheet masks have fragrance in them. these have a literal gel sheet, not a fabric/cotton feeling one, and it's fully saturated with product. it's so moisturizing and it's the perfect pick me up that actually stays on your face and doesn't slide off!",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I use this morning and night. It is lightweight and hydrating. Goes on smoothly and has a cooling effect until it dries. It wears great under foundation if you wait until it dries before you put on primer or foundation.,4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"This moisturizer is everything. It's the only moisturizer that doesn't make my skin burn when it's dry or irritated, and it doesn't cause breakouts. I had a big dry patch on my jawline/chin and this stuff took care of it in 3 days. You can literally lather it on and it won't make your skin feel greasy or clogged. I use this in the summer and winter, morning and night. I don't love the price so I tried using a generic Meijer brand that said it had the same ingredients, but it made my skin burn. Neutrogena Hydroboost is the only one for me!",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I love this moisturizer! BUUUUUT, I will not but at ulta again.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This is one of the better face gels I've used. It is very light and a small dab is sufficient in covering most of your face!

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This actually works! Most face moisturizers break me out and do not hydrate any dry areas I have. This didn't make my oily areas worse or breakout and made a noticeable difference on any dry areas I have. I'm so glad I found a moisturizer that works for my combo oily / dry skin that isn't overly expensive or breaks me out! I recommend giving it a try if you're at your wits end with facial moisturizer and give it a go - very friend who has tried it loves it also!,4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,Ok first I have to say it's pretty expensive for neutrogena but it is a great moisturizer. It didn't make my face red like some of the reviews say but I kinda made my face break out a little. I am a teenager so i could have just woken up w hormonal pimples but it was just a little random that I put it on the a few hours later had pimples. I really do think u should try it though because it is a really good moisturizer but didn't quite work for me I might try it again in a few years but for now no.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"At the beginning of the year I had a sudden outbreak of moderate to severe hormonal acne.

Initially I wasn't sure I liked it because it didn't feel like it sunk into my skin. It did not, however, break me out so I continue using it. After awhile it was a good moisturizer that I was impressed by. I am searching for a new moisturizer now for two reasons. 1) The price of this is too high for what you get. I use just a bit on my finger tips in the morning and the jar empties FAST 2) While My skin has improved a lot my pores look HUGE and the blackheads on my nose that were slowly disappearing are now as stubborn as ever.

After applying this just once, I was able to soften my skin up to the point I was able to rub the extra skin off. Disgusting, yes but very satisfying to finally have soft skin again.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I noticed a big difference after adding this product to my skin care routine.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I was really excited to try this with all of the glowing reviews and due to its manageable price point. Unfortunately, this definitely not only broke me out with some deep acne, but also gave me a painful and not so great looking red and scaly rash around my mouth (wasn't just a small rash - it was very obvious). This product was the culprit. I hesitated putting it on my face again after the first time I tried it because the fragrance is unnecessarily strong, and I like scented things. I could smell it for hours after I put it on. Also, the product has dye/coloring in it which seems like just another unnecessary ingredient, especially for a face cream. Lastly, I don't know why companies are still putting products in tubs, especially ones you put on a place you do NOT want bacteria. The only positive about this product was the consistency, which was smooth and easy to spread on your face.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"This is like literally using water on your skin, there is no body, it does nothing for my skin, it didn't live up to it's expectations",5

One tiny little set back is that it irritates me just a tiny bit around my nose and chin but not a lot so that's good !,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I love this product for the summer because it feels cool when you put it on your face and it's great for day time moisturizer but I don't find that it's moisturizing enough for night time since my skin is very dry!,4.4

Since I started using this gel, my face has felt so smooth and baby soft. I have combination skin, and I'll occasionally get some acne and/or really dry skin. Because of this, it took me a long time to find a moisturizer that was super hydrating but not oily or greasy. I tried a few other brands, and they were alright, but this is my ALL TIME FAVORITE! The results are almost immediate; I'll wake up the next morning with super soft skin. I 100% recommend this, and I am NEVER buying anything other than this.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"This product offers a nice almost silky feeling base after applying, however... that's due to the moisture sucking ingredient Glycerin that's very high on the ingredients list. Glycerin creates a soft almost satin feeling texture that can feel moisturizing, however it's actually drawing moisture away from your skin. It also contains dyes and fragrance even though online it claims it doesn't. Maybe the formula changed? I do love the fact this moisturizer is cheap and effective and has Hyaluronic acid, it does work for a lot of people who DON'T have sensitive skin and don't care about ingredients, only outcome.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This moisturizer feels amazing when you apply it! I love the water consistency of it and it doesn't leave my face feeling oily.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"So I've used this for a couple weeks now and I'm not sure this is compatible with my skin. I have oily skin, it's a little sensitive but I don't really breakout much, I don't have acne issues. I mostly wanted something to help with aging as I'm in my late 30s and with my oiliness. But this is actually making my face itch and feel more sensitive. As if I exfoliated too much or something. It also burns as I apply it. I know with any irritation, it's time to stop using the product. I think it's a great gel for oily skin as it doesn't make my face more oily and my makeup sits well on top of it. But I'm too old for itchy face and the possibility of acne. So it's a no for me. If you have acne issues I'd say Neutrogena is a great and affordable for step. But if you don't have acne, this might be too strong and too irritating. I really have to send this back.....fast.",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I have ridiculously sensitive fair skin with rosacea. I hate the feeling of lotion on my skin. I sweat a lot and specially right out of the shower. My skin just doesn't want to absorb lotion and it drives me crazy all sticky and wet for 40+ mins. So I've been trying all the gel and oil moisturizers. This one is the best! You apply is and instantly your skin drinks it. I can put makeup on minutes after i apply it. I use to have to skip moisturizer under makeup because it would just sit on top of my skin. This moisturizer has change my skin healthy and my makeup game! All my makeup looks and applies so smooth now!,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"This moisturizer is amazing! I used to work for Lancôme and have tried many high-end moisturizers and this one is actually my favorite so far, I've been using it for a few weeks since my Energie de Vie ran out. I have combo skin that gets oily in the summer, but this is lightweight and manages to keep my skin feeling hydrated and supple without being greasy. It smells great too, a very light clean fragrance. I recommend it to everyone now 😊",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This is a great basic moisturizer. I don't like the fragrance. If fragrance doesn't bother you then you should definitely try it!

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I bought this since I've read such good reviews about this product helping those with dry sensitive skin but soon realized after using it that the next day my skin felt even drier and was flaking! I even had small little acne happening around my chin where I'm the most driest at.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I thought I was going to love this because my friend swears by this and has beautiful skin. I thought since I have combo skin this would be good because I'm not too dry or too oily. However, every. single. time. I use this moisturizer I breakout with big under-the-skin pimples. I gave this product many tries because I thought the pimples were caused by something else but I'm certain this is the reason. I hadn't gotten any big pimples on my cheeks for months and the second day I used this one popped up, so I'm pretty positive this is the cause. Definitely super disappointed and will not be using this ever again and would NOT recommend to anyone who thinks they have sensitive skin.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I bought this product a few months ago before Christmas. This product worked so well for my skin. But, overtime it stopped and caused my skin redness and dryness. It made my skin feel stripped. This was a very good product at the START! But, as I used it more it stopped working. I have very sensitive so when I seen it worked for me I was so proud but then it stopped and I found another moisturizer that works well!! But, if you have sensitive skin... you could give it a try... but it may not work for forever!",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I use the cleanser and serum from this line with no issues. But the serum wasn't quite enough for mu dry winter skin, and the bottle suggest following up with this. I started to break out in pimples right away after using this just a few times. I don't have many breakouts, so it was easy to narrow it down. I stopped using it for a bit and my skin cleared right up. Tried it again and had the same results. I can see that the product does have the potential to be a great moisturizer if you get lucky enough to not break out from it. But I can't wear it even once without zits. And I don't typically have any breakouts at all. So unfortunately this was a waste of money for me.",4.4

Because of it's wonderful consistency, it feels so refreshing and it really absorbs quickly, so simply the feeling of putting it on your face is just so nice and doesn't feel gross like putting on a lot of other really heavy moisturizers. It keeps skin feeling pretty nice and moisturized throughout the day without feeling really heavy or greasy. I only wish it was cheaper and gave you more moisturizer in one container.",5

It kept popping up around my nose, chin, and eyes. I'm sure we've all had an annoying mask that we had to readjust every ten seconds- well this was one of them. I was tired of it after like, 5 minutes, and threw it away. That was a third of the time you're supposed to wear it, and my face didn't feel any different when I took it off. I was definitely not psyched about it.",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I used to use this moisturizer and it was the first one I ever found to be effective for my super oily, but somewhat dehydrated, skin. I made it almost the whole way through the jar, but it always gave me a little bit of a tingly sensation, so I decided to discontinue use. Upon further investigation, it unfortunately appears that I have a sensitivity to hyaluronic acid, so I couldn't use this or any of the other products in the line, but it did generally work as a moisturizer for oily skin, so I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who doesn't have ridiculously sensitive skin like me. (BTW, for anyone who does, the replacement I found that worked great for me is the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel. Not the lotion+, not the oil control gel, though that might work great too, haven't tried, and definitely not the hydrating jelly, as that also has hyaluronic acid).",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"The mask hydrates well-if you can get it on and keep it on. The backing was half falling off the mask as I was pulling it out of the package, and the mask was so slippery I had to slide it back up my face until it dried a bit (so it's tacky enough to stick). Neutrogena is very generous with the serum, though. I am frugal so I continued to use leftover serum in the package a few more times the following days. I like to cotton masks better than this slippery gel substance.",4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I love this, seriously. I'm incredibly picky about moisturizers and I have finally found the one. I first bought the little travel size to try it out and just bought the full size. It's super hydrating, you can tell it actually absorbs and doesn't sit on top of the skin. The reason I bought in the first place is because I think gel moisturizers feel way better than creams which run the risk of being greasy even if they're oil free. Becuase of that I believe it would work for every skin type. Since I've incorporated this into my skincare routine my skin in smoother and has a more even tone. It's even healed up a weird flaky dry irritated patch I had near my chin that I couldn't get rid of. This is the holy grail and its not very expensive!! You won't regret this!",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This is an amazing dupe for Clinique moisture surge.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This is the best sheet mask I've ever used and I'm at the point now where I won't use any other one. The mask comes in two parts so it fits your face comfortably and doesn't slide down over time. The hydration is unbeatable.,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I've been using this for over five months and I've definitely had better moisturizers. My combo skin soaks it up within seconds and is still dry afterwords. I have to apply it several times in one session in order to notice a difference. Even though the price is moderate compared to other moisturizers, I think cheaper stuff works better in my opinion.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,Honestly is one of the best face masks I've ever used. Only downside is getting it out of the packaging. It's really sticky.,3

I've gone back and forth with types of projects similar to this (some sort of water cream like this with Hyaluronic acid). LOVE THIS ONE! It is a little bit more money at ulta than the similar products, but this one is the best yet. Doesn't burn my skin, and without it for one night and morning my skin felt so dry. I realized this really really helps dry skin!!",4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I love this product except for the scent. Too strong of a fragrance! I use products that are fragrance free as different scents/fragrances bother me. I continue to use this product anyway because I like what it does.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I absolutely love this mask! My skin is extremely sensitive & I break out from just about any little thing.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I ordered this moisturizer because the winter weather in my area is very unforgiving. On top of this, my apartment has poor air circulation and we use a gas heater, so our air gets very dry. I have a combination skin type. I get patches of dry and oily skin. My boyfriend on the other hand has very dry, sensitive skin. I was looking for a product that we could both use. This product is amazing for both of us. This is my first full day of using it, but I can already tell I love it. It isn't greasy and a little goes a VERY long way. I love this moisturizer because I can tell it's for all day wear. When I first put it on, I didn't feel much of a difference, but throughout the day my face has gotten very soft and supple. My dry patches are gone! My boyfriend said his face hasn't felt this good with a moisturizer in a long time. He has very sensitive skin and he can usually tell right away if something will be irritating because it'll burn. He hasn't burned all day and also feels that it improves throughout the day. When it arrived in the mail, it seemed a little small. I was a little discouraged. But I only needed the tiniest dab to cover my entire face and neck. Same with my boyfriend. Since it's a little pricey we plan to take turns purchasing this product. I love that it fits both of our very different skin types so well!",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,My brother and I both used this product. He's been using it for years and have very dry skin. He recommended it to me since he likes it so much. He also has sensitive skin but he's never had issues with it. I started using this in the summer because my regular moisturizer was too heavy as I have combination skin that gets oily in the summer.But I quickly realized something was wrong with my skin. Whenever I put the product on the smell was overwhelming and my skin felt irritated and slightly burned. It took me a while to realize this product was causing irritation and my skin wouldn't stop breaking out. Finally stopped using the product and switched back to my old moisturizer and my skin has calmed down significantly.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,There is plenty of serum in the packet but seems most of it stays there instead of sticking to the sheet mask. The mask itself slid around and did not adhere well to my face. I kept it on for the minimum 15 minutes and then applied the remaining serum from the packet 3 times (lots of juice) before finishing my routine. The serum is very light and hydrating with a light scent. It was great for my oily skin but I won't be repurchasing because the mask is too much of a hassle.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,Love this mask. It quenches my dry skin and makes it smooth afterwards. A must try mask for everyone to try.,4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I bought this and the serum at the same time, and I noticed how quick it absorbs into the skin.

However, I noticed how matte my face would look afterwards and it still feels a bit tight and dry. After about a week, I've noticed these tiny whiteheads that are popping up near my nose and mouth, and I don't breakout there or have these particular breakouts. At first i thought it was the fragrance, because the product is HEAVILY fragranced. As I got to looking at the ingredients, and one of the biggest/highest ingredients is dimethicone! I really wished this worked for me, but with the fragrance, dimethicone, breakouts, and not moisturizing, I just cant recommend this.",3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This mask is wonderful. Does everything it claims to do. But the WORK i have to put in tp get this mask on is kind of annoying only because its a 2 piecer and if your not Careful the serum that saturates the mask will drip out immediately. ( i like to save the extra to rub in after) this is not a multitasking mask and what i mean is you cant be walking around doing whatever else with this on because it will slip and move. So i suggest if you have the extra 10-15 minutes to just lay down and relax while waiting for this to work its magic then go for it ! But if your looking for something you can quickly slap on and move on then this isnt the one .,5

I invest in my skincare, but the most expensive isn't aways the best and, likewise, the most affordable isn't bad in and of itself.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I have oily skin, and I've tried many high end moisturizers and nothing worked. A friend referred this product, so I decided to give it a shot. Not only does this product leave your face feeling refreshed without the oily feeling, it also brightens and clears acne! I use this twice a day after I clean my face, and I can not believe the results!",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,Love how it goes on. Does not last even when used with other Neutrogena products. Tried using along with Wrinkle Expert day/night moisturizer and is a little better.,3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This stuff is amazing,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,It moisturizes without feeling heavy.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,Not sure why this is marketed for dry skin because it's not hydrating. It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling tight no matter how much I apply. I also think it's breaking me out probably because my skin is trying to compensate for the lack of moisture. The only positive is that this didn't cause any irritation for my mildly sensitive skin. I feel like this product would only be good for oily skin if anything. Will be returning.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I have dry/combo skin and this really didn't do anything. Didn't really hydrate or make my skin feel nice. Only reason i am giving it two stars is because it smells nice.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"This product is super light and airy once you blend it in your face. It just melts into your face, and it smells clean and fresh!!!! It does have a leftover residue, but I just blend it in into my hands and wrist!",4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I've seen people say they got a reaction from this product which is definitely valid, it is not for sensitive skin. but if you have dry skin this product is amazing. dont expect any long term results, this mask is just packed with hyaluronic acid and will make your skin feel hydrated, refreshed, and plump for 8-12 hours. I use it in the AM when I wanna go without makeup and I love how it feels all day after. definitely recommend!!",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,Love it.,3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I have used this mask once. Still too early to truly evaluate effectiveness. The first application was nice however skin did not feel as moisturized or awakened as it has with other products. Will definitely try a few more times.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I have extremely oily skin and could never find a moisturizer that didn't make my skin tacky and slick. I tried this and it's my favorite. It moisturizes just enough but not so much that my makeup skids off within the hour. I could see how this wouldn't be enough for someone with dry or combination skin, but for someone whose skin never seems to dry out, it's a lifesaver.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I bought this out of recommendation from a dermatologist.... yikes. The instant I put it on my face, my skin dried out. I didn't think anything of it. I thought it absorbed nicely. Until I started to feel my skin and it was covered in bumps. I thought it was my face wash, so stupidly, I tried to add a little more... cue the actual visible sight of redness and bumps breaking out across my skin. I had to cleanse and remove the lotion, and find another moisturizer for it to finally calm down. While this doesn't have many ingredients, I've never had an allergic reaction to a skincare item, and this did NOT sit well with me. Be very aware of the ingredients that are in here, and approach with caution. Definitely patch test before you indulge, unlike me, who went all in, and my skin is still bumpy. :(",4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This product spreads easily on my skin and it doesn't look oily and it doesn't have that greasy feel like a cream does.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I love this product! It's so nice and makes my skin feel hydrated. What isn't making this 5 stars is it isn't very long-lasting :/,3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I love this mask as a pick me up to refresh and hydrate my skin. This mask has a very interesting jelly texture and feels great when applied, I'm not that amused at the fact that it has two separate pieces, as you have to figure out placing for these masks to stay on without falling off. I'm not a big fan of heavily scented face products this particular one isn't as strong as any of the other hydro boost products. I love putting it in the refrigerator for 10 mins prior to use. I like to use this mask in the morning but does work very well at night layered with thicker night creams. These masks have a lot of extra serum if want to get more bang for your buck you can pour the leftover product into an empty serum bottle and use a couple more times. I highly recommend the purifying and brightening masks in this same line.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"It felt good on the skin and was definitely moisturizing but made me break out... I do love the body lotion they make, but it's kind of concerning they have the same fragrance.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I would love this product more if it didn't contain dimethicone. It can clog pores especially with acne prone/oily skin. And i do have that problem, but the hyaluronic acid really does moisturize the skin.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This makes my skin feel so good. I get dry patches and this helps get rid of them literally over night. I was a littler concerned about it being a gel texture but it's great. I also love the way it smells. I have sensitive skin but I didn't have any issues with this product.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I've recently been using the Clinique 72 hour moisture surge, and I heard this product was a dupe. Once I ran out, I purchased the hydro Boost water gel and regretted it soon after. I should've tried the hydro Boost cream instead. Unlike the cream, the water gel has fragrance in it which in my opinion completely ruins this product. I have sensitive skin. Sometimes, this product will cause my skin to burn but that's mostly only when it's been going through the gigs (wind burn, sun damage, dentist appointment lol). Anyways, I can never use this moisturizer alone as it doesn't give me enough moisture. That really sucks because this moisturizer isn't cheap. Either way, I will give the hydro Boost cream a shot once I run out of this tub. This product does have some positives and could be really nice if you have oily skin. I am very acne prone and this didn't break me out. It is super lightweight and not greasy. Additionally, it does a really great job at smoothing texture thanks to dimethicone which isn't the awful ingredient that some people make it out to be. It's actually beneficial but can create the illusion of more moisturized skin.",4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I love neutrogena and I was curious to try out this product. My skin is normal, no acne, not oily or dry, but when I tried this product out I noticed it would cause redness in my skin and tiny little red bumps. I'm not sure what in the product caused this but i had to throw out the whole collection I had bought.

I have struggled for YEARS to find a moisturizer that actually works and won't break out my skin, or make it more oily. Using this, has helped my skin so much, because it hydrates my skin and doesn't break me out, and it isn't oily. Many complain about the scent of it, but it isn't bad. It almost smells kind of tropical or like some type of detergent- I don't really know how to describe it. The texture feels kind of like a primer, so it's not super creamy like other moisturizers, but it is not heavy at all!",5

For me, as an extremely oily, dehydrated, sensitive, acne prone gal I struggle to find products that work for my skin. I'm Korean so I naturally always gravitate towards k and j beauty products. They work better for my skin. Over the last few years I've struggled with cystic acne so I have to be really careful with what I put on my skin. I try to look for non-comedogenic products to avoid further breakouts. I read a really great review on this product from an article I found on pinterest after searching best products for my skin type. The reviewer's review really checked all the boxes off my list for what I was looking for so I reached for this right away. I was so pleased after trying this. Experienced no breakouts, pore blurring results and sat super well under make-up. I never had any issues with dryness and felt this product plumped up areas like smile lines. I'm always on the hunt for something better with everything I use, so I'll try something different for a bit but I keep finding myself coming back to this product. I've tried really expensive to not so expensive moisturizers trying to find that HG, but I honestly think this product may be that for me. I've been using it for 3 years now and once I leave, I always come back to it. This is the one moisturizer I've repurchased the most because I love it that much. It really stinks to read it hasn't worked for other folx, but as someone who struggles with most products, I really hope Neutrogena doesn't change anything about this one and I hope those can find something that works for them too.

The one thing that I will say is that I'm very disappointed in the way that the other products in this line work. I purchased the water gel with the sunscreen added and it was HORRIBLE! I also purchased the city shield and had terrible results. I suppose it depends on each person and their skin.

It is oily/acne prone, but super sensitive so I never know what I can and can't use. I have been using this in the am and pm now for months! Even under my makeup it is perfect. It is not greasy and my skin feels so soft. I put this on in the morning before my primer and it is perfect! In the evening I do my night routine and put this on to sleep and perfect! The one thing that I will say is that I'm very disappointed in the way that the other products in this line work. I purchased the water gel with the sunscreen added and it was HORRIBLE! I also purchased the city shield and had terrible results. I suppose it depends on each person and their skin. I did love this product enough to try and get the whole line, but this is the only thing I've found that I can stick to and actually works amazing. I can't go without it!",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I like this moisturizer and I've only been using it for a short amount of time. It has made a difference in the presence of dry skin. Love!!!,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I have a problem with dry skin. I used to wear foundation and see that my skin was peeling underneath. After every shower and face wash, I use this and my face feels sooooo smooth. A little goes a long way. If you put too much you can actually feel it on your skin but with the right amount you can't feel it. Now that I use this, I don't see anymore peeling underneath my foundation.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This broke me out so bad and I've never experienced a product breaking me out. After a week and half of use I noticed all these little tiny bumps on my cheeks that looked like white heads or something and I put a face mask on and it made them stand out SO MUCH they looked huge and my pores were HUGE I was so scared because tbh I have clear skin and get minimal pimples so this was new and I knew it was this moisturizer because it was the only thing I changed from my skin routine and I wasn't on my period. This wasn't for me I guess even though to heard it was great I'll pass.,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,Its very cool to the touch and lightweight on your face! Definitely love it. I will definitely buy it again. And ive got tons of products in my bathroom but this one is one of my favs. Doesnt break my fave out or make it feel oily. I was skeptical at first because nothing seems to help but this one is fantastic. I now own all of the neutrogena city shield and hydro boost creams and serums,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"Amazing. I've used the Hydro Boost gel sheet mask on a regular basis before purchasing this, so I knew what to expect for the smell, which doesn't bother me at all. The product melts right into your skin, leaving a smooth, natural finish. I originally purchased the trial size, but once it's gone I will be buying the normal size.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This product is SUPER hydrating but I noticed when I use it I get small pimples in the middle of my forehead.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I really wanted to like it but as soon as i got it on my skin started feeling itchy and irritated. As soon as i took it off my kin was red and had small bumps on my cheeks. Definitely not for sensitive skin.,5

I was prepared to spend more (and I have) but though ti would give this one a try and it was fabulous! I have been telling everyone about it.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I have oily/combination skin. This moisturizer is great for oily skin, especially in the morning under makeup, but it's not quite moisturizing enough for the dry patches I get on my chin/cheeks, so I have to use a different heavier one in the evenings.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I have combo/oily skin, and this has worked WONDERS for me. One of the few moisturizers that don't make me an oily mess or break me out. However, it smells VERY perfumey. I don't usually have issues with fragrance, but I get terrible headaches every time I use it... Until I find a replacement (why must the fragrance free version be for dry skin!!) I'll be taking some tylenol while putting this on lol",3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I am in my early 30s and have been struggling with my under eye appearance (looked dull and lacked elasticity). I purchased both the moisturizer and eye cream (Hydro-Lift) and OMG....the skin under my eyes no longer sink in and look so supple and hydrated!! I absolutely love this product and can't wait to go back to the store to purchase additional Hydro-Boost products!!!,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I feel like this is trying to be a dupe for a popular water sleeping mask of a similar color and scent, but it misses the mark. Instead of smelling light and fresh, it smells strongly like a bathroom air freshener. If you have sensitive skin or are bothered by fragrance, stay away from this product! I could maybe forgive the overuse of fragrance if it worked well, but it's honestly too lightweight for my skin type and feels slightly drying. This may be better for oily skin types, but my dry/dehydrated people should probably look elsewhere. Not worth it, especially for the price.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I already used the daily cleaner and daily moisturizer in the skin care line and while waiting to check out at the dollar store I found the mask. That's right folks not a high end, over priced pharmacy or department store but a good old affordable dollar store. Sittung at home one afternoon decided to try it , did not even use mirror to get it on perfectly. Kept it on for 25 min. and the refreshing, healthy , youthful glow after use can't be missed.",1
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I have severe dry skin. No matter what I use it seems like it is never ending. I've used this mask several times now to make sure it truly works and it does. My skin feels so much better after using this. The mask is somewhat like a gel that has a ribbed side to help keep it on your face. I leave it on until it is dry. My skin is so smooth and luscious for days. Great product.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I've been a long time neutrogena fan and this does not disappoint. It feels amazing on your skin and really does plump it up.

I got good results with SOS Caudalie Serum, but Neutrogena water gel is half the price and does the same thing. I have ditched all other moisturizers. I only cleanse my face morning and night and use the Neutrogena water gel at night. My skin is very smooth, bright, dewy and suddenly, after a few weeks of this routine, my chin is CLEAR! For the the first time ever. Yes, I recommend!",3

I regret buying this completely and I have great skin but my concern is the dryness. Around the 4th-5th day of using this I woke up to a burning red face with a prickly rash all over my forehead, cheeks, chin, everywhere. My skin looks CHEMICALLY burned. My cheeks are burned to the touch and the rash all over my forehead is disgusting. After doing a lot of review reading I learned I wasn't the only one with this reaction. Please don't take the burning sensation as ""it doing it's job"" on the first tries. I will never go back to this product, and will stay away from Neutrogena forever.",5

I did my research on what to do and how to fix it on a budget. If I'm going to be using this every day, it will obviously need to be repurchased somewhat often. I tried Dove first (did absolutely nothing) so then I found this... I am OBSESSED. It actually cleared my breakouts on my chin somehow. My face is SO smooth and I feel like I did before my skin got bad! Yes, the smell is strong, but I don't think it's a bad smell. I actually like it. This has quickly become my absolute favorite.",5

I re-applied after an hour - still too dry. The next day I tried again and even my husband commented my skin was red and asked if I was feeling well. I tested some on his face and the same thing happened - dry, rough patches except his were also itchy. Rinsed it off and our skin felt better plain, without it.

My nose has large pores and I get blackheads on a daily basis but the SIZE & darkness of these blckheads is crazy! It looks like somebody dotted me with an ink pen. I even get huge blackheads on my cheeks from this which I don't typically have blackheads on my cheeks. Unfortunately I just can't use it anymore.

Then it's split in two. So the top part was stuck to the bottom. I understand the concept of why they split the mask. But maybe out a divider in the packaging. Like the tonymoly strawberry nose strips. Or even just made it a full mask. It was it's to much of a hassle to put on. Then it had the mouth and eye flaps. Those where awkward as well and made it even more difficult to put on. I don't think I'll buy this again. I'll try the over night gel mask instead. It was just to much of a hassle to put on,5

I am always hesitant to try drug store brands but this is amazing. I usually would drop alot of money at ""the other store"" for a product like this.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I have combination skin. This will not moisturize a lot. I think this would be perfect for people with only oily skin. If you have dry skin you will still feel dry after applying it. Feels good when you first apply it though.,5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This feels great going on and my breakout prone kids with oily dehydrated skin love it.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,So I love this moisturizer because it's a dupe for Beliefs Aqua bomb. It has the same feelings and cooling sensation.

So I apply this and it feels awesome.,5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,You need this,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I love this type of mask. I have acne prone skin that gets very dry during the winter. This definitely helps without causing extra breakouts. It can be messy when you open the package from the liquid on the mask.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I would just use one pump of this on my face every day and I just kept noticing my face getting more oily. I saw no beneficial effects after using it for almost 5 weeks.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,This stuff is... AMAZING!! I recently had a bad skin reaction to a mask I did so my face was SO dry. I'm talking like patches of dry flaky skin. I applied this 3 times a day for two days and the dryness was gone. A little goes a long way with this product which I enjoy. Highly recommend and will be buying again!,2
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I have added this to my everyday routine. I love it I think it's a dupe for the H20+ Oasis Hydrating moisturizer. I love the Hydro Boost Line sm.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"My husband's dermatologist recommended this product. He tried it and loves it. Now it's all he will use. I always keep an extra on hand since he goes through it so quickly. Thats the thing, the gel is so light that it absorbs very quickly and you use more of it. Overall, I would recommend this product.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I generally have oily skin but its more combination in the winter months. The daily moisturizer that I use works so well at minimizes oil that it leaves dry patches around my chin and forehead during the winter months so I supplement it with this moisturizer at night and it works great for me. It does take more than a few minutes to absorbs but it does make your skin feel super moisturized. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone with oily skin for summertime though.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I have now used this twice & I LOVE it. I'm a big fan of the Hydro Boost line. I have the moisturizer, the eye moisturizer & the fragrance free lotion. I love em all.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"The only thing I don't like is the container. I hate cosmetics that come in these pots. It is difficult to get all of the product out. If you have nails and are sticking you fingers in to get the moisturizer out, some of it always ends up under your fingernails. Pot is also heavy for travel. Container looks great, but not convenient at all to use.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I don't write reviews, but MY GOD this stuff is amazing! It's literally like heaven in a jar for my skin. I have combo skin, oily in my t-zone and normal on the perimeter. This instantly hydrates my skin without the greasy feeling. The best way to describe it is almost like putting water on your face and letting it soak in. Can't find any other moisturizer to replace it! My absolute FAVE!",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,Love this moisturizer! Curology recommended it so I decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. So light weight and it feels like heaven when you put it on. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate it at all. My face feels hydrated all day after using this. Definitely recommend!,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,Great product for daily use in the winter months for moisture.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I bought this because I heard such amazing things about it. I had to stop using this because of a burning sensation and irritation of my skin. I can not recommend this product! Buyer beware.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"Those with sensitive skin should stay away from this product. I have sensitive skin and it is always difficult to find something that won't irritate my face. I really wanted to like this, but my skin broke out very quickly after use. I don't usually have terrible break outs but this caused really painful cystic acne. Disappointing.",4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"Was finally getting my skin under control (extremely sensitive/acne prone) and I decided to get this moisturizer to complete my regimen. After a week of use, it completely reversed the condition of my skin, caused redness, itchiness, and even nodular acne. The product does not feel right when applying and feels plain gross when it sets. Do not recommenced",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I absolutely love this moisturizer,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I actually don't mind the smell and I am a big smell person. I thought it worked great for my dry skin, especially for this time of year. I do think it's a bit slippery, although it does stay on your face once you get it on. And I wish it came in 1 piece instead of 2. I also think the flaps for the eyes and mouth holes are kind of a waste. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this product! I have a slightly oily t-zone and really dry skin in the winter around my mouth and chin. It helped clear it up! Would buy again.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I love this product! I was buying and trying all sorts of expensive brand products(for hydrating my skin), none of them were working for me! I have combination dry skin and I also have really bad year round allergies. The winds dry my skin out really bad. I use this day/night before my serum and moisturizer. It really hydrates my skin without making me look oily.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I love this light oil free moisturizer. I have pretty oily skin but have dry spots as well. I use prescription retinol at night so I have to be careful not to use anything with oil in it which will cause skin irritation. I use the moisturizer and wait about 10-15 minutes before applying the retinol. It's perfect. No irritation and I get the hydration my skin needs especially when using the retinol. I feel as if this has actually helped with the oil production. Great product!,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I have acne prone, sensitive skin that is not really dry or oily. I use a very gentle cleanser like Cetaphil or Cerave and then I like ro use an oil free moisturizer. I have been trying many different kinds and found this hydro gel on sell and decided to gine it a try. So glad I did! There is a slight pleasant smell at first but it goes away quickly, which I like. It gives my skin just the right amount of moisture with no residue or breakouts at all. My skin feels so soft and comfortable. I just love it. Finally found something that works for me.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I've used many different moisturizers and none have worked quite like this one. My boyfriend and I both use it daily - it absorbs extremely quickly and leaves our skin silky smooth. I apply it every morning after my shower and before makeup. My skin has gotten drier as I've shifted into my late 20's and it's really the only moisturizer I've used that immediately gets rid of that dry/flaky feeling and never makes me break out (which is an issue I've dealt with in the past)! LOVE it. Definitely give it a try!,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"This is a repurchase for me; I love this line of products! The hydro boost water gel is light weight, applies well and offers great hydration. I began using the hydro boost gel about a month ago, no, I did not run out of my first jar but I don't want to run out and not have a spare. Since using, I've noticed my under eye area is not as dry and the rest of my face is well moisturized with less texture! I use hydro bossy gel in the morning and at night.",4.4

Do not recommend if you have sensitive skin unfortunately.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I buy two every week to add to my weekly facial routine. The formula is deep penetrating and works even better with the cream mask from the hydro boost line.,3

I knew my moisturizer was making me break out this way, but I kept using because my skin is so ridiculously dry. Out of desperation, I bought this gel on a whim, and it WORKED. My skin is dry enough that I sometimes need a second or third application, but it never ever makes me break out or feel greasy. Skin as soft as anything and calms my overheating and redness. Even though its a little out of my price range, I'm investing in this again. Really really worth it. Only complaint is the ""smaller on the inside"" concept. I ran out of this stuff pretty quickly.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,Laura Lee did a review of this product and I decided to check it out and I'm sure glad I did. I was super skeptical about it because I'm used to using Clinique Moisture Surge. This hydrates my skin and absorbs quickly without leaving behind any residue. I ❤️ using this after a mask. This product doesn't last long for me but it's not too expensive compared with similar products with similar ingredients.,5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I used to love this product when I didn't have acne in the summer but once I moved south my skin got way more oily and way more acne prone.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I was put on this product as part of a skin care regime for some issues I was having. It is AMAZING!

It's so hydrating and slick, but it's not oily or thick or anything like that. It leaves my skin looking absolutely beautiful every time I use it. I've used this moisturizer regularly for the past year and a half and I've definitely noticed a difference in my skin. My skin is brighter, glowy, smoother, and I've even noticed my acne isn't as bad since throwing this in my daily regimen. This product is honestly my holy grail!!!!",3

This batch (with the fragrance and dye) has such a strong, masculine scent that I don't think I will purchase it again. I don't know why skincare (facial especially) is fragranced at all. The smell is just so strong and not a good choice for sensitive skin. I also don't understand why there is so much packaging for this. The container is huge for a small amount of cream, and then it comes in a huge box!

My entire face broke out through our the first day of wearing this ( the other products that I've tried from this line haven't had the same results at all ) I wanted to love it, and I hate that I don't, but I definitely would pass if you're looking for a good sun screen that doesn't clog your pores.",5

After using this moisturizer, my makeup looks smooth and I haven't experienced any of the strange flaky/oily phenomena.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I have very oily skin and have been looking for a moisturizer that would keep my skin hydrated without enhancing the oils in my skin. The moisturizer I was using before this one did just that and was on the pricier side. I bought this after hearing such great reviews thinking it would be perfect for my skin while being more affordable. Unfortunately after a couple of weeks I noticed my skin was beginning to feel very tight and dry patches started to appear on my cheeks. I have since stopped using this product and gone back to my old moisturizer and doing this alone has brought my skin back to life.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"Fragrance usually isn't a problem for me, but with this product, I think it was just too much. It's a fine moisturizer - light, non-greasy, although it didn't seem to last very long and it took a while to absorb - but if you have sensitive skin, I recommend steering clear, especially if you're sensitive to fragrance. It has a very strong scent and left a slight burning sensation when first applied. A shame, because I really wanted to like this one! For something similar that didn't give my skin any issues, try Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+. Much more sensitive skin-friendly.",5

I walk to and from the train station to get to work each day and this gel has been great against the elements and does not cause me to break out.

Once I started having more bad flare ups on my cheeks I thought I'd give this a try since it has SPF. I put it on one day and the next suddenly my dryness was gone. My skin feels great and it has helped my makeup look a lot better. If they made a jumbo size I'd purchase immediately.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I used this before I went to sleep and I woke up at 5 am the next morning with very itchy skin, so I went into the bathroom and saw that I had broken out with red bumps all over my face. I have dry and sensitive skin so I really wanted to like this mask, but I would definitely not recommend if you have sensitive skin.",3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I've been using this product for several years now. I know that everyone's skin is different from the other but I absolutely love this. I loved it even more when I was pregnant and was using a cheaper, different product. I wasn't working and thought I would save money and not have to buy this...wrong. It's worth getting. The other product dried my skin out and left dry patches all over my face. I went back to my water gel and it cleared up in just a couple days. This product is on my ""stock pile"" list.",1

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I really like this product! I am really into beauty products but I don't know as much about skincare. I was using a very expensive moisturizer and when I ran out I needed a more budget friendly option- and this is it! I replaced my moisturizer with this (although I am not entirely sure this is a moisturizer per say?) When I use this and my daily cleanser religiously, I found my acne cleared up a lot! It feels a tiny bit sticky on the skin when first applied but I am so glad I found this product- it's high end quality for low end price!",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I was looking for a moisturizer that is great for dry skin but also water based because I use a water based foundation. Any moisturizers meant for super dry skin are not water based but since I use a water based foundation I needed a moistuzier that wouldn't cause any chemical conflict but still help my super dry skin. This did the trick.,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I have been on various acne pills for months & regularly see a dermatologist. My skin has transformed completely over the past year. However, right after I started using this product my entire face broke out completely.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,Use to use a high end face lotion that eventually turned into $50 and would no longer do the job. Tried this one and will never go back. A bit pricy for the amount you get though.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"This was an amazing hydrator and instantly cooled my face. It was so refreshing, however, I am disappointed in the actual ""mask"" part. The two pieces do not bother me, but the mask is so frustrating to put on! I've had other gel mask that have not given me as many problems as this one has. It kept rolling off my face, even if I slightly tilted my head from a completely flat position to see what my phone was buzzing about or to get more comfortable. Be prepared to do absolutely nothing with this mask on, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, however is not fun when you're always doing something like me.",4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"This is the best gel formula I've used. I have dry and sensitive skin, so usually most products irritate it and do nothing to help my dry patches around my nose. One application of this, completely rid me of my dry patches and most of my redness. I've been wearing it for 5 hours and my skin is still feeling hydrated. I wanted to wait before reviewing because it is very new to me, but I couldn't wait since it has been so amazing. There is no strong scent, it didn't irritate my skin, it smoothed out dry patches that have been on my face for months, and it has a great cooling effect. I finally found my holy grail water gel and plan on trying more of the Hydro boost line. Highly suggest for people with dry skin!!!",4.4

I used it for a few months, hoping my skin just needed to get used to the moisturizer but it kept getting worse. As soon as I quit using this product, I stopped getting cystic acne and my skin is finally clearing up again.",2

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I recently decided to start taking care of my skin, I know, super late to the party! I have dry skin and had not been taking care of my skin properly for years. I was recommended this product to help clear up my dry flakes and patchiness to get me on the right track. I have been using this for 2 weeks now and absolutley love it! The first two times I used it, it kind of stung a little but nothing too crazy, I decided to give it a week of twice daily use and i could not be happier that i stuck with this product. It feels great and unlike some, I enjoy the smell. My skin feels SO SMOOTH after applying and it super quickly absorbs. It feels like an ice cold glass of water for my face. I will say that it still tingles a very little for like 5 mins when applying, but I believe it is because of the hyaluronic acid that is doing its job. I combat this MINOR tingling by applying a few sprays of Mario Badescuon rose water.",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I guess it's my fault for not checking the igredients before I bought it. There is no use for fragrance in face products and the fragrance with this one is strong and overpowering and therefore is NOT suitable for sensitive skin types.

It just has the worst old lady perfume smell! I did try it once, just to test it out, and the smell does sort of go away after a while, but it's just not worth it.

However, when it absorbs into the skin, my skin feels dry and as if I did not moisturize at all. I wanted to like this so badly because I have oily skin and I needed to try a water-based moisturizer. I will most likely never repurchase because I feel as though there has to be another water-based moisturizer that will feel more hydrating and replenishing!",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I am really liking this but I'm still a little too dry after I put on a small amount so I'm applying it twice and it helps. I think my skin is just more dry than usual with the weather changing too frequently but I feel like I'll love it during summer. Might get the thicker one for the winter months next time.,4.4

I have combination skin and get really dry by my chin and cheeks and when I put this on I saw results the next day. It defiantly feels like you're putting water on and I get oily on my nose and forehead so I was nervous that this would make it worse, it doesn't! Before you know it it soaks into your skin and it makes it softer instantly. For the price, you can't go wrong with this!",3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I love this sheet mask! It doesn't break me out or upsets my super sensitive skin and it really hydrates it! I only use this once in a while when I feel like my skin needs a little extra help and the price is reasonable. Only thing I don't like about it is it comes in two parts- one sheet from the nose up and one sheet from nose down. I think it should just be one cohesive sheet and it's kinda annoying. Overall love it though and such a great product!,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I was an avid user of Clinique Moisture Surge for years. The price point was a bit high, but I found it to be more effective and less greasy than traditional face lotions.

I can use this product at night and in the morning without clogging of pores or a greasy feeling. It is also long lasting, so it is worth the price.",4.4

I sometime will even use it before putting on my night cream if I feel I need a little extra hydration. If you like the clinique moisture surge gel, you will love this.

I have combo skin, andI've been a little dryer lately... so the first time I used to before applying my make up because i had a lot of dry patches and flakiness, once i removed it... oh my Gods, I had ZERO dryness, my skin was alive again! and it made my face look so healthy and fresh all night long... with out making it greasy, it's not greasy and not really ""dewy"", it's hydrating and that's what i love about it. The second time was after a long day of wearing makeup and being outside, so after i cleansed my face my face felt so dried and dead so I used my mask and like JESUS OF NAZARETH IT CAME BACK TO LIFE. so I personally find it... amazing! The only cons are that It IS a little messy, but with these results... who cares? I cold flood my house and I wouldn't even care. And it's nothing you can't clean up fast. And the other one is that it is quite slippery so you might need to rest while you use this mask, but i promise you, it's all ALL worth it.",3

However, since I have combination the areas outside my t-zone are dry, especially now since it's getting colder. It doesn't moisturize some of my dry areas, including around my mouth and parts of my cheeks, well. I have to use a heavier cream to moisturize these parts. This isn't terrible, considering gels aren't meant for dry skin. However, for the price, it would have been nice if worked in my drier areas. Maybe this product will work well all over the face for people with oily skin, but combination and dry skin types should proceed with caution. I'm giving it four stars because the product worked well in summer, but not so much in colder temperatures.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I've waited to try this because I have so much skincare that it's overwhelming to introduce something new into my routine - I tend to waste a lot as it is. My skin type: skin tone, light to medium; fine lines, enlarged pores, combination/oily skin with dryness around my eyes (my entire orbital area) if I don't consume plenty of water and moisturize properly. I follow a strict beauty routine that includes different cleansers for morning and night. I double cleanse after I wear makeup and use specific serums and moisturizers in the morning and then use separate and different types of serums and moisturizers at night. My morning routine includes a stabalized Vitamin C Serum combined with a Serum to lock it in, followed with a light cream for my cheeks and nose; a cream for the rest of my face, an eye serum, then 2 heavier eye creams. My nighttime routine is similar only I use an AHA and BHA, then heavier serums and creams with pure sqaulane oil, then a heavier gel moisturizer to lock it all in. It works for me and keeps my skin balanced. I'm conscientious of all ingredients in Skincare and makeup. Although my skin has oily areas, I would rather be super moisturized than dry. I do what I can to prevent deep wrinkles. Because I have spent so much money on skincare products with rave reviews, I waited to buy this. I've been eyeballing it since it was introduced to the consumer. The list of ingredients would leave one to believe that this moisturizer would be great; however, it managed to break my face out, leave my face feeling like I had a something as heavy as Pond's cold cream on, yet made my face and neck peel ALL over. I had no smooth areas for over a week and that's been with me taking desperate measures. My skin has started to repair, but thanks to that whole buy one, get one 50% off (this should have been a red flag) I now have two jars of this cheap junk that I don't even want to give to anyone. Heads up! There's is better products for less $$.",5

The moisturizer is a really nice, smooth, gel texture and it does have a strong scent, which I really liked but I can definitely see it being a problem for those sensitive to scent. I didn't notice the smell lasting throughout the day though, only when I first opened the jar. The gel felt nice and cool on my skin, but I don't feel like it really absorbed into my skin or provided much moisture, just kinda sat on top. It is definitely non-greasy, but after a couple weeks of use, I had one of the worst breakouts of my life, and ultimately returned the product.",5

I put it on morning and night and it makes my skin soft, radiant, and hydrated. I have combination skin and it is perfect for me.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I purchased this product to replace the costly UD rehab gel. When comparing the feel of the two products, they are comparable. When comparing the application of these two products, the UD is thinner on the skin and absorbs quicker...Hydro Boost has more of a glycerin feel when applying but does absorb nicely, they both leave your skin feeling soft and supple, and ready for makeup application. When comparing the scent of the two products, Hydro Boost does have a more dominate smell, but it's pleasant! I prefer the lightweight gel over traditional lotion moisturizers and I'm happy I gave them a try. I have oily skin with dry patches on either side of my nose/mouth, these gels help decrease the mid-day grease you get with traditional moisturizers! Please give a gel a try....either UD or Hyrdo Boost...you won't regret it. When reading other reviews, please keep in mind that everyone's skin reacts differently, and everyone takes care of their skin in different ways.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"It's a great product, but not really for dry skin. I have dry skin except for my nose which get quite oily. Whenever I apply the moisturizer on my face, it doesn't moisturize well besides my nose because it's oily. The rest of my face still feels a little dry, like I want to apply another moisturizer. Another thing is that I feel like the product itself in the container doesn't last long. Ive been using it for about 2 weeks and I feel like I'm running out already even though I only dip my finger in twice. Other than those 2 cons, it smells great and feels super soft and it does hydrate very well on my nose. So if you have oily skin this is great for you since it's water based and not oil based.",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"At first I thought that this was going to be more like a thick gel but it turned out to be a very nice and smooth gel. It absorbs very quickly for when you have dry skin and it does feel a bit heavy (kind of like make up) but not that bad. It does seem like you would half to pay a lot of money for a small container and that is true because the container is pretty small, but it REALLY does work.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I have combination skin and this stuff rocks!

I do see a lot of complaints about the smell but I actually love it, it's very refreshing almost like a glorified very fresh baby powder smell. This moisturizer also helps my very oily skin build-up, when I wake up in the morning usually my face is extremely oily, but with this there's almost no oil and makes me skin extremely soft.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"I have tried a lot of moisturizers, and this is nearly the perfect one for day. It feels light, soaks in immediately, feels incredibly hydrating, dries matte, and the effects last. The price point is even reasonable. The ONLY thing I don't like about this is the fragrance. It smells like unbrand hotel room body lotion, and it's strong. I really wish this were fragrance-free to make it literally the perfect moisturizer, but for the price I can deal. This honestly works better for me than Clinique's Moisture Surge did. I would highly recommend, just be aware that this does have a strong, unfortunate scent.

And trust me, my skin is not easily pleased.",5

It has a cooling sensation once you apply it and absorbs quickly. Once absorbed, your skin is left feeling silky. The smell doesn't bother me nor do I feel it lingers. It does the job at moisturizing without breaking me out or making me more oily.

But as with most products containing spf, it leaves a shine on the face that I don't like. It's also not as refreshing as the gel in the jar and doesn't seem to be as moisturizing. Bottom line, if you need an spf I suppose this is OK, but I prefer the cool feeling and moisturizing results from the non-spf gel in the jar more--just wish they'd put that in a pump.",4.4

I do love the feel of this product, I use it in both my morning and night skin care routine. It absorbs quickly clear, and feels cool. Also, very important, it applies smooth like butter. Sadly, the jar is big so don't get your hopes up, you are not getting a ton of product. It's like a bag of chips, all air. Thankfully, it's good air (or I wouldn't have bought a back up already). It's easy to grab too much product, so just dab your fingers in, and then add more if needed.",5

And recently I've found that moisturizers actually regulate my skin very effectively and help to drastically keep oil production down. I bought this product as a daily moisturizer to use every morning before starting my makeup routine. I wanted something that would feed my skin moisture continuously throughout the day to keep my skin feeling bouncy, nourished, and soft all day. I wanted something a little less overwhelming than my usual moisturizer for the day time. I thought about getting the Aqua Bomb by Belief, but thought this may be a good dupe. It screamed hydration, and I've heard a ton of good things about it, so I thought I would give it a whirl. Whoo! However, I'm so upset, because it did absolutely nothing for my skin! I don't get it! It's not like I have extremely dry skin either. Pros: I love how it applies. Very cooling, gel like feel that spreads easily so a little goes a long way. Nice! Every day I put it on, did my makeup, and bam, I was out the door. It was only an hour or so into my day when I began to notice it: my skin feels dry... what the heck. Dry? Am I going crazy? I touch my skin and it feels tight and parched. What is this madness!? And all day it felt so dry and awful. Every single day it was like this, and my skin was miserable. Eventually I just gave up, because I couldn't stand it anymore. This moisturizer is just straight garbage and had no business being on my skin, plain and simple.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I'm always on the lookout for products that actually WORK so had to try this when my sister recommended it. I use it morning & night--it plumps up the skin under the eyes to help eliminate fine lines (I'm almost 60) & also works well for decolletage. I live in FL where it's either warm or hot so hate anything that leaves a sticky feeling--this completely absorbs quickly. I'm on my second jar and will definitely continue to use this.

I clean my face in the evening before bed and after doing so I use the moisturizer (a little goes a long way!)

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,I use this product morning and night. I have very oily acne probe skin. Does not irritate my skin or clog my pores.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,Purchased this hoping it would help my dry skin. It made it much worse. Very disappointed since I'd read so many great reviews. I had to use an additional moisturizer on top of this.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"This is a great product. So clean smelling. I am so glad I gave in and bought it. Along with leaving your face completely moisturized, i helped with reducing the look of acne scars.

Just great, clean, smooth skin left behind!",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer,$26.99,"okay! some said that your face will feel tight after you apply this on. YES IT DOES!! because it is closing up your pores.

But i just let it be. after two hours I found that my face does not look oily at all, normally I will have super oily on the T-zone area after two hours applying moisturiser, but this DONT!!!!! instead my face looks healthy and soft. of course, there will be a little oil on my t-zone but i'll just wipe it with oil paper. I've been using this for three weeks now. My pores are all closed up and yea less oily face. Breakouts still have but not much.",4

No way.... It is instantly absorbed into your skin and your face feels dry, not moisturized. At first I thought I had to put some other product over it. Nope. It was a waste of $18. I'm going back to my moisturizer and I won't trust Neutogena again - they aren't accurate in their claims.",3

I would rival my skin with my 3 year olds anytime! I have also always had a small issue with acne and overly oily skin, and some how this product even seems to be managing that. To think that I have picked up this item and put it back a hundred time because, like others I'm sure, I was so over spending a small fortune on another product that says one thing and does another.

I really only got this for the hyaluronic acid. It makes my clear skin feel pretty soft and look really even, but if I ever get any of it over a breakout or broken skin, it seems to make the breakouts worse. That being said, it's great even for very sensitive skin, if you are careful with it. If your skin is totally clear, just dry, the gel is good for locking in moisture and evening skin tone. If you have any breakouts, it's best to let those heal completely before getting any of this gel on them.",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I got suggested this by a very sweet employee for a hydrating face mask. I live hydrogel masks so i figured id give it a try. Im usually not sensitive to sheer masks but when i opened the package i could smell the strong fragrance immediately. After putting it on my face it felt super cooling and i enjoyed it. Once i looked at the ingredients however i saw the fragrance was super high on the list and i got concerned since my skin can be kinda sensitive to scent especially so high in the list. I left it on for the minimum time to be safe but once removed it and my skin touched the air it STUNG and was very inflamed. I immediately washed my face and moisturized and even the moisturizer tingled which meant my skin barrier was disrupted. Its day three after the mask and my skin is doinf way better but i would NOT recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin or honestly anyone to be honest. The cooling sensation was very nice but ill never understand why companies pack skincare with so much fake fragrance.,4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This product is not the same as the old gel cream they used to have. They said that is was just a repackaging but I think they changed the ingredients too. I started to break out and my skin go so dry and itchy after using this product. I do not have sensitive skin either. This product was the only thing that changed in my skin care. I don't like them rebranding and using different ingredients. They took away one of my favorite cleansers in the past too. Don't improve on products that have been doing so well for years!,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I can't fully comment on how this affected my skin because I took it off immediately after I put it on - the SMELL, my goodness, the SMELL. If you're sensitive to strong fragrances, this product is not for you.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"This gave me the worst acne I've ever had. Looking at the ingredients now it makes sense because it has Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Olivate, Laureth-7 and fragrance. Yikes!! I would not recommend this to anyone who deals with acne.",2

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,My skin is both sensitive and prone to adult acne. This is a perfect moisturizer for my skin. I usually use Clinique Jelly. This is very similar but I think it is a little more moisturizing. Non-irritating and doesn't break me out.,3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"The original was a holy grail. There's a def change in formula. The new version has def changed the color, texture, fragrance, it absorbs slower. And makeup slides a lot faster than before.",4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I used this product along with the gel cream for years and both formuals have changed and they are ruined.

Except the backing snt really stuck to the gel mask, so it doesnt come out of the package in an orderly fashion. Mine didnt have eye holes or the mouth part cut out, and the mask itself was too small for my (average sized) face. Fail for me. Especially for the price.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I love this for daily use, in the mornings, after what ever serum I am using. It absorbs well so is great under makeup. It's probably not moisturizing enough on its own though.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,If they ever discontinue this I wont recover this. This literally saved my skin as someone with really oily skin this helps my makeup stay on all day. Ive tried the fragrance free version amd its just not the same.

I have combination/oily skin and this really left my face dry. I was shocked because it was summer and I sweat alot. I didn't see any real benefits at all from it after using it for three months and all.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I like this product! It certainly did not cause me to break out, which is huge because a lot of moisturizers do. However, it did not moisturize as well as I hoped it would. I have very dry skin, and had been using Kiehls Ultra Facial Cream prior to trying this. I was hoping this would be a less expensive alternative, but after about 6 weeks of using this, I am definitely starting to get a bit dry again. This product also doesn't last nearly as long as Kiehls UFC, so back to Kiehls it is!",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"This is my go-to when I can't get my hands on the Loops beauty masks. My face feels very hydrated after I use it. I also like the brightening results I get when I apply makeup afterwards. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because of the fragrance. If you have sensitive skin, I recommend patch testing first.",4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,honesty i have been looking for something to compare to clinique moisture surge since that has been my go to for sooo long but ts just so expensive so i looked into this brand. when i tell you i honestly may even like this better... it trult leaves my skin feeling super hydrated without a heavy oily feeling. its so lightweight and feels like nothing while making my skin look super glowy and just amazing. highly recommend this.,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"Over the years I've tried several different hyaluronic acids, some considered more high-end, others more consumer friendly prices. This is the best one I have ever used. It's very lightweight and absorbs in quickly without leaving any kind of residue behind. It really does make the skin look more hydrated and plumped, where others have left my skin looking crepey around my eyes when I would smile, leave a residue, or never really absorbed. There's a reason this brand has such a solid reputation. Other bands rely more on the name, not the quality. This will be my go-to for hyaluronic acid products. I have no reason to look at another brand for a product like this. What's that old saying, ""When you have the best, forget the rest?""",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I found this product years ago and have repurchased time and time again. My skin is always plump and hydrated with this product.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I wanted to try this since I heard it was a ""dupe"" for the clinque moisture surge moisturizer line. It isn't a terrible product, but it's not anywhere close to as moisturizing as the Clinque product is and it has a strong chemical smell.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"Literally, hands down, best moisturizer. Just get it and at least try it. I have combination skin, oily tzone and dry everywhere else. It doesnt break out my tzone and keeps me hydrated. I have tried COUNTLESS of moisturizers. I've been using this for a year now, I haven't found anything better than this.

I used to have to apply so much powder on my nose to try and hide my oil. BUT since using this it has balanced my skin so well!!!

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"i was really hoping i would love this product, because most of the reviews are very good. my dry skin did not like this prpduct in the least, and after applying it, it made my face feel like it was burning. it made me very red, and caused some flaky dry spots on my face.",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I hate lotions or anything that feels like its trapping my skin with a layer of oil or leaves it greasy. That obviously applies to my face as well. Most moisturizers are heavy, and while they ate effective, they're just not right for me. Neutrogena's Water Based Gel is incredible though! It is extremely hydratinf and plumps my skin, but is almost completely absorbed within minutes. It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth and not like I have a layer of, well…lotion on it. I use a satin pillowcase, and it is dry enough within just a couple minutes to lay down and not feel like I'm sticking to the pillowcase. If you have any sensory adversities to traditional moisturizers, this is a godsend. So lightweight and absorbent. It has a light smell, but its a fresh smell, almost what you would expect ""water"" to smell like, but nothing floral and no strong perfume smell. I've tried several other water-based and they have not given me the same results or the same lightweight feel and absorbency. This is definitelt my #1.",1

Definitely lives up to the hype.",4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"The formulation of their gel cream products is phenomenal. However, yesterday I returned the regular Hydro boost because I opened it to be blasted in the face with headache inducing fragrance. I don't even know why you would put fragrence in a face cream. Then today I just used the cream gel for hands, and again with the fragrance. And it is strong. I have no idea why these things have fragrance in them, but I have to return this as well because I have hand eczema. Please, Neutrogena, stop with a fragrance. It is not necessary and it is a major irritant.",4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I randomly found this holy grail about 6 years ago and it is my all time favorite. I use it before special events or when I want my skin to look and feel really good. Its so hydrating and it feels so good to have on, does not burn at all. I recommend using it for the full 30 minutes, that way it really absorbs the moisture and you only have to pat in a little excess at the end. 10/10 would recommend",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have been using this for almost 2 years and this stuff gave me the worst cystic acne I have ever had. I didn't realize this was causing it until about a month ago after I tried every medicine and topical from the derm and nothing was working, I decided to try switching my moisturizer and sure enough my skin cleared up almost immediately. I haven't had a single pimple in almost a month and this was the only product I changed from my routine. also if your skin is flaky dry this will do nothing for you.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,It's not a perfect product. The mask could fit my face better. If you're looking for a little dose of hydration in addition to your daily moisturizing routine this is a great option. However when I traveled to a drier climate I used one of these to try and help my skin adjust to the lack of humidity and it didn't do too much to help my overly dry skin. Lathering more of my regular moisturizer on seemed to work better than this in that case.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I decided to try this. Using for one week and love it so far. Lightweight yet hydrating with a nice scent,5

I'm not exaggerating either. My skin is very sensitive and this absorbs well, leaves my skin very soft and hydrated. I only cleanse and apply it (i use it at night) and wake up with perfectly hydrated skin. NOT OILY, doesn't burn, doesn't smell weird, easy to use. I even bought one for my boyfriend! I loved it. I can't even add any cons.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"This is just glycerin and various silicones, it really just sat and gave me break outs. If you read the ingredients they aren't good, I wish I would've looked first because for the price there are MUCH better products.",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I've used this for a couple years now and I've always loved it. Maybe I just got so used to it I never really appreciated it. But lemme tell you. I ran out of this for almost 2 weeks. I just did not have time to get to the store for it between work and kids and busy life. My skin took an absolute beating. I was still using the rest of my skincare, just not this. I started breaking out horribly and my skin felt so dry and gross. I got some before work and put it on in the car and my face came back to life in about 2 minutes. It felt so good on my skin and it already feels and looks better.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"It was cool at first but I noticed over time that my eyes developed a rash (I use a few products so I didn't know this was responsible).

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I love using this mask. It hydrates my skin and leaves my irritated skin feeling soo supple. What some people don't realize with hyaluronic acid is your skin needs to be damp in order for it to not dry your skin out and use a cream afterwards.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I've been looking for a new moisturizer for a while now. Honestly I've been looking for one that wasn't super pricey but still good quality.

I couldn't even put on makeup because my face was so dry, to the point of sloughing off, like a bad sunburn... I googled the best options for very dry skin and this came up. I started using the Hydroboost wipes and this gel once at night... Four days of using the product and my dry skin has almost completely cleared up! I highly recommend it. The scent is light.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Purchased the travel size as a tester and will be purchasing the regular size. Keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day. Only down side is that is dries down a little tacky but it goes away with time.,4.4

I have been using it in the morning for about 3 months and my face doesn't get as oily throughout the day- it's very light weight and clean!

I paid entirely too much for this to of only been able to use twice! The first application it did what I thought it would, made my skin feel soft. I was hoping for a deeper hydration but was still okay with it. Day 2 I noticed how dry my skin was when I woke up so I applied again and it instantly started burning. By day 3 my skin is 100x more dry than before I started using this product and now I'm red and patchy as well sooooo.....this turned out to be absolute garbage for me!",3

My skin also seemed drier which does not make sense if it is supposed to be a ""hydrating 100%"" mask. I used lots of soothing products to get back to a somewhat normal skin barrier for like a week. Maybe my experience has something to do with the fact that there is more fragrance than Hyaluronic Acid in the product. Just because I had a bad reaction doesn't mean you will, BUT when Neutrogena is very misleading saying ""Non-comedogenic formula is gentle on dry skin and won't clog pores"" WHEN THE PRODUCT HAS MORE FRAGRANCE THAN HYALURONIC ACID. please do better neutrogena",3

I was impressed with how quickly it absorbed into my skin until it started to tingle and burn. I also started to get these dry patches by my eyes and my makeup did not look great on my skin anymore. My skin started to turn red in some areas and was overall not happy with the change in routine. I thought that it would be very moisturizing, but every time I used it it felt like I had swam in a chlorine pool for hours as my face felt so tight.

I actually store this in my mini fridge that I use for skincare and it feels so refreshing and cooling upon application! And I find that it smells really nice. Like most moisturizers, it doesn't absorb immediately but I find that it absorbs rather quickly (by the time I'm done getting ready, it's all absorbed).

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I found this moisturizer totally ineffective for my naturally very dry skin. I take vitamins every day and drink 1 gallon of water every day as well because I exercise every day. This product really did nothing for my skin. However, I found it was great to add to any of my foundations to create a more natural and sheer coverage without it tampering with the formula of the foundation. That may be because the formula is very very watery, but if you need something like that for your foundation, I'd recommend using this, but only for that purpose. I used the entire jar and did not change anything else about my skin care routine. Luckily it did not cause breakouts or irritation, so it's sensitive skin friendly it seems! If you don't have very dry skin naturally, maybe this would work just fine. But for the price per oz, I'm not at all impressed",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have used this product two times now, and both times after using it you can see the difference in your skin. I especially recommend this for people who have dry skin. My face was glowing after this, but of course you should use this at least once a week.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,So I bought this in hopes that it would eliminate the dry skin from my facial. I was peeling pretty bad around my chin and temple from the facial I had Tuesday before Easter. Hydro boost is amazing and turned my flaky skin to smooth and hydrated extremely fast! I love the smell and the outcome is worth the buy!,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This peel and place mask really makes your face feel plumped with moisture in just 15 minutes.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I love this moisturizer!! It works great for my dry skin and it feels very cooling. My only problem is that the prize keeps increasing.,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"This completely ruined my skin. I'm 17 and before using this my skin was pretty much completely smooth. I'm usually picky with what i use on my face but a family member recommended this to me so i used it without looking at the ingredients (which are awful and filled with silicones by the way) I woke up the morning after using it ONCE and my skin was red, bumpy, and swollen. I haven't broken out like this since i was like 13. I am FUMING. I have no idea how to get my skin back to how it was now, or how long it will take. Like i don't mean to be a Karan but oh my god please don't use this on your face. It would probably be nice as a hand cream or something",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I seriously love this stuff so much. Love the entire Hydro Boost line.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I got the travel size of this, as I do with anything new I want to try, and I'm glad I did. I have been looking for a cheaper option than the dermologica calm waters gel as I have pretty sensitive skin. I tried it over 2 days, morning and night and Overall it didn't turn my face red which was great, and it really made my face feel great but I couldn't use it every day due to the unfortunate scent. As soon as I put it on it was non stop sneezing for about 20-30 minutes. The scent does fade eventually but it is so intense when it first goes on and it was just to much.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have been using this for over a week now and I have been very happy with it. My skin tends to get a little dry in spots, and I wanted to try a moisturizer that wasn't thick. This is the perfect mix of lightweight and hydration!",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have oily/combo skin so I was concerned at first since it's supposedly catered towards dry skin.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I hate the greasy feeling it leaves, I hate the way it always has a smell to it, and I hate how expensive they are! BUT, this moisturizer? This is a life saver!!! Oh my goodness, it has no after feeling, so light weight it literally blends into your skin almost like butter but without the thickness! It has no smell, a little how's such a long way and it's actually aided in my chronic dry skin!!! I've only been using this for 3 days but already I see a HUGE difference",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,i really like this moisture and how it applies because my skin is oily and this is heavily recommended by lots of dermatologists and such. but this stuff makes my face BURN when i don't have sensitive skin whatsoever. i think it even made me break out. even my old ponds was better than this. the search for a perfect moisturizer continues...,3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I have dry skin and I got this mask for 'hydrating' my skin. However my skin had never been dried after using a Hydrating mask. It leaves no moisture on face at all. That makes me think if it's only for 'oily' skin,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I liked how hydrating and cooling the mask was. It fits face nicely with it being two pieces. But it was difficult to apply onto face, it came folded and was difficult to unfold and tell which side to apply. Not bad but there's so many other options easier to apply.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"it's a moisturizing mask, but on the heavy side. It comes in 2 pieces: one for the top portion of my face and one for the bottom half. The bottom half kept sliding off.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have only used this for one week and it has already changed my skin dramatically, i suffer from acne and let me tell you my face is so smooth now. Perfect for oily skin, this is a must.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I read a comment on the fragrance being repulsive. Nothing could be further from the truth in my experience. It has a very light, pleasant fragrance, that disappears quickly as it melts into my skin. My skin feels moist without being sticky. What more can you ask of a moisturizer? Will purchase again.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"Apply after Aha cleanse, toner in am, & after a midday shower",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"was excited to get this because my friend liked it and it was in many articles about moisturizer for oily skin. The first thing i saw was that it had fragrance and coloring in the ingredients. those aren't necessary and it was a red flag right away. even though i used a good amount it left my forehead looking scaly. it made my nose burn and turn red. after a while it was stinging. i washed it off and put my other moisturizer on and it cleared up immediately. the next day my skin was still irritated and i had hives on my jaw and in my nose (i had put extra around my nose because it gets rly dry), and hives on my chin which were very painful and took the elasticity away for that time. neutrogena has never been my friend. i was hopping this one would be different but i guess not. still terrible and frivolous ingredients.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"This product came recommended by multiple people, so I wanted to give it a try! I have combination skin that tends to get reallyyyyyy dehydrated in the winter, especially under my eyes and on my cheeks, and I was desperate to increase my skin's hydration. This moisturizer did wonders the first few times I used it, but one morning I woke up with a swollen eyelid and red, itchy, dry skin. (I hadn't introduced anything else into my skin routine or into my home during that few days, so it had to have been the moisturizer that caused the reaction.) I had to take medicine to stop the reaction (though it was a very minor reaction in the scheme of allergic reactions, so don't be too concerned). The ingredient list for this does not look super agitating and has some good elements, so I'm not sure exactly why I had this reaction, but I unfortunately won't be using the product again. That being said, I think it could just be a personal sensitivity of mine, so I don't want to entirely blame the product. But if you have even slightly sensitive skin like I do...maybe don't use it. Or at least start out by using it on a small patch of skin for a few days.",3

It's lightweight and dries quickly. The best part is that it's not oily at all and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I bought the travel size first as a trail and loved it so I ended up buying the full size. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lightweight face moisturizer.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Disappointing. Messy to get out of package and put on. Doesn't hydrate. When I take it off my face feels dry. No thank you. Would not buy again or recommend. Price point is good but other then that no thanks,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I love this product so much! I'm addicted to serums, but nothing else I've used has produced such instant improvements in the texture of my skin. I feel like I have 'de-aged' many years after using this.

I loved how 'wet' this product felt when I applied it, however, I started forming rashes/chapping easily on my face where I had dry spots. I wasn't sure if it was this product or not so switched off it while my chapping healed, and then gave it another shot. Instantly the chapping came back. Definitely pretty disappointed I couldn't finish the jar. Will have to give it another try in the summer when it's less dry.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have really oily skin, so I feel like moisturizers are either too light, or leave my skin extra oily. This is neither of those!

I loved the consistency and it helped my skin feel moisturized without a greasy feeling that I get with most other moisturizers. However, it has a very strong scent that I couldn't get over. I usually don't mind fragrance in my skincare products but this felt like applying fabric softener to my face. If this were unscented I'd totally buy again, but as it stands, I won't be repurchasing. I definitely recommend it to someone with oily skin who doesn't mind stronger scents, however.",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I bought this mask because i have very dry skin in the winter and need a boost of hydration here and there. this was not it. first, it was extremely wet and slippery when taking it out of the package. it is divided into two parts but the white backside just slips off and confusing which side to put it on. after leaving it on for 30 minutes, my face was not as dewy as i was expecting considering the packaging was so wet. all in all, not worth it.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have really dry skin, and I've tried all kinds of low end and high end moisturizer. This has become my favorite so far.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I have combination skin with an oily t zone and dry everywhere else. I decided to give this a shot as I have been searching for a new moisturizer and my skin LOVES it. It absorbs into my skin right away and doesn't make me me oily throughout the day like other moisturizers have done. Definitely try it out even if you do not have dry skin! This has been a game changer to my skin care routine.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I love this product. It works well for my sensitive and oily skin. The gel doesn't overload my skin and cause breakouts. I love a good priced water based product.,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I bought this a year ago, and absolutely loved it. Super hydrating, but not thick. Goes on smooth and does not leave you feeling greasy (despite drenching your skin in moisture). LOVE LOVE LOVE. Only downside is that it looks like Neutrogena has switched up the formula since then... I was quite disappointed with the new version. (Though if you never used the old one, you'll probably still love this. I just know what it used to be... *sigh*.) Why fix it if it isn't broken?",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"My sister suggested me this product cause I was looking for a good moisturizer. I use it every morning after face wash and it leaves the skin looking hydrated and plump(smells good too). Once a day is enough. The only con is the container looks big from outside but after opening it , the inner holder is hollow and smaller, hence less quantity.",3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"Okay so I really wanted to like this, but this was one of the worst Purchase I've ever made. I picked this up as a temporary replacement for my Clinique moisture surge after hearing it was a dupe. It does not compare in any area except maybe the overall texture of the product itself. The first thing I noticed as soon as I opened it was the strong Fragrance which I'm not a fan of Due to sensitivities, it feels very refreshing upon application with a nice cooling Affect. After 1 day of using it I noticed my skin was a little More irritated then normal and my rosacea was inflamed, move on to day 2 and my face is completely broken out with a cystic acne Flare up all over my cheeks, jawline, and hairline. My Rosacea is inflamed and peeling in spots. I'm very disappointed in the quality and ingredients in this product Especially coming from Neutrogena a brand we are supposed to trust for sensitive skin. It took me over 5 months to get my cystic acne and RosaceaI calmed and almost completely gone I'm very upset I have to try and do it all over again and this was the only added new product in my routine the other products I've been using for months.I will not repurchase or recommend",3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"You advertise yourself as the epitome of skin care health and well being . I purchased this today . Stupidly - instead of reading ingredients , I was in a hurry and I thought to trust such a reputable brand. My mistake... because when I got home and looked over the ingredient list while unpacking it - this stuff contains 5 (YES FIVE) different types of dimethicone. In fact, hyaluronic acid isn't even listed until the very bottom which means they maybe only put a drop of it per each 100 gallons - I mean seriously that little . But hey, who cares right? With that much dimethicone, your face will look smooth and plump (that is: until u wash it off) . This stuff is about as useful as splashing your face with toilet water and Vaseline and calling it a wrinkle cure. We need to hold our beauty companies to MUCH higher standards. If we can create massive changes in how many shades a foundation can be in... why can't we make them stop lying to us about what we are putting on our precious skin???",1
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I actually liked this moisturizer, it made my face soft. BUT why did they need to add blue dye to it??

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"One of the best hydration masks I've ever used. The fact it's two pieces took some time to adjust, but the end result (I did 30 mins) is SO worth it!",3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I was really excited to try this with all of the glowing reviews and due to its manageable price point. Unfortunately, this definitely not only broke me out with some deep acne, but also gave me a painful and not so great looking red and scaly rash around my mouth (wasn't just a small rash - it was very obvious). This product was the culprit. I hesitated putting it on my face again after the first time I tried it because the fragrance is unnecessarily strong, and I like scented things. I could smell it for hours after I put it on. Also, the product has dye/coloring in it which seems like just another unnecessary ingredient, especially for a face cream. Lastly, I don't know why companies are still putting products in tubs, especially ones you put on a place you do NOT want bacteria. The only positive about this product was the consistency, which was smooth and easy to spread on your face.",3

One tiny little set back is that it irritates me just a tiny bit around my nose and chin but not a lot so that's good !,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I love this product for the summer because it feels cool when you put it on your face and it's great for day time moisturizer but I don't find that it's moisturizing enough for night time since my skin is very dry!,5

I have combination skin, and I'll occasionally get some acne and/or really dry skin. Because of this, it took me a long time to find a moisturizer that was super hydrating but not oily or greasy. I tried a few other brands, and they were alright, but this is my ALL TIME FAVORITE! The results are almost immediate; I'll wake up the next morning with super soft skin. I 100% recommend this, and I am NEVER buying anything other than this.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"This product offers a nice almost silky feeling base after applying, however... that's due to the moisture sucking ingredient Glycerin that's very high on the ingredients list. Glycerin creates a soft almost satin feeling texture that can feel moisturizing, however it's actually drawing moisture away from your skin. It also contains dyes and fragrance even though online it claims it doesn't. Maybe the formula changed? I do love the fact this moisturizer is cheap and effective and has Hyaluronic acid, it does work for a lot of people who DON'T have sensitive skin and don't care about ingredients, only outcome.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This moisturizer feels amazing when you apply it! I love the water consistency of it and it doesn't leave my face feeling oily.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I heard great things about this gel moisturizer and finally decided to try it. I got the mini just in case I didn't like it. But I love it! Feels great on my skin and really hydrates. 10/10 would recommend,4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"So I've used this for a couple weeks now and I'm not sure this is compatible with my skin. I have oily skin, it's a little sensitive but I don't really breakout much, I don't have acne issues. I mostly wanted something to help with aging as I'm in my late 30s and with my oiliness. But this is actually making my face itch and feel more sensitive. As if I exfoliated too much or something. It also burns as I apply it. I know with any irritation, it's time to stop using the product. I think it's a great gel for oily skin as it doesn't make my face more oily and my makeup sits well on top of it. But I'm too old for itchy face and the possibility of acne. So it's a no for me. If you have acne issues I'd say Neutrogena is a great and affordable for step. But if you don't have acne, this might be too strong and too irritating. I really have to send this back.....fast.",3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I have ridiculously sensitive fair skin with rosacea. I hate the feeling of lotion on my skin. I sweat a lot and specially right out of the shower. My skin just doesn't want to absorb lotion and it drives me crazy all sticky and wet for 40+ mins. So I've been trying all the gel and oil moisturizers. This one is the best! You apply is and instantly your skin drinks it. I can put makeup on minutes after i apply it. I use to have to skip moisturizer under makeup because it would just sit on top of my skin. This moisturizer has change my skin healthy and my makeup game! All my makeup looks and applies so smooth now!,5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This is a great basic moisturizer. I don't like the fragrance. If fragrance doesn't bother you then you should definitely try it!

I always go back to this one. It feels amazing on my acne prone oily skin and it hydrates my skin really well. I don't recommend this to dry skin people because it's very light. I also don't recommend piling on too much skincare products after applying this moisturizer because it will pill. Overall this product is amazing!,5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,the face mask is a different texture than a regular one. the face mask is like a jelly feeling. i have sensitive skin and this was perfect. after i let it sit for about 15 mins my skin felt so smooth and looked so pure and hydrated. i'm definitely buying this again.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Worth every penny!!! It actually does have your skin bouncing back like it says in the ads! Incredibly hydrated. At one point this was the only thing in my skincare routine! Will always rebuy and recommend! Great for all skin types (I'm oily and acne prone though I mostly just have hyperpigmentation) and it's REALLY great in winter when you need the extra hydration! The entire hydro boost line is great honestly.,4.4

But after a couple weeks I got red bumps all around my mouth and I was really confused what was up, but then I realized when I stopped using this stuff the bumps went away.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"This product has seriously saved my skin. I have oily skin, and before using this moisturizer daily, I had an extremely hard time stoping the shine on my face as well as preventing breakouts from all the oils. This is so hydrating that it has trained my skin to not produce so much oil, and I have really clear skin now. I also deal with eczema and haven't had any reoccur on my face since starting to use this. I'm in love with how it absorbs into your skin as if there's nothing there, but still keeps you moisturized. It just feels amazing to apply. The price and amount you get is a bit of a draw back, but when you compare that to how amazing it works, and the higher price of similar products, it's totally worth it. Can't recommend this enough.",3

Upon further investigation, it unfortunately appears that I have a sensitivity to hyaluronic acid, so I couldn't use this or any of the other products in the line, but it did generally work as a moisturizer for oily skin, so I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who doesn't have ridiculously sensitive skin like me. (BTW, for anyone who does, the replacement I found that worked great for me is the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel. Not the lotion+, not the oil control gel, though that might work great too, haven't tried, and definitely not the hydrating jelly, as that also has hyaluronic acid).",4.4

I usually prefer products that don't have fragrance added to them. But this one is worth the trade off!",3

I still wish they would either lighten the fragrance or make it fragrance free. If I use other products over it the fragrance comes back again strong.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I absolutely love this mask! My skin is extremely sensitive & I break out from just about any little thing. But this mask does the trick. Being on acne medications that are super drying it feels like a never ending cycle of dry skin and pimples but this mask does it for me! Completely hydrates and doesn't cause any irritation.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I ordered this moisturizer because the winter weather in my area is very unforgiving. On top of this, my apartment has poor air circulation and we use a gas heater, so our air gets very dry. I have a combination skin type. I get patches of dry and oily skin. My boyfriend on the other hand has very dry, sensitive skin. I was looking for a product that we could both use. This product is amazing for both of us. This is my first full day of using it, but I can already tell I love it. It isn't greasy and a little goes a VERY long way. I love this moisturizer because I can tell it's for all day wear. When I first put it on, I didn't feel much of a difference, but throughout the day my face has gotten very soft and supple. My dry patches are gone! My boyfriend said his face hasn't felt this good with a moisturizer in a long time. He has very sensitive skin and he can usually tell right away if something will be irritating because it'll burn. He hasn't burned all day and also feels that it improves throughout the day. When it arrived in the mail, it seemed a little small. I was a little discouraged. But I only needed the tiniest dab to cover my entire face and neck. Same with my boyfriend. Since it's a little pricey we plan to take turns purchasing this product. I love that it fits both of our very different skin types so well!",2
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,My brother and I both used this product. He's been using it for years and have very dry skin. He recommended it to me since he likes it so much. He also has sensitive skin but he's never had issues with it. I started using this in the summer because my regular moisturizer was too heavy as I have combination skin that gets oily in the summer.But I quickly realized something was wrong with my skin. Whenever I put the product on the smell was overwhelming and my skin felt irritated and slightly burned. It took me a while to realize this product was causing irritation and my skin wouldn't stop breaking out. Finally stopped using the product and switched back to my old moisturizer and my skin has calmed down significantly.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,There is plenty of serum in the packet but seems most of it stays there instead of sticking to the sheet mask. The mask itself slid around and did not adhere well to my face. I kept it on for the minimum 15 minutes and then applied the remaining serum from the packet 3 times (lots of juice) before finishing my routine. The serum is very light and hydrating with a light scent. It was great for my oily skin but I won't be repurchasing because the mask is too much of a hassle.,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Love this mask. It quenches my dry skin and makes it smooth afterwards. A must try mask for everyone to try.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I used to think I had super dry skin, the only reason was because I was using products that stripped my skin of good oils too much. This moisturizer is the only one I've found that doesn't break me out, doesn't leave me with dry patches, and doesn't have an overbearing scent. I tried the knock off version from ELF and got a breakout. Neutrogena did it again sweetie!",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This mask fully hydrates and smooths you're skin. Glad to find a mask that does it's job and is so inexpensive. You've got to give this a try.,5

Just makes it run a little until the smell fades. As for my skin though, it's hydrating and has helped my oily skin!",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I purchased this product because I was in need of a moisturizer and wanted one that was affordable.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I bought this and the serum at the same time, and I noticed how quick it absorbs into the skin. At first I thought it was great because I hate that sticky feeling while you wait for things to sink in. However, I noticed how matte my face would look afterwards and it still feels a bit tight and dry. After about a week, I've noticed these tiny whiteheads that are popping up near my nose and mouth, and I don't breakout there or have these particular breakouts. At first i thought it was the fragrance, because the product is HEAVILY fragranced. As I got to looking at the ingredients, and one of the biggest/highest ingredients is dimethicone! I really wished this worked for me, but with the fragrance, dimethicone, breakouts, and not moisturizing, I just cant recommend this.",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This mask is wonderful. Does everything it claims to do. But the WORK i have to put in tp get this mask on is kind of annoying only because its a 2 piecer and if your not Careful the serum that saturates the mask will drip out immediately. ( i like to save the extra to rub in after) this is not a multitasking mask and what i mean is you cant be walking around doing whatever else with this on because it will slip and move. So i suggest if you have the extra 10-15 minutes to just lay down and relax while waiting for this to work its magic then go for it ! But if your looking for something you can quickly slap on and move on then this isnt the one .,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I am someone who takes pride in my skincare. I read ingredients and educate myself on best practices. I invest in my skincare, but the most expensive isn't aways the best and, likewise, the most affordable isn't bad in and of itself. The latter couldn't be more true with these Hydro Boost Hydrating Hydrogel Masks. They are easily comparable to more expensive masks on the market. They out-perform some of their higher priced competitors with accessibility, comfort, size, and ingredients. I've been using these after going in hard with a new retinoid and they are soothing and hydrating. Make sure to follow with a moisturizer!",1

BUT THIS RIGHT HERE. Neutrogena hydro boost gel and every hydro boost product ! this will help your skin feel refresh again. honestly every hydro product iv bought has yet to disappoint me.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Before I open it or read the instructions in the back and it says to use the white part as a guide but everything is stuck together so it's really difficult to know how it goes on your face. I assumed the weird extra patch goes on the outside Incase you want to close your eyes. It's good for it's price it does hydrate!,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I have sensitive skin but I loved this mask. My face isn't irritated and feels super hydrated right now.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Love how it goes on. Does not last even when used with other Neutrogena products. Tried using along with Wrinkle Expert day/night moisturizer and is a little better.,4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,It moisturizes without feeling heavy.,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Not sure why this is marketed for dry skin because it's not hydrating. It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling tight no matter how much I apply. I also think it's breaking me out probably because my skin is trying to compensate for the lack of moisture. The only positive is that this didn't cause any irritation for my mildly sensitive skin. I feel like this product would only be good for oily skin if anything. Will be returning.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I have dry/combo skin and this really didn't do anything. Didn't really hydrate or make my skin feel nice. Only reason i am giving it two stars is because it smells nice.,3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I have used this mask once. Still too early to truly evaluate effectiveness. The first application was nice however skin did not feel as moisturized or awakened as it has with other products. Will definitely try a few more times.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have extremely oily skin and could never find a moisturizer that didn't make my skin tacky and slick. I tried this and it's my favorite. It moisturizes just enough but not so much that my makeup skids off within the hour. I could see how this wouldn't be enough for someone with dry or combination skin, but for someone whose skin never seems to dry out, it's a lifesaver.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I bought this out of recommendation from a dermatologist.... yikes. The instant I put it on my face, my skin dried out. I didn't think anything of it. I thought it absorbed nicely. Until I started to feel my skin and it was covered in bumps. I thought it was my face wash, so stupidly, I tried to add a little more... cue the actual visible sight of redness and bumps breaking out across my skin. I had to cleanse and remove the lotion, and find another moisturizer for it to finally calm down. While this doesn't have many ingredients, I've never had an allergic reaction to a skincare item, and this did NOT sit well with me. Be very aware of the ingredients that are in here, and approach with caution. Definitely patch test before you indulge, unlike me, who went all in, and my skin is still bumpy. :(",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I love this mask as a pick me up to refresh and hydrate my skin. This mask has a very interesting jelly texture and feels great when applied, I'm not that amused at the fact that it has two separate pieces, as you have to figure out placing for these masks to stay on without falling off. I'm not a big fan of heavily scented face products this particular one isn't as strong as any of the other hydro boost products. I love putting it in the refrigerator for 10 mins prior to use. I like to use this mask in the morning but does work very well at night layered with thicker night creams. These masks have a lot of extra serum if want to get more bang for your buck you can pour the leftover product into an empty serum bottle and use a couple more times. I highly recommend the purifying and brightening masks in this same line.",5

Unlike the cream, the water gel has fragrance in it which in my opinion completely ruins this product. I have sensitive skin. Sometimes, this product will cause my skin to burn but that's mostly only when it's been going through the gigs (wind burn, sun damage, dentist appointment lol). Anyways, I can never use this moisturizer alone as it doesn't give me enough moisture. That really sucks because this moisturizer isn't cheap. Either way, I will give the hydro Boost cream a shot once I run out of this tub. This product does have some positives and could be really nice if you have oily skin. I am very acne prone and this didn't break me out. It is super lightweight and not greasy. Additionally, it does a really great job at smoothing texture thanks to dimethicone which isn't the awful ingredient that some people make it out to be. It's actually beneficial but can create the illusion of more moisturized skin.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I've tried numerous facial creams and always experienced problems no matter what brand I used. This water gel is different. I LOVE that this is a gel and not a cream. It soaks in quickly and doesn't feel like you rubbed lotion on your face. My combination skin feels even and looks and feels very hydrated. No burning, no tingling, no redness, no discomfort in any way. This is, by far, the best facial moisturizer I've used to this day. Highly recommend.",3

I LOVE that this is a gel and not a cream. It soaks in quickly and doesn't feel like you rubbed lotion on your face. My combination skin feels even and looks and feels very hydrated. No burning, no tingling, no redness, no discomfort in any way. This is, by far, the best facial moisturizer I've used to this day. Highly recommend.",5

My skin is normal, no acne, not oily or dry, but when I tried this product out I noticed it would cause redness in my skin and tiny little red bumps.

I have struggled for YEARS to find a moisturizer that actually works and won't break out my skin, or make it more oily. Using this, has helped my skin so much, because it hydrates my skin and doesn't break me out, and it isn't oily. Many complain about the scent of it, but it isn't bad. It almost smells kind of tropical or like some type of detergent- I don't really know how to describe it. The texture feels kind of like a primer, so it's not super creamy like other moisturizers, but it is not heavy at all!",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I use the SPF version as a daytime application and the extra dry version for evening application.

My skin is combination, oily on the t-zone and the rest is very dry. I put it on the dry spots clearly because it's to hydrate and it soon enough began to burn my face, I'm guessing because of the strong mfn fragrance it has. After I took it off my face it turned red. Don't buy this, save your money.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This mask broke me out with itchy skin almost immediately! I thought the tingle was the mask working but it was my skin becoming irritated. So disappointed because my skin was in great condition before this. Do not recommend this mask.,2

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I want to start by saying, Neutrogena, please never change anything about this product. For me, as an extremely oily, dehydrated, sensitive, acne prone gal I struggle to find products that work for my skin. I'm Korean so I naturally always gravitate towards k and j beauty products. They work better for my skin. Over the last few years I've struggled with cystic acne so I have to be really careful with what I put on my skin. I try to look for non-comedogenic products to avoid further breakouts. I read a really great review on this product from an article I found on pinterest after searching best products for my skin type. The reviewer's review really checked all the boxes off my list for what I was looking for so I reached for this right away. I was so pleased after trying this. Experienced no breakouts, pore blurring results and sat super well under make-up. I never had any issues with dryness and felt this product plumped up areas like smile lines. I'm always on the hunt for something better with everything I use, so I'll try something different for a bit but I keep finding myself coming back to this product. I've tried really expensive to not so expensive moisturizers trying to find that HG, but I honestly think this product may be that for me. I've been using it for 3 years now and once I leave, I always come back to it. This is the one moisturizer I've repurchased the most because I love it that much. It really stinks to read it hasn't worked for other folx, but as someone who struggles with most products, I really hope Neutrogena doesn't change anything about this one and I hope those can find something that works for them too. If you're on the fence of trying it, I'd say give it a whirl.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have super dry skin,dry patches from on my cheeks.I've tried many high brand moisterizers and they never did the job. until I finally decided to try this. its amazing!

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,A little goes a long way with this moisturizer. It doesn't leave any residue or greasy feeling on my face. It absorbs well into my skin so I don't have any small flakes left on my skin like with some other moisturizers I have tried.,2
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I'm so sad to see people not like this product! I have very sensitive skin that downright just sucks! It is oily/acne prone, but super sensitive so I never know what I can and can't use. I have been using this in the am and pm now for months! Even under my makeup it is perfect. It is not greasy and my skin feels so soft. I put this on in the morning before my primer and it is perfect! In the evening I do my night routine and put this on to sleep and perfect! The one thing that I will say is that I'm very disappointed in the way that the other products in this line work. I purchased the water gel with the sunscreen added and it was HORRIBLE! I also purchased the city shield and had terrible results. I suppose it depends on each person and their skin. I did love this product enough to try and get the whole line, but this is the only thing I've found that I can stick to and actually works amazing. I can't go without it!",4.4

After every shower and face wash, I use this and my face feels sooooo smooth. A little goes a long way.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This broke me out so bad and I've never experienced a product breaking me out. After a week and half of use I noticed all these little tiny bumps on my cheeks that looked like white heads or something and I put a face mask on and it made them stand out SO MUCH they looked huge and my pores were HUGE I was so scared because tbh I have clear skin and get minimal pimples so this was new and I knew it was this moisturizer because it was the only thing I changed from my skin routine and I wasn't on my period. This wasn't for me I guess even though to heard it was great I'll pass.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Its very cool to the touch and lightweight on your face! Definitely love it. I will definitely buy it again. And ive got tons of products in my bathroom but this one is one of my favs. Doesnt break my fave out or make it feel oily.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"Amazing.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I feel like this is trying to be a dupe for a popular water sleeping mask of a similar color and scent, but it misses the mark. Instead of smelling light and fresh, it smells strongly like a bathroom air freshener. If you have sensitive skin or are bothered by fragrance, stay away from this product! I could maybe forgive the overuse of fragrance if it worked well, but it's honestly too lightweight for my skin type and feels slightly drying. This may be better for oily skin types, but my dry/dehydrated people should probably look elsewhere. Not worth it, especially for the price.",3

My cheeks are burned to the touch and the rash all over my forehead is disgusting. After doing a lot of review reading I learned I wasn't the only one with this reaction.

This is the absolute worst I've ever tried. I ended up with red bumps and rough, dry patches after the first use. It absorbed quickly, to a satin finish that left my skin still feeling dry. I re-applied after an hour - still too dry. The next day I tried again and even my husband commented my skin was red and asked if I was feeling well. I tested some on his face and the same thing happened - dry, rough patches except his were also itchy. Rinsed it off and our skin felt better plain, without it. Everyone raving about this product was from years ago with many new reviews reporting the same reaction. I'm thinking the formula has changed? I can't recommend against this enough.",1

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I am a huge K beauty brand lover, and started with those, so maybe I'm more used to the way your skin feels after a mask like Tony Moly type mask. But my sister absolutely raves about these, so I decided to give them a shot! It's..... ok. Not my favorite. It didn't do anything bad to my skin, but nothing stellar either. I loved the way they felt, super relaxing gel that makes you feel like your in a spa with cucumbers on your eyes. I have dry skin, but not overly dry. But after the 15 minutes, I took it off and my skin IMMEDIATELY dried, I could almost feel the moisture flying off my face! I still had to moisturize after, which I usually do, but usually I have a lot more serum left on and feel super plump. I feel like this would be a good mask for normal/oily skin as a serum mask, to treat/add something to your routine, and moisturize after. But for dry skin, it's reallyyyyyyy not my favorite at all.",3

My nose has large pores and I get blackheads on a daily basis but the SIZE & darkness of these blckheads is crazy! It looks like somebody dotted me with an ink pen. I even get huge blackheads on my cheeks from this which I don't typically have blackheads on my cheeks. Unfortunately I just can't use it anymore.

I have to apply several layers because it just soaks into my skin immediately . I feel like there's not much product I'm there for that, so it runs out quickly. I'll use this until I can find something better. It's okay, but I wouldn't recommend for extremely dry skin. It works great as a lighter moisturizer. Bonus is it never made me breakout",5

This is now going to be my moisturizer from this point forward. I instantly knew it putting it on. Its so soft, gentle and great feeling on the face. Not to mention it smells sooo good. I highly recommend this to others. Will definitely be purchasing again when needed.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have dry/combo skin. I am currently using a topical prescription acne product that left me with dry patched on my chin and cheeks. I bought this moisturizer because I wanted something that wouldn't clog my pores. This product didn't work at all for me. I would apply it after washing my face in the morning, then go about doing my hair, and by the time I was ready to do my makeup my skin was already flaky and dry again.",4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I tried this product because people were raving about it. I was using a moisturizer that was greasy and left my skin feeling heavy. This product does not give me that feeling and using it prior to makeup has been wonderful. I must say though it doesn't seem to be the most moisturizing product I have ever used. Thankfully my skin isn't extremely dry so,so far so good!",4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"This moisturizer is great. I've spent years trying out all different kinds of moisturizers and until now I haven't found one that would moisturize my face without giving me breakouts. I've been increasingly prone to breakouts as I age, but I also want to make sure I use something to keep my skin from over-drying and getting wrinkles! With this, my skin feels and looks soft and well-hydrated without being greasy or feeling like I've got an extra layer on top of it.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I love this. It moisturizes so great. My skin is dry to combination.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This is the only moisturizer that has made my skin so soft and not make me greasy. The smell is so light and nice. By far my favorite part of my skin care routine now!!,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin and my skin feels very moisturized without clogging my pores. It's a great product, I use it in the mornings and after I get out of the shower. It's a great dupe for the Clinique",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I love the consistency and hydration of the moisturizer. It is a very effective moisturizer, however the gel medium makes me wish the product had longer hydrating effects. So my skin still felt fresh hours later",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I love this sheet mask! I apply after washing and toning, then follow it with a moisturizer and it makes my skin so soft and hydrated. The essence from the mask is also easy to massage into your skin and doesn't get everywhere",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I currently have it on while writing the review. Im noticing a cooling feeling which burns stings a little... i usually dont buy otc products. But i needed something deaperately My first inital thought! Packaging could be better.. for the ladies having problem putting this on, you want lip and eye flaps facing outwards, the textured part of the mask on your skin. U just slide your finger across to make it stick!! The mask get tacky as the produxt absorbs into your skin",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"Maybe it's my picky/sensitive skin type, but it broke me out with acne. It feels amazing, very refreshing and moisturizing; unfortunately it made my face red and clogged my pores after a week. Good luck to anyone who tries this. Btw- my skin is weird. Dry after I wash it (every soap I've tried, highend-drugstore), and mildly oily after a long day.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"Okay I never ever leave reviews because I'm very lazy lol but I had to leave one for this, I've been using this after I use the cleanser everyday and I must say my skin is like extra plump and squishy (in a good way) it's made my face super smooth. I have very sensitive skin like to the point where I get shots every Tuesday for it, and this didn't break me out and it's just amazing I wish it was a tiny bit cheaper tbh though",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,It was just okay. It didn't really do anything good for my skin but also didn't do anything bad. I would of liked it if the packaging was better. Once you open it everything slides off including the white film. Because of that I didn't know what was the part that goes on your face . Then it's split in two. So the top part was stuck to the bottom. I understand the concept of why they split the mask. But maybe out a divider in the packaging. Like the tonymoly strawberry nose strips. Or even just made it a full mask. It was it's to much of a hassle to put on. Then it had the mouth and eye flaps. Those where awkward as well and made it even more difficult to put on. I don't think I'll buy this again. I'll try the over night gel mask instead. It was just to much of a hassle to put on,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This works great in my sensitive skin. I use it every night and my skin feels smooth in the mornings. Highly recommend!,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"A friend recommended me this moisturizer 2 years ago, time passed by and never bought it, she gave it to me for Christmas and I absolutely love it! It leaves the skin soft (like baby skin) and gives you the energy boost for a good looking face! I think it's a very good mostiourizer and affordable. But everyone has different types of skin so I recommend to ask a specialist before buying it, mine is normal kind of oily sometimes and fitted pretty well!",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have SUPER sensitive skin and was hesitant about trying this product but kept hearing great things about it! It makes my skin feel super hydrated and refreshed. It does have a light fragrance but doesn't bother my skin, surprisingly! I'd recommend this product! Definitely better than Clinique moisture surge for me.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"This moisturizes my dry spots right away and absorbs quickly into the skin. It has never made me break out, and I have naturally oily skin",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I was so excited when I saw this product as I have always used neutrogena and liked them. I've trusted them to be good, safe products since they market themselves as such. I didn't know as much about ingredients at the time and didn't think to look (my fault) as I have always trusted neutrogena. But I'm using this on my arms to get worth out of it because I can't stand the smell and I don't want to use fragrance and dyes on my face, especially in my skincare. They are only there for aesthetic and I think the jar is good enough (I love the jar design). Why do we need to dye something to convince people it feels like water? I feel like I wasted my money on this product and I can't wait to finish it. Also I put it on 20 minutes ago and I can still smell it. Ugh...",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I absolutely love this product and will NEVER use anything else!!! I have very oily skin and during the winter it tends to dry out ALOT, which it just started doing this within the past two years. I ran out last summer and tried a countless number of different moisturizers. Nothing compared to this one. I learned my lesson and will never use another product!",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"The best spf face lotion I've ever used. Never oily, have never gotten a sunburn while using it, and have also never broken out",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"i finally got this after running out of my old moisturizer (clinique moisture surge) and i have to say i like it a lot more. i have combination skin that tends towards oily and i find that products with hyaluronic acid really help. this product keeps my skin moisturized without making it greasy. it also does a nice job of sinking into the skin and not leaving it sticky like the clinique did. this does have frangrance in it, which i'm not crazy about, but i haven't noticed any ill effects yet, and i actually quite like the scent. it's very fresh and clean.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I LOVE this stuff! I use it twice a day, every day.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have been using this water gel for over a year now and have noticed results from the very first day I used it.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I tried it but I had know idea which side was the correct way! Didn't see much happening. It reminded me a lot of the gel face moisturizer they sell. I will try it again since I bought a couple and I'll update this review!,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"Best face mask. If your skin can get super dry like mine, this is for you. I am always hesitant to try drug store brands but this is amazing. I usually would drop alot of money at ""the other store"" for a product like this. It helped my skin while I was home visiting in Ohio in the winter. This mask makes me face feel so soft right after I use it. For the price you cant go wrong.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Like it!,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This project dried my face around my t zone and month area,4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I have combination skin. This will not moisturize a lot. I think this would be perfect for people with only oily skin. If you have dry skin you will still feel dry after applying it. Feels good when you first apply it though.,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"i received this product in a sample bag and tried it out when the weather turned colder. So far, it has been excellent for my sensitive combination skin and I just purchased the full size product because I enjoyed it so much. A little goes a long way and my skin feels hydrated without the greasiness or breakouts. Even my brow expert at Ulta's Benefit Brow Bar noticed the difference in my skin during my last brow wax! The only thing (and it's a nitpicky thing at that) is that I wish I was packaged in a bottle versus a pot because I feel it would help me control how much I use and prevent wasting product. Otherwise I love it and will plan to repurchase!",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I really love this mask!,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Really like this product! My teenagers even get into it! U used Chanel hydra for several winters but gave this product a shot two years ago. Hooked!,2
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have tried multiple sheet masks but this has to top all the ones I have tried before, my skin is dry and this mask leaves my skin glowing after use!",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This feels great going on and my breakout prone kids with oily dehydrated skin love it. Hyaluronic based moisturizers are hit or miss for me. Some cause break outs and some dont. Unfortunately this one caused a new breakout every time I wore it. I've found a similar type of moisturizer from FAB that works well but is unfortunately more expensive.,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,After days of using my skin broke out. Will not recommend to any one.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I loved this mask. It smelled clean and felt good on the skin. Only thing is the te and mouth holes are not cut out all the way. They have like a flap. Which is okay because if you want to take a small nap while it's working you can hydrate your lips and mouth, but what if I wanna eat popcorn and watch TV? They're just hanging there.",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,So I love this moisturizer because it's a dupe for Beliefs Aqua bomb. It has the same feelings and cooling sensation. It makes you look hydrated and doesn't leave a sticky feeling when it absorbs. Doesn't break me out. I have dry normal skin and my nose tends to peel after a hot shower. So I apply this and it feels awesome.,2
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I use it right after I wash my face. At night I put it on and let it absorb but if needed will apply a heavier night cream.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,It feels light on your face. Does not feel or look greasy.,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I bought this same product but from target. This is amazing in the summer if you have oily skin. It's not greasy at all. By far, this is my favorite moisturizer",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,works well and smells amazing!,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I have an oily Tzone and this works for me. It dries quickly for the girl getting ready in a hurry in the morning. I love it.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I really wanted to like this mask. I have heard good things about this mask so I bought one to try. However, I simply couldn't get past it not staying securely on my face for even 2 seconds so I threw it away.",4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This caused really bad breakouts for me from small bumps to cystic acne. Will be returning.,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I just love this product.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Nice product. I goes on nicely and smells amazing. I'll be buying it again.,3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,You need this,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I love this type of mask. I have acne prone skin that gets very dry during the winter. This definitely helps without causing extra breakouts. It can be messy when you open the package from the liquid on the mask.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I would just use one pump of this on my face every day and I just kept noticing my face getting more oily. I saw no beneficial effects after using it for almost 5 weeks.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This stuff is... AMAZING!! I recently had a bad skin reaction to a mask I did so my face was SO dry. I'm talking like patches of dry flaky skin. I applied this 3 times a day for two days and the dryness was gone. A little goes a long way with this product which I enjoy. Highly recommend and will be buying again!,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I have added this to my everyday routine. I love it I think it's a dupe for the H20+ Oasis Hydrating moisturizer. I love the Hydro Boost Line sm.,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"My husband's dermatologist recommended this product. He tried it and loves it. Now it's all he will use. I always keep an extra on hand since he goes through it so quickly. Thats the thing, the gel is so light that it absorbs very quickly and you use more of it. Overall, I would recommend this product.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I generally have oily skin but its more combination in the winter months. The daily moisturizer that I use works so well at minimizes oil that it leaves dry patches around my chin and forehead during the winter months so I supplement it with this moisturizer at night and it works great for me. It does take more than a few minutes to absorbs but it does make your skin feel super moisturized. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone with oily skin for summertime though.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have now used this twice & I LOVE it. I'm a big fan of the Hydro Boost line. I have the moisturizer, the eye moisturizer & the fragrance free lotion. I love em all.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"The only thing I don't like is the container. I hate cosmetics that come in these pots. It is difficult to get all of the product out. If you have nails and are sticking you fingers in to get the moisturizer out, some of it always ends up under your fingernails. Pot is also heavy for travel. Container looks great, but not convenient at all to use.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I don't write reviews, but MY GOD this stuff is amazing! It's literally like heaven in a jar for my skin. I have combo skin, oily in my t-zone and normal on the perimeter. This instantly hydrates my skin without the greasy feeling. The best way to describe it is almost like putting water on your face and letting it soak in. Can't find any other moisturizer to replace it! My absolute FAVE!",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Love this moisturizer! Curology recommended it so I decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. So light weight and it feels like heaven when you put it on. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate it at all. My face feels hydrated all day after using this. Definitely recommend!,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Great product for daily use in the winter months for moisture.,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I bought this because I heard such amazing things about it. I had to stop using this because of a burning sensation and irritation of my skin. I can not recommend this product! Buyer beware.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"Those with sensitive skin should stay away from this product. I have sensitive skin and it is always difficult to find something that won't irritate my face. I really wanted to like this, but my skin broke out very quickly after use.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I absolutely love this moisturizer,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I actually don't mind the smell and I am a big smell person. I thought it worked great for my dry skin, especially for this time of year. I do think it's a bit slippery, although it does stay on your face once you get it on. And I wish it came in 1 piece instead of 2. I also think the flaps for the eyes and mouth holes are kind of a waste. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this product! I have a slightly oily t-zone and really dry skin in the winter around my mouth and chin. It helped clear it up! Would buy again.",4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I wanted to like this product, it moisturized nicely and absorbed nicely into my skin...it seemed to last a long time...however it had a really strong detergent-like smell to it and it caused a reaction in my skin...little red bumps everywhere...not acne but hard bumps...they haven't gone away yet!! Do not recommend if you have sensitive skin unfortunately.",4.4

My skin is dry enough that I sometimes need a second or third application, but it never ever makes me break out or feel greasy. Skin as soft as anything and calms my overheating and redness. Even though its a little out of my price range, I'm investing in this again. Really really worth it. Only complaint is the ""smaller on the inside"" concept. I ran out of this stuff pretty quickly.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I've been using this product for over a year now and have loved it, although I've noticed that it has started to burn whenever I put it on after washing my face and using it after my toner and serum (which is what I've always done.) this could very well be due to my personal skin type changing, but it is heartbreaking due to the fact that it is one of my favorite moisturizers. The burning stops after it absorbs in, but has anyone else had an experience like this? Did Neutrogena possibly change the formula?",3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I tried this mask because I have dry skin and I use the hydro boost cleanser, and I HATED IT!!!! 1. Made me breakout, 2. Bad smell, and 3. WAY TO SLIPPERY!!! DEFINITELY would NOT recommend",1
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"My skin seems to like this one better than the jar versions.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I have combination skin and I do a modify 10 step k-beauty. I love these masks and use them for my night time routine.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I love how this stuff makes my skin feel. It helps moisturize but I need something with a little more oomph. It works really well for a night or morning routine.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I use this as my daily moisturizer under my makeup. It works well but I will probably go back to the Olay daily moisturizer as it's more cost efficient and they seem to do the same thing. This smells like sunscreen.,3

When my skin clears up I might go back to this but overall it just wasnt a good product for acne,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I was put on this product as part of a skin care regime for some issues I was having. It is AMAZING!

I will never go back to a moisturizer!,4.4

It leaves my skin looking absolutely beautiful every time I use it. I've used this moisturizer regularly for the past year and a half and I've definitely noticed a difference in my skin. My skin is brighter, glowy, smoother, and I've even noticed my acne isn't as bad since throwing this in my daily regimen. This product is honestly my holy grail!!!!",3

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I purchased this moisturizer recently after the Aveeno one I was using was discontinued. I had used the fragrance and dye free version of this when this line first came out. I liked it but needed something a little more hydrating in winter. This batch (with the fragrance and dye) has such a strong, masculine scent that I don't think I will purchase it again. I don't know why skincare (facial especially) is fragranced at all. The smell is just so strong and not a good choice for sensitive skin. I also don't understand why there is so much packaging for this. The container is huge for a small amount of cream, and then it comes in a huge box! Unless they bring back the fragrance free version again I will be skipping this the next time I need to buy a moisturizer.",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I love the hydro gel line SO much, the moisturizer and face wash is amazing, not only can you instantly feel a difference in the softness of your skin, but they all smell so good! But, this product was definitely the flop of the line in my opinion. If you are acne prone, I wouldn't recommend this product at all. My entire face broke out through our the first day of wearing this ( the other products that I've tried from this line haven't had the same results at all ) I wanted to love it, and I hate that I don't, but I definitely would pass if you're looking for a good sun screen that doesn't clog your pores.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I started using this moisturizer a month ago and I absolutely love it. This moisturizer absorbs into the skin quickly, doesn't make my skin oily, and also hydrates the areas of my skin that are dry. Before using this moisturizer I felt that my makeup always looked flaky and oily at the same time and I thought it was the makeup I was using. After using this moisturizer, my makeup looks smooth and I haven't experienced any of the strange flaky/oily phenomena. The only reason I took away a star on this review is because the product doesn't last very long. I've only had mine for a little over a month and it's almost empty.",5

I've tried so many different face washes and lotions, this is by far my favorite!",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Use this product at night! Need more moisture for day wear. Absorbs to a soft finish. Use quite a bit of the product to feel moistured and wait a few minutes to soak in.,3

It's never broken me out like most do, but when you really want some extra hydration I would consider an eye cream or night cream because this will provide only a daily light hydration.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I have very oily skin and have been looking for a moisturizer that would keep my skin hydrated without enhancing the oils in my skin. The moisturizer I was using before this one did just that and was on the pricier side. I bought this after hearing such great reviews thinking it would be perfect for my skin while being more affordable. Unfortunately after a couple of weeks I noticed my skin was beginning to feel very tight and dry patches started to appear on my cheeks. I have since stopped using this product and gone back to my old moisturizer and doing this alone has brought my skin back to life. I think I would prefer being a tad bit oily than have random dry patches on my skin. It is disappointing since I had really high hopes for this product.,5

It's a fine moisturizer - light, non-greasy, although it didn't seem to last very long and it took a while to absorb - but if you have sensitive skin, I recommend steering clear, especially if you're sensitive to fragrance. It has a very strong scent and left a slight burning sensation when first applied. A shame, because I really wanted to like this one!

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"excuse my spelling and grammar please, i'm dyslexic. i bought like 6 of these at a local drugstore (ulta doesn't ship to alaska and the closest one is literally 1-5,000 miles away) i have normal/dry dehydrated skin, leaning on the sensitive side. but not too sensitive, i can put some products with fragrance on my face if it's not too much. this tho. this was too much fragrance for me, it's SO STRONG. it smells like a perfume your grandma would wear. sadly most of the masks at the drugstore are like this. the fragrance was so strong, in fact, that it made my skin itch and i had a little breakout. but i used them all tho, nonetheless. i did however like how hydrated it made my skin feel. i highly recommend the hydro boost face wash over these, there is fragrance in it but it's not overpowering like this is. it's actually rather nice. hopefully the whole line doesn't smell like this.",2
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"please remove the STRONG grandma-y fragrance from this, it's disgusting. other than that i like this. it stayed on really well.",4.4

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,These are incredible if you are looking for a quick pick me up for your skin. Hyaluronic acid is a very gentle acid that attracts water molecules. It's the perfect ingredient for moisture. I have very sensitive skin and I'm be had no problems with these masks. They're easy to apply since it's in 2 pieces and they hold a lot of product. I have repurchased numerous times and will continue to do so,3
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I honestly buy this because it is a moisturizer that agrees with my skin AND is affordable And comes in a tube. Hard combo to find, strangely. So many of the moisturizers I like come in a tub you have to stick your finger in, yuck. I try to use a spatula, but always end up dipping my finger in when in a hurry or something. So, this stuff it is!",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,Love this!,2
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"The mask is in two halves which i appreciate, it stays on fine but i was laying down. The packaging is pretty, it's kinda rainbowy. It hydrated my face to some effect, but my insanely dry nose is still somewhat dry. Everywhere else on my face does feel quenched though. My cheeks feel deeply hydrated, but they're the only place. My cheeks also feel very supple. It's less papery than an ordinary sheet mask. It contoured to my skin well. It felt gentle on my skin, but towards the end of the 15 minutes it felt a bit itchy.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I've been using this for almost a week after I quit another moisturizer that made me break out, and so far it's been my holy grail. Feels amazing when applied and it stays throughout the day. My face is naturally oily and I feel like I always have to dab throughout the day, but with this I don't. If it keeps up, I will forever use this! Also way less expensive than other moisturizers that have failed me. Definitely give it a try if you've been searching for that perfect skin care tool!",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I use this every night before bed. It goes on smooth and easy. It hydrates well and it has such a light clean smell.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"Was so excited to use this because I've been using Neutrogena for years and years. But after a few days, my skin started to get red and break out around my chin. At first, I didn't know why but, as a precautionary measure, I stopped all my skincare for a couple days. My zits went away and no new ones formed. I used my other products without this gel, and no breakouts happened. Let's say, i wasn't happy.",5

I walk to and from the train station to get to work each day and this gel has been great against the elements and does not cause me to break out.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"First impressions: Nice texture and applies easily, but what a HORRIBLE smell. Overwhelming laundry detergent scent that lingers long after the application. Also, why do companies add fragrances and dyes to their products? They serve no beneficial purpose. I had high hopes for this product as I was looking for an oil-free moisturizer for my acne-prone skin. Sadly this is not it. If you look carefully at the ingredients list, the product is full of silicones which will ""sit"" on top of your skin. That's what gives your skin the illusion of suppleness and hydration, not the hyaluronic acid, which is very low on the list. Also, highly irritating ingredients in this. I had rubbed one of my eyes which proceeded to cause horrible irritation and sensitivity even with washing hands after applying the gel. If your skin tolerates anything, I can see this being used as a somewhat decent primer. Otherwise, look elsewhere for a skin-friendly moisturizer that actually does the job.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I'm obsessed with the whole hydro boost line. This is a great multipurpose sunscreen and moisturizer.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I've used this stuff ever since it came out. One reason why I love it is the scent. It reminds me of a beach or a spa.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I bought this because I was out of my Urban Decay moisturizer and wanted to save a couple bucks. I opened this up and my gosh the thing is so full of fragrance it nearly knocked me over. I had read the ingredient list and decided, ""It can't be that bad, can it?"" I was wrong. It just has the worst old lady perfume smell! I did try it once, just to test it out, and the smell does sort of go away after a while, but it's just not worth it. It also didn't really moisturize my face. It's like it disappeared on my face, leaving that horrible smell behind. If you're sensitive to scent, buy something else.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I love this sheet mask! It doesn't break me out or upsets my super sensitive skin and it really hydrates it! I only use this once in a while when I feel like my skin needs a little extra help and the price is reasonable. Only thing I don't like about it is it comes in two parts- one sheet from the nose up and one sheet from nose down. I think it should just be one cohesive sheet and it's kinda annoying. Overall love it though and such a great product!,4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I was an avid user of Clinique Moisture Surge for years. The price point was a bit high, but I found it to be more effective and less greasy than traditional face lotions.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have oily skin so I was on the market for a water based moisturizer that wouldn't leave any greasiness on my skin. This definitely hits the mark!! I love how it absorbs and leaves my skin feeling fresh. This allows me to use it every day, even under my makeup, which is exactly what I'm looking for. Only downside to it is i sometimes use another moisturizer on top of it or sometimes I use a heavier cream at night, just because I'm not sure how deep this is actually moisturizing.",5

It was not hydrating what so ever and I still experienced the same dry and flaky spots on my face, and I don't even have dry skin! It also absorbs terribly! It feels like a thin sticky film on my skin after and it's not pleasant at all. To make matters worse, upon using the product it made my skin irritated, red, blotchy and plain embarrassing! It left my face burning and my eyes hurting. If you have sensitive skin, I would NOT use this. It left me with ugly red cheeks for days. Lastly, the smell doesn't smell natural or pleasant. It smells chemically enhanced.",5

Smell wise- it's unique, not gross but I don't really care for it. My skin started to look dry again by late night. I feel like this needs to be applied multiple times a day to be effective.

This isn't terrible, considering gels aren't meant for dry skin. However, for the price, it would have been nice if worked in my drier areas.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I've waited to try this because I have so much skincare that it's overwhelming to introduce something new into my routine - I tend to waste a lot as it is. My skin type: skin tone, light to medium; fine lines, enlarged pores, combination/oily skin with dryness around my eyes (my entire orbital area) if I don't consume plenty of water and moisturize properly. I follow a strict beauty routine that includes different cleansers for morning and night. I double cleanse after I wear makeup and use specific serums and moisturizers in the morning and then use separate and different types of serums and moisturizers at night. My morning routine includes a stabalized Vitamin C Serum combined with a Serum to lock it in, followed with a light cream for my cheeks and nose; a cream for the rest of my face, an eye serum, then 2 heavier eye creams. My nighttime routine is similar only I use an AHA and BHA, then heavier serums and creams with pure sqaulane oil, then a heavier gel moisturizer to lock it all in. It works for me and keeps my skin balanced. I'm conscientious of all ingredients in Skincare and makeup. Although my skin has oily areas, I would rather be super moisturized than dry. I do what I can to prevent deep wrinkles. Because I have spent so much money on skincare products with rave reviews, I waited to buy this. I've been eyeballing it since it was introduced to the consumer. The list of ingredients would leave one to believe that this moisturizer would be great; however, it managed to break my face out, leave my face feeling like I had a something as heavy as Pond's cold cream on, yet made my face and neck peel ALL over. I had no smooth areas for over a week and that's been with me taking desperate measures. My skin has started to repair, but thanks to that whole buy one, get one 50% off (this should have been a red flag) I now have two jars of this cheap junk that I don't even want to give to anyone.

The moisturizer is a really nice, smooth, gel texture and it does have a strong scent, which I really liked but I can definitely see it being a problem for those sensitive to scent. I didn't notice the smell lasting throughout the day though, only when I first opened the jar. The gel felt nice and cool on my skin, but I don't feel like it really absorbed into my skin or provided much moisture, just kinda sat on top.

My morning routine includes a stabalized Vitamin C Serum combined with a Serum to lock it in, followed with a light cream for my cheeks and nose; a cream for the rest of my face, an eye serum, then 2 heavier eye creams. My nighttime routine is similar only I use an AHA and BHA, then heavier serums and creams with pure sqaulane oil, then a heavier gel moisturizer to lock it all in. It works for me and keeps my skin balanced. I'm conscientious of all ingredients in Skincare and makeup. Although my skin has oily areas, I would rather be super moisturized than dry. I do what I can to prevent deep wrinkles. Because I have spent so much money on skincare products with rave reviews, I waited to buy this. I've been eyeballing it since it was introduced to the consumer. The list of ingredients would leave one to believe that this moisturizer would be great; however, it managed to break my face out, leave my face feeling like I had a something as heavy as Pond's cold cream on, yet made my face and neck peel ALL over. I had no smooth areas for over a week and that's been with me taking desperate measures. My skin has started to repair, but thanks to that whole buy one, get one 50% off (this should have been a red flag) I now have two jars of this cheap junk that I don't even want to give to anyone. Heads up! There's is better products for less $$.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I love this product! Amazing at keeping your skin hydrated. It can feel a little heavy at times but as long as you use the right amount according to your skin it should be great! I have dry skin and use a good amount, and my fiancé uses it as well but he has more oily skin so he just uses a small amount daily. We both love it!",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I have combination skin (oily t-zone, normal to dry cheeks) and was looking for a more hydrating moisturizer with the change of the season. Despite all the hype I had heard for this product, it did not do anything. This provided no moisture but instead just sat on top of the skin leaving a weird, heavy feeling. After 2 uses it gave me cysts all across my forehead. I would not recommend this.",4.4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"This product got great reviews, and I was looking for a daily moisturizer for my oily, acne-prone skin that wouldn't make me feel greasy, so I decided to try it out. The moisturizer is a really nice, smooth, gel texture and it does have a strong scent, which I really liked but I can definitely see it being a problem for those sensitive to scent. I didn't notice the smell lasting throughout the day though, only when I first opened the jar. The gel felt nice and cool on my skin, but I don't feel like it really absorbed into my skin or provided much moisture, just kinda sat on top. It is definitely non-greasy, but after a couple weeks of use, I had one of the worst breakouts of my life, and ultimately returned the product.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"My face is an oil pot and I wanted to try a gel moisturizer to get me hydrated without adding more oil. This is perfect.

I was on the hunt for a moisturizer that wouldn't break me out, and all the hype surrounding this product being great for all skin types definitely got me. I HATE THIS. It burns going on, and the smell lingers even after I've applied and set my makeup. It also caused numerous dry patches of actually flaking skin. I normally don't have ""flaky"" skin, but I did while using this. It also gave me little white heads that burst when you touch them. Sadly I'm still on the hunt for a moisturizer.",5

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This product completely changed my skin. I never knew that my cream moisturizer was the culprit in my skin getting greasy throughout the day!

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I absolutely love this product. I have dehydrated yet oily skin. I absolutely love this under my makeup. It doesn't seem to moisturizer enough but leaves my skin silky smooth. Just wish there wasn't perfume in the product. Usually means it contains some sort of bad alcohol. But I still like it. Just never use it alone as a moisturizer.,5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"Wow. I never write reviews, but for my extremely dry/combination skin, this moisturizer is by far the best i have EVER tried. 100% would recommend this product to people with my skin type.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"I like this product because it is an oil free yet moisturizing layer, for under make up. It has sunscreen and especially in the summer, I don't want a heavy layer as I wear other products as well, including foundation most days. The fact that it's light but has hyaluronic acid is the clincher for me, as that is a recommended ingredient for pulling moisture to the skin. I would like to see a higher SPF but my foundations usually have sunscreen too, so it seems like enough.",5

I do see a lot of complaints about the smell but I actually love it, it's very refreshing almost like a glorified very fresh baby powder smell. This moisturizer also helps my very oily skin build-up, when I wake up in the morning usually my face is extremely oily, but with this there's almost no oil and makes me skin extremely soft.

It feels light, soaks in immediately, feels incredibly hydrating, dries matte, and the effects last. The price point is even reasonable. The ONLY thing I don't like about this is the fragrance. It smells like unbrand hotel room body lotion, and it's strong. I really wish this were fragrance-free to make it literally the perfect moisturizer, but for the price I can deal. This honestly works better for me than Clinique's Moisture Surge did. I would highly recommend, just be aware that this does have a strong, unfortunate scent.

I have been needing something like this for a few weeks now and was hesitant to purchase it based on the somewhat hefty price, but I'm so glad I finally caved.

I am so excited that this moisturizer literally gets sucked into my skin the second I put it on. It smells clean and fresh, not sure why some reviews say otherwise. It's a gel that is slightly watery, so you really need only a fingertip of it, it glides on smooth and you can tell this will last a long time.

I have mild cystic acne and I've watched those tiny annoying bumps go away since using this (along with some other new products: nip and fab glycolic fix gel 3x a week at night, the neutrogena transparent facial bar, Dickson a witch hazel toner...but even without those this moisturizer is just great). I kinda wish it came in a pump bottle but it's no big deal.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"When I bought this product, I was on the hunt for a moisturizer that was suitable for oily & acne-prone skin, but didn't have any salicylic acid in it. Though I have oily skin, I still want a moisturizer that makes my skin feel supple and soft, while at the same time does not exacerbate my oiliness. This product did exactly that! I loved it! It feels extremely light-weight on the skin and has a wonderful, slightly cooling sensation. I've used both at night and during the day. It also works fantastically under makeup. It soaks into the skin quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. As a bonus, it has a nice, clean smell to it and I like the packaging - it looks fancy. I would recommend this product to oily skinned people, like me, who want a moisturizer that actually moisturizes. I think it would work very well for combination and normal skin as well. I don't think it would be moisturizing enough for dry skin though.",3

Very oily t-zone and extremely dry under eyes (the rest is normal) so I have been struggling to find something very refreshing for my under eyes that will give them some moisture.

Sadly, the jar is big so don't get your hopes up, you are not getting a ton of product. It's like a bag of chips, all air. Thankfully, it's good air (or I wouldn't have bought a back up already).

I use this morning and evening, always after I shower and wash my face because that's when I notice my skin is at its driest. The gel is very cooling and soothing to my skin. I don't have an issue with the smell at all. My face is very sensitive and prone to breakouts on occasion. I didnt notice that it helped to increase breakouts nor did it diminish it. This does not get rid of, diminish, or smooth my pores, but it doesn't promise to do that, just to smooth and hydrate your skin, which is definitely does. Both myself and my boyfriend have noticed that my face is definitely smoother and softer and he loves it.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,"Let me make this clear: My skin is acne prone... VERY acne prone, and gets oily very quickly. And recently I've found that moisturizers actually regulate my skin very effectively and help to drastically keep oil production down. I bought this product as a daily moisturizer to use every morning before starting my makeup routine. I wanted something that would feed my skin moisture continuously throughout the day to keep my skin feeling bouncy, nourished, and soft all day. I wanted something a little less overwhelming than my usual moisturizer for the day time. I thought about getting the Aqua Bomb by Belief, but thought this may be a good dupe. It screamed hydration, and I've heard a ton of good things about it, so I thought I would give it a whirl. Whoo! However, I'm so upset, because it did absolutely nothing for my skin! I don't get it! It's not like I have extremely dry skin either. Pros: I love how it applies. Very cooling, gel like feel that spreads easily so a little goes a long way. Nice! Every day I put it on, did my makeup, and bam, I was out the door. It was only an hour or so into my day when I began to notice it: my skin feels dry... what the heck. Dry? Am I going crazy? I touch my skin and it feels tight and parched. What is this madness!? And all day it felt so dry and awful. Every single day it was like this, and my skin was miserable. Eventually I just gave up, because I couldn't stand it anymore. This moisturizer is just straight garbage and had no business being on my skin, plain and simple. If it works well for you, I'm jealous, because I really wanted it to work, especially for the nice price tag, but I guess it was just too good to be true :(",3

I live in FL where it's either warm or hot so hate anything that leaves a sticky feeling--this completely absorbs quickly. I'm on my second jar and will definitely continue to use this.

I put it on in the car because I couldn't wait and it felt amazing. It feels so cool, refreshing, and doesn't dry my face out (I have combo of oily and dry). Plus it smells really good.

Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I really liked this product when it first came out. It was really moisturizing and went on smooth....then they changed the product and added this unnatural ridiculous blue coloring and this strangely manish scent. I found these changes to be a major turn off and will look for a better product to take its place.,4
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,I am on my second jar of this lovely gel I would never want to be without it. I have a terrible oily T-zone and this gel magically controls my oil. It moisturizes and absorbs so nice and the scent is very pleasant.

I decided to try this and after 2 weeks I noticed the change. Before, my makeup would stick to dry patches and look terrible after a few hours. Since I have been using this day AND night, my makeup looks great all throughout the day. This product is absolutely amazing for anyone who has very dry skin and it's not expensive at all compared to high end products.",5

So soft and absorbs right away. You feel clean and fresh and soft alllll day. Nothing greasy, nothing heavy, but very effective. I find myself stroking my cheeks because they are so smooth for the first time in years. I look forward to moisturizing my face! I have combination skin, I can get greasy throughout the day, but I also get dryness and starting to age (I'm 37).

I put a layer on after I got out of the shower and it felt good for the 1st 5 minutes. Then I felt like I needed another layer. Then another. I have combination skin and it didn't feel hydrating enough for me. Certain parts of my skin still felt very tight. This may be a good option for someone in a humid environment, since it's very light.",5
Neutrogena,Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask,$4.99,This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It absorbs quickly and lasts all day.

I have never been a fan of product I had to dip my fingers into to apply - I prefer pumps or squeeze tubes, but don't mind this at all because this product has been amazing for my skin. It absorbs quickly and fully into my skin and doesn't leave behind a greasy feeling. I've only had this for a few days, but I have used it every morning before putting on my makeup and every night after cleansing before bed. I do have to say that if I get this *too* close to my eyes, it does irritate a little, but it is easily calmed by either wiping off the product or blending it further away from my eye.",4

I decided to try this because I didn't like splurging $39.00 for Clinique. This is the holy grail of moisturizers. In my opinion, this is a cheaper duplicate to Clinique's moisture surge. I love the gel like texture and the fact that it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy. I have very oily skin and a lot of moisturizers I've used have made my skin greasy and unclean feeling.
