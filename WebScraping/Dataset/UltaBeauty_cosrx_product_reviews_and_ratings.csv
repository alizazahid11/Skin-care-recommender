COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I was looking for a product that makes my skin glow, and this is it! I am in my early 50s and live in the Midwest. Winter is here, and my skin was starting to look dull. This product is a game-changer!",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I tried this out because it's raved about and was really excited to try. I usually have pretty smooth to the touch, but dry skin. It did give my skin a more brightened look and what felt like a ""firming"" feeling which was nice, but every morning after using it when I'd be washing my face, I noticed my skin felt textured all the sudden when it wasn't before. Especially on my forehead. This never broke me out in pimples/full on breakout but just texture/bumps that felt like they were under the skin. I would skip using it for for a night or two and my skin would calm down. I stopped using it at all and just recently tried again just to be 100% certain it doesn't work for me before giving away or throwing away, and the same thing - texture across my forehead & now jaw. I do love the brightening & overall feel of this product just isn't for me. I also do have slight shellfish & histamine allergy that I've seen some other people mention, which I think attributed.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,After I started using snail mucin in my skincare routine I noticed so many changes. I used to have very oily skin and breakouts constantly but i found that this product has helped a lot with that,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"despite the fact that this brand is kind of a relic, I still think that snail essence is still a bomb.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I'm a fair skinned Latina and have dry, pretty nontextured skin, sometimes combo skin when it's hot in the summer. Was so excited to try this, have seen so many tiktok and youtube channels rave about this, but everytime id use it, id end up with textured skin. Usually i can run my finger around my face and its soft/smooth but everytime after using this, the next day, id have what felt like teeny tiny bumps/uneven texture. It never broke me out into pimples or anything, and it did do a good job at ""firming"" the skin where it felt like the moisturizing propreties were doing their job correctly, but the feeling of textured bumps underneath the skin was enough to get me to stop using it. Since having stopped using it, my skins smooth again/no texture. Just writing a review to remind that not everything we see being raved about will work for your skin type necessarily.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I am on the spectrum and precise product output means a lot to me because, otherwise, I have to talk myself out of not freaking out. My beauty products need to have a pump or they need to be easy for me to evenly count. I think in numbers. Two pumps/applications works wonders! I love the even glassy look it provides. I love that it layers well with other products, regardless of brand or product type. Keep up the good work!",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Wonderful,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I usually use this product at night. Its very hydrating and I love that for the nighttime. I like to add moisturizer on too of it after about 5-10 minutes to lock it in (not sure that really does anything but i like to think it does?). It also brightens my skin tone and makes it look firm.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I've loved other COSRX products and heard great things about this syrum, but unfortunately, it caused hives on my face. After some research, I learned that people with shellfish allergies might react to snail mucin due to the similar proteins found in both species, which are often what trigger allergic reactions. These proteins are present in the mucin, so if you have seafood allergies, I recommend caution even though this product is advertised as hypoallergenic. It seems to work wonders for others, but it wasn't a match for me.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,holy moly i love this stuff. i have been using it for just over a month and i havent had a pimple since ive started! normally mosturizers feel wicked heavy on my skin and break me out but this makes my skin glow and absorbs so quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated!!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"It made my face glow at first, then the second day it gave me a bunch of pimples.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"After living in Korea for a short time and having a best friend who is Korean-American, I can attest beautiful skin starts with great skin care. I have switched to Korean skincare products and it has been life changing. This product has helped control my redness from Rosacea, my face feels so soft, and hydrated. I love that it has no scent, a little goes a long way and absorbs well. I have super sensitive skin and this does not irritate me whatsover.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,the second i put this on my skin it felt inflamed and i broke out in little red dots and pimples. i was sad since so many people like it but after looking at reviews this is an uncommon reaction. i tired it a second time for good measure and had the same reaction,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Recommended this to my friend,1
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This is the one product I was introduced to via K beauty creators and has stuck around in my routine years and years later. I will repurchase time and time again. I have sensitive skin and my skin type used to be acne prone and greasy and I used it then and now it is drier and clear (thanks to isotret) and I still use it! It never irritated my skin and always felt great. There is no scent too which is a plus.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This is probably my 3rd or 4th bottle! It's really helped my redness, and has boosted my skin's moisture. Can't recommend enough",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,i didnt realize how much i'll love it till i finished it. once i ran out of this my makeup didnt look the same. i use it before anything in my makeup routine and right when im done washing my face,5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have dry skin, T zone is a little more oily and I saw online that proper moisturizing can help with acne. I mainly had breakouts on my chin and forehead. Since using it my acne has significantly improved and I do feel like it brightened my skin a little after like a week or two of using it. It's super moisturizing and feels great. My skin tends to be a little sensative and this product has been amazing! I recommend it to everyone. It is a little slimmy but you get use to it. I use two pumps, sort of rub my hands together a little to disburse it and then I pat it on to my face; then I follow with moisurrizer.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Good,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,The only thing I would add is to add the other ingredients on the packaging,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"At first, I was skeptical. Snail mucin? Sounded kinda gross. But I'm glad I tried it. A little goes a long way. I apply on damp skin and my skin is looking so much better. It looks more even and my fine lines appear more filled in after about 5 weeks of use. Definitely a great product.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Leaves my skin silky,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I do like the formula of this it glides very easily onto the skin, but also absorbs very well. I put this on top of my hyaluronic acid and then I put my moisturizer on and my skin feels amazing. You can use this morning and night time. Also great for oily skin great for dry skin.",4
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"cannot believe it took me so long to try this product. it's so plumping my elevens are mostly gone. I use 2 pumps, 2 times a day. lasts forever. I've had the bottle for 4 months and still have at least half a bottle. my redness is gone and never breaks me out. absorbing and goes great under a moisturizer and/or foundation.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I wanted to love this so bad. I used it for about a week and an half and my skin looked fantastic!!! But, then I started getting red bumps down my jaw and neck. Painful. And I haven't seen anyone else say this… but my hair started growing thicker in those areas? Super weird. It felt like fungal acne or eczema, which I have never had in those areas or ever.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I was not aware of this product but I love the way it makes my skin feel.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I dont really break out that much but this made my skin break out in pimples everywhere, it was vey unpleasant.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have combonation-dry, senstive, acne prone skin. My skin type is very difficult to find the right skincare product. When i do find it, I stick to it. This is serum I would repurchase again and again and again!!! Only when winter time, you need more moisturizing cream to go with it. For Spring/sunmer season it is beyond perfect!!!!",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I bought this, after being influenced from tiktok, and while I was using it I would get this super terrible ichy rashes all over my chin and my neck, so please be careful when deciding to buy, you might be allergic!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I buy this product all the time!! it helps so much with my dry skin and it pairs so well with any hyaluronic acid. it helps my skin so much and it always feels so nice afterwards.,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,After seeing this all over my fyp i caved and its AMAZING!!! Its so hydrating and makes my skin feel so plump and soft. I use this stuff every day after toner and loveeeee. Also bonus that no snails were hurt in the process.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I've been using the COSRX Snail Mucin for a long time and am on my third bottle. I find it very soothing on my skin and have never had a reaction to it. My skin appears brighter and more hydrated when I'm using it. I've noticed an increased healing time if I have any irritation. When I skip it for a few days, I do lose that glow. There's no fragrance. It sinks in quickly to my skin.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This product has really helped with my skin's oil production. I live in high humidity weather and am constantly searching for products to help with oil control. I use it in the am after my vitamin c serum and it layers beautifully. I use it some nights as well. I was skeptical when i first purchased but I can honestly say i noticed a diffence within 2 days of use. It is a little bit slimy but it absorbs well and a little goes a long way. It is well priced for the quantity and i cant wait to try other products in this line!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Listen, I do think this is an amazing product and definitely moisturized my skin, but I won't lie, I do think this product is overhyped. It didn't do as much as I thought it would. Overall, great product and would recommend for bumpy skin.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This is a must use product. For anyone thay says its ""greasy"" or ""stick"" isnt apptlign it right. Wet your face and apply woth your favorite serum, i promise it will absorb perfectly. This product does exactly what it says it does. It works well with other products.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I wanted to like this so badly but it made my skin more textured :( pores looked bigger, skin was oilier, and forehead whiteheads were popping up more frequently",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Makes the skin feel so nice and smooth. So mosturizing,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,light weight,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I originally bought this product a year ago. Went through two bottles while I was upping my skinscare game. I had changed so much in such a short time that I was crediting my other products more, so I didnt rebuy. After a few months I just noticed my skin wasnt looking as good as it had been. I assumed it was becuase I was traveling, or stressed with work or whatever else. Then I was looking st my skin care thibking what can I do to bring like back to my skin, make it glowy, less textured again? Then I realized the only thing I had changed was not using this anymore. I repurchased bot even a week ago and can already see my best skin coming back. As someone who thought it was all hype I can honestly say it makes the biggest differnece and I will definitely keep rebuying",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This worked really well for me and would buy again.,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I wanted to love it like evryone else but it did not do much for me. My skin did not have any reactions nor did it improve while use. This product did give a feel of hudration but quickly dried and then I felt the need to put on more mosturizer.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Really wanted to like this product after all the rave on Tiktok. Unfortunately, it broke me out with fungul acne under my skin. I dont have sensitive skin either. Although it does make the skin look moisturized, it did not work for me long term:(",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"i dont normally get acne but the past few months i was getting little flare ups and i decided i needed to try a new skincare brand out. i use cosrx cleansing gel (OBSESSED) then apply the essense, then the cream (+their retinoid at night) and omg my skin looks sooo good. i was going for the ""glass skin"" look and these products have given me that honey!! HIGHLY recommend. i wanna add a pic for proof but idk how…",4
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"A friend recommended this product to me. I have bad acne, super dry skin, and eczema and have had trouble with my face for years. It only took me a few uses of this product to drastically see a difference on red irritated areas. I also saw a huge difference to the dryness of my skin and how soft it made my face. It absorbs super quickly and perfect under my Clinique Moisture surge. I will probably use this product for the rest if my life. My face now feels hydrated, clear, and soft.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This was recommended to me to help with acne, but it only made it worse.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Really wanted to like this product but it broke me out,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Favorite product,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Love the Corsx Mucin!! Its a must in my everyday and night skin routine! It makes my skin so soft and clear while keeping it youthful!! Highly recommend,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I wanted to love this product so much! Yet I was surprisingly disappointed. I am someone who rarely gets breakouts and overall has pretty healthy clear skin. I began noticing breakouts within the week of utilizing this product. I was using it morning and night as a toner replacement. At first, I couldn't narrow down what product it was. So, I began doing some research and that is when I eliminated it from my routine and within three days, noticed that the breakouts began clearing up. This may be a better fit for someone who has extremely dry skin and is not acne prone by any means.",3
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"As someone who has struggled with makeup application due to a dry skin type, this product has been an absolute game changer. After adding this product to my routine, I have found I never struggle with dry spots throughout the day, and even on days where my skin gets irritated from exfoliating, makeup removal, or acne flare ups, this product soothes my skin and leaves me feeling absolutely refreshed. Cant recommend it enough!",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,After the first use you can definitely tell a big difference my face used to be beat up with acne and they're clearing up so fast!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I use this morning and night along with the cream. I love this brand. Definitely recommend.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Great product, however it is half the price Ulta charges with other online retailers. Do not waste your money buying it from here.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Hydrating but broke me out. There are way better products are there that won't clog your pores.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I love this product! It's worked so good for me! I love the texture of it and how smoothly it applies / feels onto my face and after being absorbed into the skin for a while it definitely brightens and makes my face shine like glass . So worth it!,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This product is amazing! I wasn't sure what to expect when I applied it to my face. I was amazed on how smooth it actually looked and it also had a plumbing effect and not to mention dewy as well. I will continue to purchase.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,My cousin and me both use a lot of different products from this brand. I love this product so much. I found that it's most effective if you wash ur face first then use this then do a serum and moistizer.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I bought one from ulta and the other from amazn. The ulta is less thick, and the amaz is thicker. I can feel the difference. The both absorb pretty well. Ulta is a tad bit more absorbing. Amazn absorbs well too. I really dont which one is the fake or genuine one. The difference is in viscosity, which i can tell.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I got one from ulta and the other from the biggest e-commerce in usa that begins with the letter A prime. I noticed that both are different. I don't know which one is real one. You can put in lubricant from KY, and I still don't know. They are pretty much same but with a slight dewy texture.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I guess i might be one of those strange cases of ppl allergic to this. I hear so much about it but it broke me out so bad,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I was really sad to see that this broke me out because of all the hype that i see and because i genuinly find this to be a nice product. Within a few hours the acne on my forehead reappeared and i started to break out there way more. I dont know if its just because i have combination skin where its more oily there but it didnt really work great.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This gave my face a bumpy texture and dulled my complexion. BUT, i have some small to medium sized patches of psoriasis on various sites around my body that this helps more than anything else I've tried, in some cases better even than rx steroid and d3 ointments (iykyk). I do maybe once/month use the rx ointment to boost, but seriously this stuff is unbelievable. BTW, I tried the peach slices version thinking the addition of cica derivatives would help, but it didn't, symptoms came back immediately so after 2 days switched back to this.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Listen girls the hype is real! At first I hated this because in the beginning it was breaking me out. I didn't use it for a while then I came back to it and it has completely changed my skin! It looks so dewy and moisturized where before I was really dry. I use this after washing and toning and I top it with my serum anf moisturizer. It's transformed my againg skin. I highly recommend. I also love the eye cream in this line. I'm 36 with sensitive, aging, dry, acne prone skin. It has helped with texture and wrinkles as well as firmness and pigmentation. I definitely recommend but give it time. I apply 3 pumps to my face and neck morning and night.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I recently added this to my skin care routine, I think it came as a sample in my last order. I just turned 60 and my skin has started looking older with fine lines and wrinkles as well as age spots. After about a week I noticed how much smoother and younger my skin looks. It takes just a small amount so a little goes a long way. I do use it under my eyes and haven't had any issues and it has helped with wrinkles/fine lines. I noticed that others were asking about that so I thought I'd mention it in my review. The price looks very reasonable so, when I get low, I WILL be buying this. Thank you for the sample, it pays to send them out as I will keep buying/using it in the future. You have a customer for life.",3
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"It was ok to use on my face., then I saw that it for my face. firmed. it But do not use on your butt",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Ive noticed my face is much brighter and has a more natural dewy look. I think it makes my skin breakout here and there. However i really like the difference its made in my skin so I will keep it in my routine.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I loved this I used to have little bumps on my face and forehead and after this andd the cerave face wash my skin in so clear and glowing I get compliments from people at school! Buy this now!!!!,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I've started using this daily in concurrence with my cerave cleanser and the tower 28 sos spray and my skin is looking so much better! my acne is clearing up and my acne scars/dark spots are fading nicely. it's hydrating to my dry patches but doesn't make the rest of my skin super oily.,3
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I've bought this product before & am going to buy again since I've used it on dark spots on my face & it definitely makes the dark spots fade away over time. Would definitely recommend this particular one!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I used it for a couple of days and after the first 2 days of using it day and night I noticed a plump glow to my skin appearance, on day 3 i woke up with acne above my lip and I assumed it was hormonal (in denial that this product was the problem) surely enough, I used it again (except only at night now) and my skin had a breakout the next day! It's unfortunate, but due to other's reviews I knew if I had fill blown acne attack, it'd be from this product, I also never break out this bad. I will be returning this.. I recommend using hylauronic acid if you want a cheaper product with similar benefits.. or do your research and find a snail mucin product that works for you.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This did so much more for my skin than I was even looking for. I have combo skin with very dry red skin that gets flaky and very oily nose and chin. I was looking for a moisturizer and after two uses this got rid of redness, and made cystic pimples with no white head just disappear. After the second use! After a week of use now the wrinkles around my eyes disappeared. I do use the moisturizer with this serum but do not put the moisturizer around my eyes so the serum took care of the wrinkles by itself.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"as a toner, it truly just gives nothing. its not as moisturizing as the serum. like i cannot give a great review because it just didnt do anything.",2

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This product is amazing! My skin is very oily but flaky and VERY prone to acne. This product did not cause any acne AT ALL. It really seems to soothe and hydrate my skin. I am very pleased with this product and have just purchased more items from their product line to try. Would highly recommend!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I use this about every other night and occasionally in the mornings and I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin.,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I had been interested in trying this product. It's light and refreshing. I haven't used it long enough to truly determine if I will experience better skin, but so far I'm enjoying it.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I love the way it feels on my skin,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I relaly like using this in the morning and evening. It leaves my skin feeling softer. Only con is the packaging, i find it difficult to control the amount I'm getting, but hopefully the full size has a better bottle. Will upfrade to the full size when im done with the travel!",4
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I discover this product by searching thru reddit… the comments weren't wrong. THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. Literally melts into your skin, so moisturing and smoothing. My skin tends to lean more on the drier side, especially after I cleanse my face. This product brought life back into my face. LOVE 10/10 good for sensitive skin as well",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I noticed results within the first week of using it. I've now been using it for a couple weeks now and only at night. My acne is gone and my acne scars have gotten lighter and NOTHING else has worked this well on the scars. My skin is more even and so soft. It is a miracle product which is shocking for the price!,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I usually wait a week before judging a skin care product I saw results in just 3 days!!!! My skin is much smoother and moistured . It has also helped my fade my healing acne on my face. It's worth the price!!!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Went through most of my first bottle and felt like it didn't do much so I stopped using it for a while. One day I picked it up again and realized it really does make a difference before applying moisturizer. Leaves my face shiny and helps with redness, it's very soothing. Just got my second bottle and I love the price.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This is a very popular essence/serum and I decided to try it after I ran out of my last serum. Unfortunately it is not moisturizing enough for my dry skin + winter air/indoor heat. I kept the other parts of my twice a day skincare routine the same and only changed this step, but even after several months using this, my skin more often than not requires another layer of my face cream. I've also noticed cracking and peeling on my face that I haven't seen in a very long time. I'm sad that this doesn't work for me but happy I only tried it in this small container vs the full size. Maybe I'll have better luck in summertime with it.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Definitely adding this to my regimen! It's been healing the acne scars on my cheeks. I'm usually oily so I only use this once at night and before applying retinol.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,A little goes a long way! I will definitely keep this as part of my skincare routine.,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have repurchased this product many times because I love it so much. This helps a lot with hydrating my skin, not so sure about fading dark spots, but the hydration factor is enough to make me repurchase. Also, I like that it doesn't have a scent.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I have always had extremely oily acne prone skin with lots of acne scars. my acne scars are pretty much gone now and I've been using this less than a month.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have been using snail products for years the amount you get, as well as the quality & easy to use bottle are all a win. Moisturizing without being greasy.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I've used this product for about 2-3 years now and have always loved till I refilled this week and the quality of the product has seemed to go down hill. it no longer has a mucin like texture more of a cheap glycerin texture. Probably will be switching to a other brand since this one is no longer doing it purpose.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Leaves your skin looking so beautiful, dewy, and plum.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This worked swimmingly on my skin - it w went on easy and I saw results within a few days. HOWEVER, I also coincidentally started experiencing minor throat tightness and coughing during the time I started using the snail essence. I thought this was GERD, but it never cleared up. The only allergy I have is a severe one to dust mites. A Benadryl and discontinuation of the product has cleared up everything. I loved this product, and am SO BUMMED I can't use it.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"So pleased that i have gotten the basic line cleanser, toner, eye and moisturizer with the essence.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Listen. I've seen thie stuff recommended everywhere so I finally bought it. WOW. I love that it absorbs quickly and doesn't sit on the skin. My face feels so hydrated and plump after use! I honestly look forward to my skin care just so I can use this!,3
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This product has made my face super soft and hydrated but it does make my skin super shiny. I think I'd like the shiny look more when my skin clears up more. It has been helping with the texture of my skin which is a plus.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I loveeee this. Im on my 5th bottle. I love that you can use it daytime or nighttime and layer it over any actives to lock in moisture. It pairs really nicely with hyaluronic acid in particular and also retinol. It leaves your skin feeling and looking really smooth.,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I've been using this since early 2023 and I can honestly say that it's improved my skin a lot. It makes my skin softer and better moisturizerized. My skin doesn't get flaky as quickly as it used to. My smile lines aren't as noticeable. My skin looks bright and has a healthy glow to it. Whenever I stop using this for a few days my skin is noticeably worse than it is on days I do use it. Like, my skin gets flaky and dull looking and generally feels drier (this is the default state of my skin not a side effect of the serum). I wish I had an infinite supply of this serum. This serum is one of my holy grails.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I was skeptical about the effectiveness of the product but after finally using it consistently, day and night, before makeup and after washing my face, I can see a difference. I have dry and sometimes flaky skin, but this has kept my skin hydrated and so soft, even if I miss a day of using. This has become a staple in my skin routine!",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"okay so i had mid expectations going into this, and bought the travel size. but i just re bought the larger one because its so worth it!! i have noticed a difference on my skin and it cleared up, helping fade a bunch of acne scars and dark spots. i rarely break out unless its bc of stress or hormones bc of my full routine- adding this to it boosted that 100% i so reccomend. the only downside is its like.. goopy i guess but not in a bad way, it dries well and doesn't dry out my skin (i have very sensitive skin)",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Bought for the supposed positive effects on rosacea. This just does not agree with my facial skin —dry, aging (mild rosacea t-zone)—leaves my pores more visible and accentuates fine lines, and texture, BUT it works wonders on dry & psoriasis patches, including ones that have not responded to other excellent, ceramide-filled products. Within 2 applications, the super dry patches on the back of my ears, were cured. Using it on other dry patches but nowhere else. To be sure, I have tried it layered over only mist and HA serum, and also under thick nighttime moisturizer and both ways it dulls and texturizes my skin. On it's own, it left my skin tight. On the plus, I do have dust allergies, but have not broken out.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I wanted to give this a shot after seeing how much people seem to love it, but it irritated my skin like none other. Put it on at night and woke up to puffy, red, sensitive skin. When I saw this I went and washed my face with my normal cleanser to get rid of any remnants of it and instantly my face looked and felt better. This was so peculiar to me as my skin is not sensitive and I typically do not have reactions to new skin care. I wish it would've worked!",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,One of the best skin care products,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This product destroyed my skin. I had an allergic reaction causing my eyelids to swell and burn and itch. Caused a rash all over my face and neck. Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"The Cosrx Snail Mucin Power Essence has become my skincare holy grail! This essence has completely transformed my skin, leaving it hydrated, plump, and radiant. I was initially skeptical about using snail mucin in my skincare routine, but I'm so glad I gave it a try. This essence is incredibly lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin, providing deep hydration without any greasiness. I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture and elasticity of my skin since incorporating this product. It's helped fade acne scars and hyperpigmentation, giving me a more even complexion. Plus, it's gentle enough for my sensitive skin and hasn't caused any irritation. I can't recommend the Cosrx Snail Mucin Power Essence enough – it's truly a game-changer!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,it not only helped repair my skin barrier but fades acne scars/hyperpigmentation!! the consistency can be off putting to some but definitely worth it.,1

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I saw this being used in a youtube video about 3-4 years ago and i gave it a try and have never turned back! Its great for my dry skin, really evens out my texture. I always use this after my moisture sealant and then the rest of my steps. I have very dry skin and keep in mind, this is to help with anti-aging long term and is NOT a moisturizer. Just one pump is needed and lasts about 6-8 months!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,love it,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have had this products for over a months and have used it consistently while following steps on how to apply this ""correctly"" and I havent noticed that it does anything.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I don't think this is a bad product but it's not for me. Apparently the protein in snail mucin is very similar to the proteins found in dust mites and shellfish. Therefore, if you're allergic to one it's likely you're allergic to the other. I have a pretty significant dustmite allergy and didn't know about this connection and had a bad reaction.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This product caused red spots all over my face. Didn't want to give up on it so I tried it again a couple weeks later. Same thing. At least I got it half off so I wasn't out too much money. Bummer.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I used the whole bottle of this and I couldnt figure out why I was breaking out so bad. I chalked it up to being pregnant.

It tends to be dry. I'm in my early 30s so blemishes happen but are not common for me. No matter what state my skin is in, I can apply this without it burning when other products fail.

Happy to say I've had no interactions and actually love this product so much! I'm 52 and suffer from skin that can become dry quickly. This has been so lovely in keeping my skin really supple. I use it at night and sometimes in the morning. It's not slimy; it feels really smooth/slick and it absorbs quickly. Really nice product!",4.7

But I also have found this to be the case with barrier-building skin care, like byoma products/peptide creams, etc. And I have very sensitive skin. Once you adjust to it, this will make your skin softer than EVER. It's worth the adjustment I promise. I couldnt believe it was my skin when I touched it.

Powder stuff should be fine tho. Does smell weird too lol.",5

It also made my skin super oily after an hour which rarely happens to me. I had to go home and wash my face, it looked and felt that bad.

I also tried using it in different ways to see if it was just because of my application and still no difference. Everyones skin is different though but unfortunately didn't work for me.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,So excited to ckntinue seeing the benefits. This product has been amazing on my skin so far.,3
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I was expecting to see a glow on my skin. The product that i just received is very watery and just dries out in literally 5 seconds. I'm still trying to understand what type of skin it works on. Maybe it does not work for my dark tone.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"i love this so much, it works well under my makeup and makes my skin feel soo good!",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I tried based on jaclyn h. Review and push to buy on her IG. The texture/feel doesnt bother me but it just doesnt work with my skin, since using it i started getting big cyst-like pimples and an itchy red rash on my neck (not hotmones Im in my 30s and havebt gitten true breakouts since i was 16. Its the only thing different ive been using and i only used in the mornings since i do a retinol serum at night. Might be great for people who can tolerate it.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"My pregnancy gave me incredibly dry skin - I had dry patches all over my cheeks and chin. After using this, I don't have to reapply my moisturizer after an hour or apply Vaseline. My skin remains and stay hydrated",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I always thought snail mucin was revolting, but I saw so many videos were people swear up & down it's the best thing. Not for me! I will admit that my skin at first looked very silky, like glass-skin, but after a few days I started having a rosacea reaction- pimples all over, and even developed closed comedones around my nose. I would stop for a few days & then try again - same thing. So if you have rosacea or sensitive skin, you might wanna skip this one.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I was warned that several if my friends who used it ended up being sensitive/allergic to it, but I tried it and have used it morning and night for the last week and I am a huge fan. I do use with the nyx marshmallow primer and yhe van man honey and tallow balm and my skin has never been better. My fine lines are reduced, my skin is brighter and more hydrated, and i have allover had less skin irritations and redness.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I use it twice a day agter using all my other fave products. It didnt break me out, you only need abojt two little pumps of it and follow up with a moisturizer.",4.7

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I read about this product and waited awhile before trying considering it was snail mucin. I finally took the plunge about a month ago and I'm glad that I did. It isn't gross feeling like I thought. Very hydrating and has helped my skin look much better. I'm 62 and I have to say that I can't exactly put my finger on it but my skin looks fresher and glowing. I always use moisturizer and sunscreen after applying the essence. Just ordered another bottle. This will stay in my regimen.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I mean yea it makes your skin look plump & dewy but only until it dries. Them it's absolutely pointless tbh. Been using it for over a year waiting for somthing special to happen based on the hype but nope, just like sticky water.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"My dermatologist recommended that I try snail mucin for extra hydration for my dry, middle aged skin. I am not prone to acne and did not have any breakouts from this. I have an extensive skincare regimen and put this on after treatment serums but before moisturizer/night cream. It helps provide another layer of hydration. My skin has looked less flaky and more glowy since using this product. It is a bit slimy, but you get used to that. I use a pea-sized amount for my whole face and haven't noticed any scent at all from this product.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I've been using this product for about a week now and it has completely changed the state of my skin.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I used this product for three nights and I actually loved that my skin looked hydrated and felt moisturized each morning after. However, the morning after the third night, I noticed a cluster of skin colored bumps on my jawline. It was a reaction I have never had from a product before. (This was the only new product I was trying at the time as well) It went away within the next couple days after I stopped using the product. Really bummed because I did love how this made my skin look and feel.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Might help others but did not do anything to my face but make it irritated.,2

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Took me a month of fungal acne, cystic acne, and bad skin texture to realize this was the cause and not my hormones. Stopped using it and a week later my skin was completely different.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Wonderful product that has really helped my dry, sensitive skin stay hydrated. Highly recommend.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I HIGHLY suggest if you want to try this product to get the full size. If you just want a travel friendly version, i still would recommend the full size and a travel container that has a pump or is a squeezy tube. This mini wouldhave been perfect if not for the large hole you are supposed to pour the product from. It is highly wasteful especially with the consistency of the product itself.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,So soothing to the irritated skin. Very hydrating.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This was my first time trying the product due to the hype I had been seeing and I'm so happy I did! Combined with my other products my skin is looking good.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Ok so i was very worried about slimy stuff on my face. I have to say its not a gross slimy lol! I wasnt sure when to put it on. Literally everything says after toner. I did put it on after toner and then used my other stuff after. What i thought would take forever to absorb didnt. My skin sucked it up! Skin wasnt sticky or gross it felt very soft. I put on my normal stuff and it all went on so nice and my skin felt amazing after! Next morning my skin was so plump and soft. Im usually a little red and it wasnt there! I have lots of scaring from skin issues and that wasnt as red as it normally is. I will definitely update in a few more weeks!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Saw on tik tok and got influenced, but I love this snail muccin. I was hesitant at first because I do have sensitive skin, but after reading through the reviews it looks like you really just have to try the product to see if it works for your skin or not. It will either be a godsend or break you out it seems like",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I really wanted to like this since so many people reccomended it. Unfortunately it was too much for my skin. It BURNED when i put it on. I started getting red patches and breaking out everywhere. I heard snail mucin can be an irritant to some who have sensitive skin. This is definitley true. Overall it seems most people like this and I just don't have the right skin type for it. Dry, sensitive skin havers avoid this!!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I love this product so much everything abt it is great smell, hydrating, moisturizing. But the feeling and slimyish feeling is werid and known its snail mucin is funny 😆",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Love this product my skin has never felt so soft and I have had 0 new pimples. My scars are fading and my skin has never been better !!!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I've used this for years but stopped recently maybe because my skin changed. I would recommend you keep this in a cool area or refrigerated! It helps with the texture because the texture is quite odd. This product has to dry before you can really do anything but overall it feels lile its helped the elasticity of my skin!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Caused a bunch of fungal acne on my jaw line area going up my cheeks!! Do bot use this its not as good as you think 😩 i thiught i mt was good but it is not!!! Ruined my face !,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I seen a lot of people using this incorrectly. Which i made that mistake at first too. Acter using it correctly it has made a difference in the hydration if my face. Very moisturizing!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,if you have sensitive skin this is a big no. it will break you out. you will think its helping you until its not… it took me awhile to write this review cause i wanted to get to the root of which product was suddenly breaking me out. and guess what??? this is the one. I am am an esthetician and have talked to multiple people that have used it and they are still getting breakouts to this day. its probably too late for me to return unfortunately. save your money and stick to the basics :/,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,You know the reviews where people say I've only been using this for three days but my acne scars are almost gone from this stuff….dont believe that. This product can and will draw moisture into your skin if you put it on damp skin. So the plumping effect you get might make it seem like scars are disappearing. But its not 3 day scar disappearing miraculous. Now unfortunately I have super sensitive acne prone skin and this broke me out. I also gave it plenty of time in case it was a purge. But alas it wasnt. It just didnt work for me. So be cautious if you also have this skin type.,1
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Granted — I've only been using it for a few days now and will follow up with an update but I've had SO many breakouts since I using this serum and the face wash. I haven't had these many pimples in so long and was super excited to try it but.. maybe it isn't for me or my fellow oily girlies. Also, it accentuates my pores like CRAZY. Blegh. I will give it the 3 to 4 weeks so I can give it an actual chance. Praying for no more pimples and for my pores to not be visible from space. Also, if it's not for oily people then that's on me for not doing proper research!",1
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I was using the snail mucin mask from Peach Slices, and I loved it so much I really wanted to incorporate snail mucin into my everyday routine. I heard a lot of good things about this product, so I gave it a shot because I was suffering from severely dehydrated skin and a massive breakout caused by an allergy. My skin was noticeably more plump, hydrated, and calm after just a single use. My inflammation and breakouts have minimized. Also, I really recommend patting this into the skin instead of rubbing it. I have found it absorbs much better that way (this goes for most products in general).",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"It caused little bumps all over my forehead. Although it makes my skin feel great and is oddly refreshing, it immediately caused my forehead to breakout. This was the only adjustment in my daily routine and I noticed it after day 2. It started with one small bump, next day i had like three, by day 5 i had 12 :( it gots to go unfortunately.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Not once in my life has my skin EVER looked as bad as it does now, I took my chance after seeing this all over tiktok most people saying its good but also others saying that this will make you breakout. My skin type is normal and I've NEVER had more than 3 pimples at one time , my skin is now textured and I've broken out all over, I don't know what to do this has never happened to me, I wish I never took the chance and got this product, within a week all this happened. I've had so many breakdowns because of this, it's really depressing and I'm really sad this happened , I've never felt so ugly and I wish I never got this product. DONT GET THIS YOU MIGHT REGRET IT.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Thin consistency, easily spreads, MUST HAVE A DAMP FACE WHILE PUTTING IT ON! It's a humectant so it draws moisture to it. But does not create moisture. Use a moisturizer after to seal it in and you will see the results. It doesn't break me out and it's soothing. Definitely recommend!",1
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I highly recommend this product, there is a couple of fakes out there so please don't be mistaken. I also think a lot of people get this confused, but im not 100 precent sure as I am not an expert. But this product is much more effective for acne, rather then any other skin cancer ( as dry skin, oily skin, pores, etc.). But depending on your skin type it may be able to help in those ares to hydrate and soften your skin!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I usually don't leave reviews, but I had to for this product. I've been using this product for a few months, and I can notice a difference in my skin. I do suffer from acne, and I believe I have combo skin. I usually use 3 pumps on my face, and a couple on my neck. It has helped reduce the oiliness on my skin. This product helped so much with my acne/texture too. I didn't realize that I had a damaged skin barrier until I tried this product. It is very moisturizing, and it leaves my skin brighter and dewy. There have been times where I slacked on my skincare or skipped this product, and I could definitely notice a difference when I didn't use this product. My skin looks so much healthier with it, and I'm really happy I tried this product. I was hesitate at first because I heard this product might not work for you if you have issues with dust (it's related to the snail mucin ingredient). However, I would totally recommend it to anyone who is thinking about trying it! I will definitely be repurchasing this in the future!",4.7

My skin was hydrated, plumpy and looked youthful. One random night I had used it and started feeling itchy and breaking out in a rash. All over my face and neck. I was having an allergic reaction. Since it was the newest product I was using, I stopped using it. Everything went back to normal. Though, I was left with tiny little itchy red bumps on my forehead that come and go. I decided to give it another try 3 weeks later and the same thing happpend all over again. It might be good at first… but watch out 🫣",5

It's all over TikTok as this holy grail for skin care, and I have to say I'm pretty impressed so far. I have dealt with really bad cystic acne that left my face pretty scarred, and I don't want to speak too soon but my scars seem to be going away and my face seems to be glowing. I use this product then use a moisturizer and I just go about my day! Also, this product is sticky, but is absorbed by the skin very quickly and does not leave a residue behind.",4.7

Its sticky and then sits on top of your face all day, not sure it's doing anything for my face. So many swear by it so I really tried. I really dont think this does anything deep in your skin at all, i dont think it penetrates down and i think it inhibits other products from working if you put anything on after this.

I also wore it on special occasians because I felt it made my skin look amazing. Although I didnt like how I needed days after for my skin to recover. It is very sticky although it absorbs on your skin you dont notice. I usually dab product on 5 points but cant with this one because the ""slime"" stretches lol and can get in eyes or on mouth.

I started using this which reduced the redness, and got rid of my blemishes it also sucked allllll the moisture into my skin FAST (I needed it).

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This essence serum I use to layer on my face after I exfoliate/wash and use FAB's or the Body Shop's vitamin C treatments. I then use the COSrx snail essence and finish with the PTR peptide 21 moisturizer. This has an amazing product to help keep my skin from drying. I use 1 to 2 pumps and that seems to be plenty for my face. I consider myself to have skin on the drier side as well as on the sensitive side so I would recommend this product to anyone who wants an extra moisture boost. It has a slight stickiness to it but it seems to meld well with moisturizer to then melt into your skin. Great product and at a very fair price in my opinion as well.,5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,My skin has been so dry since moving to Colorado 4 years ago. I have tried EVERYTHING under the sun. I've managed to get it under control using The Ordinary products but decided to incorporate this snail mucin. MY SKIN FEELS PHENOMENAL. My skin genuinely feels good after using this. I am not prone to breakouts so nothing like that for me but I have seen people say that it cause them to break out. I would highly recommend to anyone struggling with moisture retention.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I'd heard about this all of Tiktok and of course I had to check it out. I wanted to purchase a small size first to make sure it improved my skin.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I use this in conjunction with the snail moisturizer and i am super snail!!! Im so beautiful! Skin is glowy and perfect!!,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"i just bought this product today and i am going to keep using it in hopes that the red itchy rash is just a result of a new product being used on my sensitive skin, but after using the snail mucin, my skin broke out in red, itchy rashes. i read about snail mucin online and found that people who have an allergy to dust mites might be allergic to snail mucin, so that might be why some people like me are breaking out. otherwise, the product itself is great. it doesn't feel slimy, it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft where it didn't break out, and you get a lot of product for how much it costs, which isn't much at all—it's very affordable. there is no noticable fragrance and it absorbs quickly. i'm hoping this works out for me, i've heard such great things online about the benefits of snail mucin. crossing my fingers that i'm not allergic🤞",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"If 0 stars were an option thats what this would get. Never in my life have I ever experienced this type of acne. Prefacing this by saying i didn't change any other steps in my longstanding skincare routine. As a result of using this for about a week i have developed fungal acne. Its painful, it's embarrassing, it doesnt respond to salycillic acid or benzoyle peroxide or other treatments. I am devastated. And on top of it i didnt find it to be that moisturizing, and i did use it on damp skin consistently and applied moisturizer on top as you're supposed to. In fact it made me overly dry and flaky. Again i applied it to damp skin!! I wish i was able to love and rave about this like everyone else because i was sooo excited to finally try it, but sadly no. For reference I have combo skin. My oily zones surprisingly were not the areas as drastically impacted by the fungal acne but rather my dry areas like my cheeks are covered in painful breakouts.",2

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I've lost count of how many times I've repurchased this essence. I have a travel bottle that goes with me on trips and always have an extra on hand.

I use it day and night and it layers perfectly with my other products.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This is the one product I've used for years without fail and will keep buying. So good for hydration! No scent, applies exactly like how you'd imagine snail mucin to work. I wear it before moisturizer morning and night.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I'm beyond obsessed with the snail mucin! There's no smell so don't worry about that. The texture can be a bit tacky but it goes away after it absorbs. My skin feels so hydrated & clean.,5

But, what really made me a super fan is when I had a severe eczema breakout. I tried EVERYTHING and nothing was working. Finally as a last resort, I layered on this essence with the LA Roche Posay Lipikar Balm moisturizer. Within a day, I started to see a difference and the pain and itching was going away. After a few days of regularly applying the two products, the rash is almost completely gone and isn't painful at all. (Note: I had used the La Roche product before, on its own and with other products. I really think the two together were the answer). Definitely recommend. Cannot recommend enough!",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I am really excited about this product! I was using too many actives and my skin barrier was destroyed. I did lots of research about how to fix it and many people suggested snail mucin. After simplifying my routine, I apply it to damp skin after cleansing, then the rest of my serums followed by moisturizer and wow.. my skin looks so much better. Redness and bumps are gone, flakiness has disappeared, and my skin feels so soft and smooth. I'll update if that changes, but after 2 weeks I have had no reactions. I use it morning and night and love it! I will say what my dermatologist told me - this is like hyaluronic acid and is best applied to damp skin. If you apply to dry skin, it can have the opposite effect and pull moisture out of your skin, making it dull and flakey and irritated. APPLY TO DAMP SKIN FOR THE BENEFITS.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This product nothing for me. Tried for over two weeks and I didn't notice any difference. What I did notice is a day or two I was running behind and only used face wash my skin had a layer of peeling on it? Flaky translucent all over my face. Even though I had just washed my face.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I'm 30f with 18 years of acne and scarring that I am finally getting under control. I've found a great skincare routine focused on hydration and exfoliation. I switch up my essences a couple of days a week depending on my activity level and sun expose. My high hopes for this were JUST NOT met. In fact, I see the opposite happening of what it's supposed to do. My skin glows without using this, but it will almost instantly dull my skin, and cause my moisturizer to be soaked up like it's in the Mojave Desert. I don't see much a difference or added benefit to my already solid routine after two months of use. It might work for other skin types, but definitely not for me.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I've been having a lot of dry patches on my face lately and this really helped get rid of them. It really locks in the moisture into your skin and just helps it look more healthier!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I've heard so many people rave about this product for months but, I've always been hesitate to try this because my skin is very sensitive to anything new.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,i've heard ENDLESS reviews about this product and i finally decided to purchase bc my skin needs a bit more hydration around this time of the year anyways. purchased it and used it on the same night as recommended and i woke up the next morning with whiteheads on my forehead (i never breakout on my forehead) and some all over my nose! i decided it was just a small reaction to the product and kept using it hoping my skin would adjust to it and to my surprise: it hasn't. it's caused me to breakout in places i never breakout in and it also gave me a small rash on my neck! safe to say i really hoped this product would work for me but it did the complete opposite and i will not be buying again.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Bought this product becuase of Pinterest and it might just be me but sometimes when I later it over other products like The Ordinary's niacinmide it seems to pill,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I really loved this essence, left my skin hydrated after using. I couldn't tell if this product specifically is helping cure my acne scars but I do notice an improvement since using :) but mainly it's really helped with the irritation in my skin from bleach/ water. I work in the service industry so applying the essence to my hands and forearms has helped so much in my routine. So I recommend it a lot it's really nice :)",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I've been trying different skincare products trying to figure out what my skin likes. I have finally found something that works. I actually see a difference in my skin using snail mucin products. I use this essence with a snail mucin moisturizer every night. My skin seems to be smoother and plumper if that makes sense. I have oily skin, but this essence dont seem to be too heavy for my skin. If you use this product by itself it may seem tacky when you apply it. I'll only use this product at night because it does make you look dewy and since I have oily skin, I'm not trying to achieve the dewy look.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Literally my favorite product ever. I have such sensitive skin & rosacea & this has worked the best for me. When I first started getting into skincare I RUINED my skin barrier & I seen so much hype ab this product so I gave it a try & I will be using this forever it honestly helped my skin barrier so much I still needed other hydrating products but this was what I initially used alone & saw so much improvement it's so lightweight & gives me such a nice glow especially when I pair it with the all in one cream. 10/10 if you have sensitive skin or a broken skin barrier & need to hydrate it pair this with your moisturizer & you should be all good,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,My 3rd bottle empty! I recommend putting it on a damp face so your skin can better soak it up. Does not make your face oily too!,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,If I've been rough with my skin or am feeling extra sensitive this has really helped restore my skin barrier rapidly.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,It's sticky and I'm not wearing this under makeup. I guess it's ok but I'm not repurchasing.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Would recommend. I personally would do my skin routine ￼and add this product the step before adding my moisturizer. The snail mucin cream works better. You will have a glow. This alone will leave your skin plump and moisturized. Not a shiny glass finish. Do not! Used too much or it will feel sticky.,1

I don't have that sensitive of skin, and I'm not particularly acne prone but this really broke me out. I didn't have any irritation that would signal an allergy to the snail, so it's not that that's bothering me. I've been using this serum for about 2-3 weeks now and I tried to tough it out to see if my skin was just adjusting but I've had many stubborn and painful blind pimples that take forever to get rid of. I've also got the worst blackheads around my nose that barely budge even with salicylic acid.",2

I was pretty hesitant about this product many times but when I finally caved in and went ahead and purchased this, I immediately fell in love with it.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have very sensitive skin that is easily reactive to a lot of ingredients. I also have eczema, so my skin barrier is weaker than I'd like. This essence works really well on my skin! It has a strange sticky stringy look when you put your hand to it and lift it off, but it's not sticky once on. I had a few tiny whiteheads the first two days of using it but haven't had anymore since. I think this is strengthening my skin barrier because my skin looks thicker and is less easily inflamed. The only thing I wish is that it felt immediately soothing and moisturizing on the face.",5

I've heard of this particular product, seen one of my favorite YouTuber use it and found it at work. I brought the mini and was hooked. The texture of my skin improved so much with just one use. I'm not new to snail mucin at all, a lot of my sheet masks contain it but to use it straight is a whole new experience. It has no weird smell but it is slimy. It gives you glass skin and helps with diminishing dark spots. If you have fine lines and wrinkles, it helps with those as well. I never not buy and use this product. But with any product, make sure to do a spot check for allergic reactions and things. It's not for everyone but if you can use it, I highly recommend it.",1
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"(For reference I have combo + sensitive skin) Seemed to be hydrating at first, but on day 2 of using I had a break out. Like others have said it works for others but not for me.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have sensitive skin. After using this product, my skin became super hot, red, itchy. Immediately washed it off but it almost burned my skin. It took a week to recover from that burnt redness. It looked like sunburn. Not for sensitive skin. May works better on other skin types.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I wanted to love this essence so bad. It has minimal ingredients so you would think this wouldn't irritate the skin in any way, but I was wrong. My face was covered in little red bumps after every time I used this :( my advice were to be careful using this if you have sensitive skin and test it on the skin first",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Was looking for something to combat dryness from a new acne treatment and this is perfect. Absorbs easily, has no fragrance, and restored my moisture barrier. I apply at night under moisturizer and my skin has never felt better.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,My skin is so dry because it's winter in Chicago and this saved it. Honestly I think the price is great. Most serums you get only 1oz and that lasts me a month but this is 3oz and lasts so much longer,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"With oily skin that feels dehydrated from too many exfoliants, I assumed this would boost hydration and it simply doesn't boost hydration as I thought it would.

For this reason I plan on getting the snail cream instead to be used with this essence because on its own it's not very hydrating for dehydrated skin.",5

This is the only toner/ essence that has been able to completely calm my skin from an acute allergic reaction - even my tower 28 spray that I love for day to day skin calming couldn't do the job that this did for me. I only have a sulhwasoo and a Heimish moisturizer that also completely deescalates my reactive episodes like this snail essence has now proven to be able to do every time. (The most comparable texture and result is from the Galactomyces 95 essence, but this is much more viscous and immediately calming whereas that's been ideal for day to day skin maintenance for me). I have dry sensitive and repeatedly inflamed reactive skin that is currently experiencing repeat burning allergic reactions due to a bad reaction to heavy fragrance in a product I used a month ago. Beautiful viscous gel like plush liquid that doesn't have the smell or slime you might be scared of if the snail cream texture didn't work for you. Even with this being the thickest essence I've used, it spreads really easily and as it plushly coats the skin in a lovely thick layer of hydration, it doesn't feel suffocating or slimy at all. This is a perfect product for someone with a highly minimalist routine goal as you definitely can have this be the only step between cleansing and moisturizer and SPF. For the fact this is really easy to use without the trouble of the runny slimy formula of the cream, this is great to use in a pinch (even if it's just until you can get your hands on the new packaging version of the snail cream), so I'm definitely keeping this in hand to save me on travels from more prolonged skin disasters.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This stuff is incredible! My hyperpigmentation is fading and I'm not getting any new blemishes because of how hydrated and calm my skin is now.

I love that it is unscented and has no essential oils and I have never experienced any sensitivity from this, but rather have found that it helps to repair and maintain my skin barrier. I love applying this when my skin is damp as it makes it even easier to massage into my skin, and I normally use one pump, maybe two if I feel like I really need some extra TLC for my skin. Call me crazy but I actually like the texture of the product; it's kind-of a thicker consistency but I have found it to blend into my skin well and have not had issues with it pilling up.

An influencer recommended this as a Holy Grail for multiple reasons or skin concerns, and I was looking for something that checked all those boxes and to add a little needed moisture. Sad to say I tried it, and it broke me out like I haven't broken out in over two years!!! Then I filtered the reviews on the product with negative being at the top and come to find out several others had the same experience. If your not acne prone or concerned about skin texture being an issue or battle for you then this may be for you. I had high hopes but unfortunately this is NOT it for ME.",4

It is a holy grail product for so many people and supposed to be so calming, I didn't realize that this was the cause of my breakouts for weeks (it is the only product I introduced in my routine but I was travelling and thought my breakouts may have come from being on the road at first). Once I stopped using it, the pain subsided and my breakouts started fading. If I could give this essence 0 stars, I would!

I have heard so many great reviews for the is product and how it's helped so many other faces with acne, hyperpigmentation, redness, pretty much everything. So I thought why not switch it up. I've been using this for a month now and I do feel like my skin looks more plump and supple. I won't say that it has made my dark spots go away but I feel like my skin does appear to be brighter and healthier looking. My skin is on the oilier side, So I was a tad nervous since I've seen this is more sticky in consistency. However, this has not made me look any shinier and if anything gives me a healthy glow. I do have some active acne on my cheeks and neck at the moment, so I can't say that this helps to really remedy my breakouts. Overall, I like this product a lot.

I use it typically day and night and I don't think it's transformed my skin- I still have redness and the occasional breakout but I think it's helped with my overall dryness. I know this product has been super hyped on TikTok/insta and I agree but I wouldn't say it's going to change your skin over night.,4.7

I have struggled with sensitive skin and always had problems looking for a product that would not irritate my skin and this is the holy grail . Many people may have experienced irritation or breakout due to not properly using it, I recommend using it on slightly damp skin and also applying a nice moisturizer on top to keep in that moisture. I would not recommend this to really oily folks or people that have lots of active acne because of the moisture but overall great!!!!",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I absolutely love this product. I noticed a bit of brightening over time and it keeps my skin hydrated. recently I started using this on my hair after a shower when it's wet. this has got to be better than any hair oil I've used. my hair looks sooo shiny and healthy! The hyluronic acid keeps my hair hydrated and frizz free while the snail mucin adds shine. I then lock the moisture in with a hair wax. totally recommend!,5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I use this under my face primer and my makeup stays perfect throughout the day. It seems like the tacky texture held my makeup onto my oily face, without feeling greasy. I also put it on at night, let it dry down for 10minutes, then apply Bare Minerals Ageless Phyto-Retinol Face Cream (I also do this on the mornings that I don't wear makeup) I've used other Essence's before and they've made me break out. (I'm 50 and still acne-prone) but this essence doesn't break me out at all. I'll be repurchasing, but it'll be a while, one small pump goes a long way.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This is honestly another amazing snail mucin formula from cosRX and I will be purchasing again BUT it's not for every routine. If you already use their other snail products, it's kind of useless as the other mucin products are already packed with mucin. If you're using the other products it's redundant and I would skip out on this one. I will say though, that through skin changes I've found this is a perfect replacement or alternative to Hyaluronic acid serums. When I first started using this I was already using the snail mucin moisturizer, but I just started transitioning (ftm) and my skin changed from super sensitive and dry to greasy and acne prone but not as sensitive. The snail mucin moisturizer (which I've been swearing by for a year now) just doesn't work for my skin anymore, its sad but it happens when your body changes, not the products fault. So I switched back to an old fave from the ordinary (HA factors) which works for my skin better now than it used to, but I still needed some kind of moisture boost but as the ordinary moisturizer already has hyaluronic acid I didn't want to also use an HA serum as too much HA can cause irritation in the long run. This essence is a perfect substitute for HA serums! I find it even better than HA serums and I've used like 5 different HA serums at this point. So if you need an extra moisture boost in your routine without it being too heavy, have an allergy or sensitivity to HA, or just want to try out snail mucin products, this is a great product! Bottom line: it's not for every routine, but if it makes sense in yours, its great! It does exactly what my snail mucin moisturizer did and gives the same effect! (Glowy skin, longer lasting hydration, minimized fine lines, doesn't clog pores at all). It's basically just a powerful moister boost in your routine, but a really good one. (Product is honestly 5 stars but just because it's not really worth it for most people's routines I took a star off)",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"i've repurchased this and plan to again because no other serums have ever treated my skin so well! i used the ordinary hyaluronic acid for a while which was okay but it never lasted well and left my skin feeling like it needed more, but i never get that with this! i like the texture a lot and it makes my skin feel so smooth and soft, i feel glowing whenever i use this and it's 100% sensitive skin approved",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This hands down saved my life! I have the most complicated skin. First it's dry then it's too oily.. I started using products that broke under my eye on my cheek bones out into red irritation. This product brought me back to life.. I'll forever repurchase.,5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This is well worth the price. I have very sensitive, reactive skin (to sunlight, harsh chemicals, temperature changes, you name it--my skin, like me, is very particular and doesn't like change). This helps keep my skin calm. I think I've repurchased this three times. If I am having issues with my skin because of environmental changes or overdoing it with another skin care product, I pare down what I use, but this always stays in my routine. The slimy texture might get some people, but it kind of fascinating to me. It has no scent I can detect, and I am extremely sensitive to smells. If all I had time for at the end of the day was washing my face and applying two products: they would be the Snail mucin and my moisturizer. It only takes a little so one container lasts a long time.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I was skeptical about something I heard about on social media. But the price and reviews convinced me to try it. I'm so glad I did.

I have very dry skin and am usually looking dry and dull by the end of the day but with this I look fresh and dewy all day.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I was very hesitant about buying this especially for the fact that it's snail mucin. having very dry rosacea skin I have to be careful of what I apply on it.

It looks brighter which is amazing since it's been so dull looking for so long. I have waited at least a month before posting my review because I wouldn't want anybody to put something on the face that would irritate them. but this has made a drastic change on my face and has definitely improved it. if you have dry skin, rosacea, eczema, Etc you really need to give this a try.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,got this because it was raved about but its average. nice but average and honestly it's probably because I don't really need it because I don't have skin concerns.I just enjoy skincare and this just wasn't mind blowing. not hydrating enough and kinda sticky. don't like using it but it's not bad,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"okay so, this has saved my skin so much it isnt funny, it really helped clear my skin and calm down breakouts. its really nice and gentle. i have super dry skin and this has helped much",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I use it before my moisturizer in the morning and evening and my skin looks so good! It's very hydrating and makes my skin look nourished and healthy. A little of it goes a long way.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I was getting the little travel sizes with the sample box which was amazing. It went out of stock for a while so now I just get big size. Love after moisturizer, liquid collagen :)",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Ooooeeee … this has become a holy grail item for me. The snail mucin alongside the sodium hyaluronate works wonders to smooth and protect. But y'all … Y'ALL! You have to use it correctly or it's a dud. I don't understand why more manufacturers of HA-based products (sodium hyaluronate in this case) don't stress that it MUST be layered under something occlusive. And while we're on that topic, if you're using oils either as a cleanser or something you think is moisturizing your skin, if the oil comes before another product, the oil is preventing its benefits from penetrating your skin. Since oils have larger molecules, they sit on top and penetrate less effectively than moisturizers with smaller molecules, like serums and cream-based moisturizers. SO that little lesson is the caveat with this product. Layer it in the right order without any oil in the game beforehand, at least. Rinse any oil residue off your face, then layer it either on clean skin or over a thinner product, like toner and/or a vitamin C active during the day, then put something occlusive over it — a serum or a moisturizer. If you're dead-set on an oil, it must come at the very end of your routine or you're hijacking literally every other item in your arsenal. Back to this product: This order allows the ingredients to do with they're supposed to do, which is pull water to the surface of the skin and keep it there and smooth the skin with the properties of snail mucin. That's the plumping effect. If you don't lock it in, those water-searching molecules in HA (sodium hyaluronate here) are going to go looking for water in the air, which can create a drying effect (known as transepidermal water loss). Is it sticky for a couple beats? Yes. But give it a minute or two and it's dry enough so that your next layer(s) of serum and/or moisturizer won't turn to gravy and will offer a nice canvas for either makeup or pillow time. I use this product during the day and at night. BTW, I have combo skin and I'm 50. Skincare is more than a hobby for me.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I have combo skin and I would break out randomly with huge almost cystic break out that would hurt. I started using this at night and my barrier began to heal and my skin has never been this clear and hydrated. I will never stop using this life saver!!,2

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I really love this product since it keeps my skin smooth and plump. You do need to add a moisturizer after applying since it isn't an occlusive.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I use this twice a day (morning and night) before my moisturizer and toner.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Wow! Honestly this product is absolutely wonderful for hydration. I wear a good amount of makeup so I cleanse really well at night and it leaves my skin feeling soooo dry. This helps SO much, I can really tell a difference in my skin.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I've been using this for a long time now, and I totally love it. I have got to be on at least my fourth bottle by this point, but it's hard to say because it lasts a really long time. I'm mid-30s, fair with dry skin, previously prone to blemishes but not anymore! I've found a great routine for my skin and this snail mucin essence is a staple in that routine. It's hydrating, soothing, and is such great prep for follow on steps. The difference this makes for me is huge. I apply 3 pumps to my hands, then gently press into my whole face and neck including under eye area after cleansing and toning. Follow with serum, facial oil (Loli plum elixir!) and moisturizer. If it's really, really, horribly dry skin time for me, I might replace this essence with my heavy-lifter in the hydration department, my Kitao water essence, which ULTA sadly no longer carries. But I'd say that a good 300+ days out of the year, this is the perfect essence for me. Highly recommend!",2

Does not clear up acne or claim to do that, but has brought down scarring, hyperpigmentation and helped to even skin tone. Highly recommend",2

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I did enjoy it for a short time because it helped with my dry skin but sadly it caused a bad reaction. I would still recommend people try it but start off with a sample size if you can if not try to catch a sale.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I was worried when I originally read the reviews about how it made some people break out but I havent had any issues.

I have fine lines and deep, and I'm only 36, but my skin age is roughly 55. I've tried high-end expensive moisturizers, serums and oils as well as budget-friendly drugstore options and NOTHING WORKED until I found this! I achieved glass skin in one use! It plumped my skin, added an insane amount of hydration and I swear I look like I'm in my twenties now! Just this essence alone replaced most of my serums.

Other essences just felt like something to put on before my serums, no benefits. But with THIS?! I can feel and see the benefits, even after 2 days of using. I bought my mom a bottle too and she fell in love and has recommended it to all her friends (her and her friends are 60+). It obviously won't work amazing for everyone depending on your skin type.

It works alone, under moisturizer, I even mix it with sunscreen in my hand before applying to my face sometimes. I'm 52, everyone forgets that and thinks I'm in my 30's. Not just from this product, obviously, but I use this every single day. As a bonus, this can be used as a micro current serum with my NuFace Trinity device! I have sensitive skin, so every other option for the NuFace (except their expensive one) irritates me. Aloe turns my skin bright red! This snail serum is my skin's best friend.",4.7

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Only have been using it for a couple of days but can tell a difference. Reminds me of my Drunk Elephant Glycolic night serum for a lot less of the price.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"i live in a very humid climate and THIS!!! super hydrating on my skin. i started using it after i broke out using a different product and idk what it did, but all i know is that this gave my face another chance. i started seeing a lot of improvements on my skin; my skin looked more plumped and glowy, healed my skin barrier, and hydrates my oily face without making me look more oily. ugh i just love this product please love yourself and get this. i got one for my mom (she has dry skin) and it's awesome. i feel like this could work on any skin types.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I bought this product during the 21 Days of Beauty event. I have very acne prone skin, and I was a little nervous by some of the reviews, but I'd used snail mucin before and hadn't noticed any major breakouts, so I proceeded with usage. After a few days, I broke out in small hives + acne all over my face and neck. After halting use, they began to go away. I'm not sure if my face is particularly sensitive or if the product reacted with my normal skincare routine, but either way my test patch on my arm didn't react this way. My mother tried the product and it works great for her skin. A couple of the reviews have said that if you're allergic to dust then don't go for this product, but I'd say if you have seasonal allergies than don't go for it either, or if you do, just be careful. I don't think this is any fault of the product, as people have had wonderful experiences with the product, but it definitely didn't work for me.",5

I heard about how snail mucin was like the secret to having youthful healthy skin and let me tell you I'm a believer. During Covid I only used this and a moisturizer after washing my face and it was like all I needed. It was like a vitamin c serum mixed with a toner and all of that good stuff into one. I have oily skin and a lot of people complain about how sticky it is but honestly I don't think it's that sticky. When I first started using it, yeah it was different and it was a slimy sticky texture but after patting it into my skin it drys up nicely. After using it consistently I got used to it and the results were stunning. But for sure seal it in with a moisturizer.",1

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have tried SO many products over the years to help soothe my very sensitive, red, combination skin. I am prone to acne when my skin barrier is compromised! I have experimented with different active ingredients the past year and my skin has become very sensitive and sometimes nothing can soothe the redness and irritation. Like not even vanicream or the most simple ingredient products. I struggle with my skin barrier and constantly am in ""repair"" mode. This essence was a GAME CHANGER for me. It did not irritate my skin, cause any redness, and no breakouts!! It's so rare for me to find a product like this! I apply it after washing my face and prior to any other serums and moisturizer. I have consistently seen a big difference in my skin since using this. It is more hydrated, soft, less irritated, less red, and just looks beautiful and clear. Absolutely worth every penny and you get a large amount for the price! A little goes a long way. I am literally so happy I found this product. Highly recommend for those with skin like mine!!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I bought this spontaneously before a long winter trip and doubted it would last me for the three months I needed. A little goes such (!!) a long way and this tiny bottle would last a couple months of continuous use! I have very dry skin so I apply the essence before a heavy moisturizer and it feels like my face just took a big glass of water. Plus there's less fine lines on my face that are caused by dehydration.,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Great product. I use it every day,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I use this AM and PM because it provides that extra hydration I need to make my skin supple and glowy. Continue using this daily for amazing results to make your skin look and feel healthier!,2

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Love this stuff, it's so hydrating, feels sticky at first but soaks right into skin. I use it before a HA and let it soak into my skin before moisturizer. 10/10 and great ingredient list!",5

It also gradually lightens my acne scars and my overall skin seems brighter the next day.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I use this gem of a product in between my toner and moisturizer. Sometimes I'll think to myself that it doesn't do much...and I'll skip this step, but I think that it does is it adds that moisture barrier that our skin needs. I can't think too much about the snail aspect of it, cause then it freaks me out -- but I love this product through and through.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,My skin has never felt so smooth and looked so plumped. Absolutely amazing.,1
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"When I first used it, the texture was a bit shocking but once I got used to the feel of the lotion I love it. It really makes me feel like my skin is soft and glowing.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Fix your skin barrier. I saw that as a daily deal and bought TWO. First couple days of using it my skin was THRIVING! It was moisturized and MY OILY. My skin felt dewy and my 31-year-old face was giving LIFEEEE. TOO BAD, the dewiness later led to OIL. My skin was shiny and greasy. I did switch to a new face wash so maybe that's the culprit? I am not sure, but I stopped using it twice a day and skipped it altogether this morning. I hope I didn't waste my money or maybe this is just for use during the cold months? Not sure, but oily skin isn't my thing.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,i have been using this day and night for at least 3 months and i swear my skin has never been better - i have sensitive skin that breaks out anytime i add anything new to my routine and this has not irritated it one bit!,2

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have bought this essence now 2 times, and for me it is well worth the price. The essence is moisturizing and it gives a long lasting glow. For me, I like to mix it with another essence to help decrease the time it takes to dry down. If you like having a glow, check out this essence, if possible try to get a sample of this.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Noticed immediate results with skin smoothing and less inflamed skin!!!,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I bought it after reading all the reviews raving about the product, if you have sensitive skin stay away from this product",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This product has helped my skin so much in the little time that I have been using it along with the cream. At first I was scared because many products don't work well with my skin but this one helped me so much. Some things don't work for everyone , but if you desire more moisture along with a lightweight feeling this product is perfect. If you have oily skin this product is a good moisturizer that won't make your skin feel heavy. It made my skin soft and even. The smell isn't noticeable to me and the consistency is perfect. This might not work for everyone but it works for me",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I tried it for two weeks and caused a ton of whiteheads. I found it a waste of money.,5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Love this product. I let this sit for 30 secs and apply a heavy moisturizer to lock everything in. So good!,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Okay so I tried the mini version of this and my skin looked amazing and so hydrated at first. But then I started developing tiny little white bumps on my chin. So I read other people's reviews and apparently some people had the same problem. I'm like 99% sure it was this product (there is a chance it could be something else though.) I have oily/combination/acne prone skin and I needed a good moisturizer because my skin was getting dry from retinol and this definitely helped that. I just wish it didn't give me these little bumps!!! They don't hurt and they're not super noticeable but they bother me.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Everyone's skin is DIFFERENT so definitely try it out atleast! I bought this on a whim and have been loving it! I have sensitive acne prone skin and this did not break me out:) I love how hydrated it makes my skin and my akin has never been better. Highly recommend,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I really wanted to love this since I had heard such great things about this product and I just blind bought it really. If feels amazing on the skin and left my skin feeling super velvety and moisturized BUT a day later I had hives all over my face. I thought it was a one off experience and really wanted to give this product the benefit of the doubt and used it a second day and the rash/ hives persisted. Within 24 hours of returning it my skin calmed down to how it was before. Very sad about this because the feeling was amazing but not worth the hives (personally).,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I bought this elsewhere and was so excited to try it because of my aging dry skin, I'm not really sensitive to much but this .. YES .. i have allergies to dust , dander and a few other things so like another Reviewer said — Do your research.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I never tried snail mucin before, but heard about the potential benefits it has for skin. I started with trying the snail mucin face cream and absolutely love it, so I thought I'd give this a go. I thought it was a face spray when I ordered it, so I was disappointed at first when I got it and realized it wasn't. BUT boy, am I glad I discovered this! My skin is improved a ton, smoother, softer, hydrated and my chin acne has cleared. I love these products!",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"this is beyond the best essence i have ever tried. i have combination, acne prone and sensitive skin. after only 3 days of using it my textured skin was softer, smoother and more radiant. it cleared up my acne and helps with hydration. a pro tip is to use before applying makeup because it has an amazing grip that helps your face makeup last all day long!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I got this and the all in one cream in the travel size as a gift, and I love them! I don't use it everyday, I just use it maybe a few times a week (usually before bed) and I wake up with an amazing glow! My skin is very normal and does not break out easily (knock on wood).. so I love the glow it gives me. The lotion does seem a bit dry on my skin at times, so I'll usually just top with another face lotion and I haven't had an issue with it. This product is sticky when you apply and when it dries, but moisturizing afterwards will help! 10/10 recommend!",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Caused tiny bumps and itchy skin. When you have a massive variety of products that are more sustainable, cruelty free and allergen free why even bother using this? Learned my mistake the hard way.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I received the moisturizer to sample as complimentary, but I bought this essence after using the moisturizer. The 2 products together are amazing. I've read if you have an allergy to dust, it could break you out in hives so please do your research and sample it before using it on your face but these products have left my face GLOWING! My face has never looked more healthier and has never been softer! These products are new staples in my skin care routine! Next I want to try the eye serum! I can't wait!",5

I'll still give snail mu",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I use this every day and night paired with the corsx cleanser. This stuff makes my skin retain my moisture so much better!

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I hand the intention of buying this when it restocked because of the rave reviews. So, I patch tested it in store and within 2 minutes my entire hand was covered in painful hives! Not itching but actual pain. This was very strange to me because I have never had a reaction to any skincare product like that, let alone on my hand. PLEASE do your research and patch test before purchasing this! I heard if you have a dust allergy, this can cause a lot of issues.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"So many reviews have said that the product is sticky and takes 20+ minutes to sink in. Having used snail mucin before, I know this to be true and was looking for a more affordable snail mucin than what I had previously. It's typically great for dry/dehydrated skin and despite being acne prone, snail mucin actually brightens my face. HOWEVER, I don't think I got an authentic product, because this not only hasn't done anything for my skin in over a month but the texture is so watery and evaporates SO fast (in seconds). I arranged to have this curbside pick-up from Ulta, so I didn't realize that the outer box was smashed until I got home. Thinking it was unusual, I overlooked it and started using the essence since the bottle was full. I should have made the return! Now I'm stuck with a product that was probably half used, topped up with water, then returned. If the essence isn't tacky and visibly sticky/stretchy, it's probably not authentic so be warned!",2

I noticed after a few days of using it, i was getting tiny bumps under my skin on my forehead. After doing more research I found out if you have a dust allergy snail mucin can cause you to break out into itchy bumps. I stopped using the product and the bumps were gone after a few days. I wanted to love but it just didn't work with my skin :(",1

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I was so excited to try this product because of all of the positive things I have heard, but honestly wasn't that impressed. I feel like this did nothing to benefit my skin, wasn't moisturizing, and the texture was not great. This product was so sticky and took forever to absorb into the skin. I would rather save my money and use The Ordinary's Hyaluronic Acid serum instead (and actually see results).",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Use this after using Jordan Harper's Barefaced Glow Peel Pads and my skin has never been smoother or glowier. I've never written a review but if you are thinking about this, definitely go with it!",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I absolutely LOVE this product! After two weeks of regular use (both AM and PM), I've seen a moderate reduction in fine lines around my eyes and mouth, and a DRASTIC reduction in my facial redness. Now that my complexion is smooth, even and no longer blotchy, I've tossed out my medium coverage foundation and started using a tinted moisturizer instead. After I'm finished cleansing, I'll apply toner, then immediately follow up with snail mucin while my skin is still damp, to lock in the residual moisture. Fair warning though; this product is extremely viscous, and it does feel a little like applying snot to your face... but I promise, the results are worth it. It's difficult to find a skincare product that's effective, reasonably priced and lives up to it's hype online, but this one undoubtedly does all 3 of those things. Highly recommend.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"The people that are saying this is awful probably aren't using it correctly, or could simply be that it isn't for your skin. You need to throughly wash your face, gently pay face BUT KEEP IT VERY DAMP STILL!!! And then while it is damp use maybe 3-4 pumps and spread it on your face. After spreading it all over face, push it into your skin by gently pressing your face everywhere until it is almost dry. Then I wait 5 mins to put a good amount of moisturizer on and after a few weeks the results are amazing. I have dehydrated, acne prone, oily skin and it helped so much repairing my skin barrier.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I broke out into a huge rash all over my face and it is taking forever to heal! Worst purchase ever this deserves 0 stars.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I had very high expectations prior to purchasing this and all of my expectations were met. What stood out to me when I first put on this product was that instead of irritating my skin and redness occurring, the product soothed my skin. I have very sensitive skin so this is always an issue. I apply this product on my skin while damp. I definitely recommend doing this as it helps the skin absorb the product better. I have just begun to get into Korean skin care and this was my first Korean product. I am so impressed and excited to try more products from this specific brand.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"i was scared to use this at first because of course after i bought it already it started showing up on my social media saying it caused people to break out and i am breakout prone. but i decided to just try it anyways because i can't go based off what others say. and my goodness i am so glad i tried this!! it actually helped get rid of my breakouts, it keeps my dry winter skin smooth and hydrated, it has actually helped do wonders for my dark spots after having acne. my skin has actually never looked better. this product was an excellent addition to my routine and i'll never stop recommending it to people! give it a try.",1
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,It has really revitalizes my face after years of drying it out to get rid of acne. I also have sensitive skin and it didn't make me breakout. My skin looks the best it ever has!,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"LOVE this product!!!! A lot of people are complaining about acne…push through! It made me break out for a period of time as well, but I kept using it and it stopped. Now it just gives me a healthy glow and helps keep my skin clear! It helps with fine lines and hydration and also has a cooling effect after washing your face! Love it!",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I'm normally a ""keep it simple"" with only my cetaphil wash and vanicream, but I decided to try this after seeing a tik tok (easily influenced lol) and I now love it! It just adds to the hydration of your skin and if I have any type of bump on my skin it's gone the next morning",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I love this stuff!! I bought it for layering and extra hydration. My skin is super dry and I needed an extra oomph of moisture. I use this 2x a day and it's the first layer I put on. I use a lot because I love how easily it absorbs and it helps soak in the rest of my products I put on. Usually I use an oil and a facial moisturizer on top! I never notice any pilling. Definitely recommend to my dry humans out there!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I've been using this product for about 2 months, I wanted to try it out for its anti aging benefits / helping repair skin barriers. Horrible idea. I've never had an issue with acne and since I started using this I broke out everywhere. I looked like I should belong in high school. I had major pizza face and a huge rash across my cheeks. Absolutely awful product. It's been a week since I finally decided to throw in the towel and admit that snail mucin is never going to work for my skin. I'm still covered in a rash and acne everywhere. I probably wouldn't recommend.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Could be cheaper,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This helps my dry skin so much. I use it with my retinol at nighttime and it makes my skin so much softer. I love it,1
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Everyone raves about this product but all it did was give me really bad acne :/ I'm sure it has to do with the dust allergy that is connected to snails! Really hydrating, just not for my sensitive skin!",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have acne prone/combo/sensitive skin and the serum was not moisturizing for me, it just kind of sat like a film and made me break out. It sucks bc everybody recommends snail mucin, aloe, and rose hip for oily/acne prone skin but those products only make me break out",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I was looking into products that would help my damaged skin barrier and this was highly recommended from people of all skin types and concerns. I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this stuff has been helping with my skin . I've noticed a difference since day one and continue to have major improvements. This product works best on freshly washed damp-wet skin tap the product in do not rub it . Do not apply on dry skin and also apply a moisturizer right after.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"To all the people saying this made their skin feel tight and the pilling bothered them, yes the product does pill when you add a moisturizer on top of it but once you rub the product into your skin it goes right away. Don't use this as the last step in your skincare otherwise yes your skin will feel a little tight but in the morning and with continued use, you're skin will look so dewy and moisturized",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I was conflicted after reading the reviews. So many reviews said great things and a few said they broke out etc.. I have acne prone skin so I was a bit scared at first. But i decided to just try it anyways since i'm not planning on leaving my house for a few days. and I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. first, it actually helped clear my current breakout within 3 days of usage, second my skin feels so much more hydrated I noticed a change in hydration within the first day of using it, even when i wash my face and have nothing on yet my skin just feels amazing. This product is amazing. I haven't noticed my acne scar dark spots fading yet i've only been using this for 2 weeks. but i'm hoping it does start to help fade them.",1

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I am not exaggerating when I say this product changed my life. After stopping topical steroid use I triggered either a bout of rosacea or perioral dermatitis that traveled all across my face. Before this product I was using a prescription topical treatment that dried my skin out. My face was red, scaly and painful. I purchased this product after seeing it talked about on tiktok. My acne prone skin is so sensitive that I can't easily introduce anything into my routine without causing cystic acne breakouts or redness. But this product absolutely changed and rescued my skin. I apply it two times a day, the best is after a shower while your skin is still wet and before your moisturizer. The snail mucin has relieved redness, helped heal my cystic acne break out, decreased my rosacea, hydrated my skin (during winter in a dry climate) and didn't break me out at all. I have struggled with sensitive dry skin my entire life and this product has been an absolute game changer. And I've tried a lot of skincare products geared towards rescuing dry skin and this product will be my go to for the rest of my life. I would add since snail mucin naturally contains contains hyaluronic acid this performs much better with a moisturizer on top to ensure water is being brought to the skin instead of moisture being pulled out of the skin.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"My skin type: combination oily, acne-prone (genetics) and sensitive. I use Curology so I have to be careful what I add into my routine. This however, has helped huge acne of mine heal up QUICKLY and help with scarring. If u already have perfect skin, skip this, u don't need it. If u have acne in general no matter the skin type (oily, combo, dry, normal) add this to ur routine as a spot treatment or to put on larger areas of ur skin that has multiple discoloration/ acne scars :) I hope this helps",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I bought this knowing nothing about it. I saw a tiktok nighttime skincare routine using ""essence,"" remembered something about mucin being good, and randomly picked this one. I was unsure about it after reading the reviews that this was drying. My skin is sensitive and easily angered. My skin was feeling tight after cleansing and needed moisturizer immediately to soothe it and hold off the visible dry patches. So anyway, I added this in my nighttime skincare routine. I use cerave cleanser, apply this, apply the laneige water sleeping mask, then lock it all in with cerave healing ointment. I noticed the difference immediately the morning after! Normally my skin feels dry after washing. Not anymore! I feel like my skin barrier is finally restored. My skin looks plump, and my finer lines are fading. I use it every other night, on alternate nights I apply retinol in its place.",1
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I purchased this earlier last year yes a year ago and does what it's supposed to do I'm in my wonder years and this essence is absolute best for a woman with mature skin The lines are less especially around the mouth around the eyes look better as well you gotta ask your self what do you Want this Essence to do for your skin all products aren't for everyone that's why the market is saturated with so many saying Theirs is the best I was looking for a clean product The ingredient list is not a long one which means less other stuff in almost 2year of using this product it's great yes it does have a tackiness just don't use to much..It's a great purchase for the price,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I wanted to love this stuff but it wasn't for me. First , I knew it was the mucus from a snail but the texture made me want to gag.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"this product is not it. first of all, it made my skin really tight after i applied it. and second of all, it pills very easily. as soon as i put it on my skin, it flakes off. waste of money",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have noticed a difference in just a few days in regards to appearance. My skin is glowing & my acne scars already look less noticeable. I'm truly blown away because I have oily, acne-prone, sensitive skin and I was worried this wouldn't work for me based off other reviews… however, I'm obsessed and this has become a nightly staple in my routine. It's a bit sticky upon application but if you rub it in enough, I feel no residue on my skin. I also like that it doesn't have any scent to it. The best part to me is that it's already helping to lighten acne scars that I've not been able to get rid of the past few months.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,So many people rave about this essence and I was so disappointed to find out it doesn't agree with my skin. It made my skin appear less hydrated? And it also caused weird texture. I really wanted to love this product.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Really glad I got the travel size bc I've heard from all my oily skin and acne prone gals that this is THE serum, but sadly it made me break out and would leave a strange film on my skin, which in turn made it feel like the product was on TOP of my skin, and not penetrating in at all. Squeaky tight feeling instead of soft and supple. I tried it over the course of a few weeks.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I've been using this product for about 6 months now and honestly, this is the type of product I don't ever see myself being without ever again. I have VERY dry skin and I've always had a problem with redness, especially around my nose/mouth. Literally the day after using this, my skin was SO plump and it seriously looked like I had gotten some work done! My forehead especially looked super smooth. My forehead lines that are normally super prominent looked like they had vanished overnight by 70 percent. Using this religiously has truly made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin. My redness has significantly calmed down and any time I get a bad breakout or inflammation, this helps heal it. In most cases, it even makes any scarring go away in a matter of days. After using it for about 6 months, I still have a little under half the bottle left and I use it pretty liberally every day. I've found that it's best to pat it into the skin. The consistency is a bit sticky/gooey and the smell is a bit odd but it's really not that bad. It might seem weird to some because of the content of the product but if you can get over that, you should really try it out!",4.7

I hope I continue to like it after the 28 day test",2

I've only been using it for 3.5 days (I use it twice a day) and it has completely changed the texture and glow of my skin.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I initially tried this when it first released and it wasn't super popular in the US yet. I saw it's potential from the beginning but took a break after I ran out because I love trying new products so I went a few years without buying it again. I bought it earlier this year again and now that I ran out again, I've realized how amazing this essence is! It adds great hydration to the skin, feels nourished and the best part of me is that it heals your skin very fast. I have hormonal acne so there's always something popping up and now that I don't have it, I see how much longer my acne takes to go away so obviously I had to order another one. Snail muccin has shown healing properties but Cosrx doesn't market it probably because of the lack of robust research. But I promise you will notice a difference when you use this for a long time. And it last so long too!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I kept hearing about the benefits of snail products for a while but never bought anything to try for myself. I can confirm there is something in it after using this. I opted for the snail muci power essence after finding it in a Youtube tutorial and then researching it. Slimy is the first word I'll use with this one, texture-wise I don't think I've used something quite like it before! The fluid is very lightweight and melts into the skin quickly. It has a pleasant orangy scent and spreads smoothly around the skin. I feel moisturized after wearing this and fresh! I feel that it helps with dry skin and even adds a little glow to my cheeks and forehead area? Must be down to that shiny 96% snail secretion power! I only use around two pumps and that is enough for my entire face and neck - so a little goes a long way which is great. I feel like my skin is replenished after using this, and I sometimes apply a thin layer before bed like a sleeping mask, to work its magic through the night.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This product has worked wonders in just a few days. I'm only in my late 20s but I have a few fine lines on my forehead, presumably from stress/payback from unhealthy habits in my early 20s. I've tried so many hydrating products, expensive moisturizers, changing my diet, chugging water all day every day, but no luck. This was exactly the product I needed to finally draw moisture into my skin. I've been applying morning and night right after cleansing and my fine lines have diminished so quickly in just barely a week. I never write reviews for products but my skin looks just as plump and hydrated as it did at 16! The consistency is pretty slimy at first, but dries down really well and is not sticky at all.

I have used it in combination with other products or by itself, but I can always tell the next day when I have skipped it. It makes my skin so soft and calm the next morning. My redness/discoloration is less apparent, the texture feels smoother, and my skin feels more plump and hydrated. Every night or every other night I pair this with a Paula's Choice exfoliant - usually the 2% BHA liquid exfoliant and the two products work so well together at keeping my skin calm and smooth.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I saw this product on TikTok so I thought I'd try it out. While it was extremely hydrating I started to notice little white under-the-skin bumps appearing on one cheek, so I stopped using it and the bumps have since not disappeared.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I bought this because I didn't want to commit to a larger size if I didn't like it. Even so, it's lasted for a long while (a little goes a long way). I have dry, eczema prone skin, so I look for strong moisturizing products. This is it. It leaves my skin feeling SO PLUMP every time, and I can definitely notice the difference when I don't use it. In my normal routine, I use it after toner. The consistency is as you'd expect, so only use a little because it can get sticky and hard to absorb otherwise. Then once you've patted it into your skin, it's ready for your moisturizer! Love this, will definitely buy again.",4
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I use this right when I get done cleansing and when my face is still a little damp, this product has amplified my other skincare items' effectiveness by 3000% and made my moisturizer work much much better. I've even used this product when my face became inflamed/irritated and it soothed and calmed it down right away. A 10/10 in my books.",3
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Broke my skin out for months after using half the bottle i had to throw it away if you have sensitive skin dont use it just get vitamin c to clear up scarring cause it only cleared up my rosacea a little bit,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Wow!! I've never used a product that made me glow as much as this! 5/5,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,lasts forever and feels so good,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I don't find the consistency sticky or gross - it's very comparable to a HA that I use. I've been using the product for almost two weeks - haven't noticed much of a difference in my skin other than it feeling softer. I have noticed black heads appearing more on my nose - but that could just be my skin getting used to the product (as it tends to do). Will give it more time :),4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,used for seven months just to find out this was the product that ruined my skin. Once i stopped using it my skin cleared up. Maybe i Was allergic to an ingredient ???,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I love this bottle for spending the night somewhere where I don't have my normal elf essence! My serums soak in wonderfully after applying this, definitely take this for travel",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,i use this 2x a day after cleansing on damp skin and lock it in with my moisturizer,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,work good for me and i really bought this one because i wanted to buy it instead of buying the bigger version. this small one is going to last u a while because u don't need a lot to cover ur whole face,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have been battling red/flaky/bumpy skin on my cheeks for the past few years..I haven't been diagnosed but, always thought it was possibly rosacea...only after about a week of using this just in the morning my skin has transformed! The bumps and redness are gone..really amazing!",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This is an excellent product. This product feels very high end but is super affordable. The texture does take getting used to and it is my least favorite part about the product just because it takes a tiny bit more patience since it has a slimy texture. This does NOT gross me out or anything- I simply don't like it because it takes a little longer to work with. But I know this is just the nature of the filtrate and not the brand's fault, so I didn't deduct a star in the rating. This product feels like a slimy version of The Ordinary's Buffet serum if you've ever tried that. Equally hydrating; just a little thicker and slimier. Sometimes I like to mix a 50/50 puddle of Buffet and this essence and apply both. Such a bomb combo and makes the Snail essence a little easier to apply. I always apply either this combo or just the essence onto damp skin like you always should with hydrating serums.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"The texture took me awhile to get used to. It does feel slimy when you apply it, but once it has soaked into the skin the sliminess disappears and the skin just feels plump, hydrated and a little dewy. Honestly I'm not the biggest fan of the texture, but the results are worth it.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I bought this because of the popularity, but this breaks me out super bad. I also didn't see any more hydration in my skin. I've seen reviews saying it may have a new formula than previously, and I can believe that.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I saw a instagram video of someone who had a pore moisture barrier with there skin and they said this product helped them. Over the last couple years I kept having random break outs and it turns out that can happen when you have a weak moisture barrier. Using this stuff I noticed a change immediately and my skin has cleared up! I love it,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This has replaced my toner stage. It's the base I put down before all my actives, and I simply adore this product. Sometimes I will go a few days without it and my skin can tell. I loves this stuff.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"snail mucin is my hero ingredient. this essence softens my skin and has noticeably faded my acne scars! the texture takes a bit of getting used to, but when you get over it, you can really appreciate its benefits.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This is so good omg. I love it so much super hydrating !,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I love this product! It helps reduce my redness and hydrates my dry skin without feeling heavy. It's also helped to even out my skin tone and texture, especially acne scarring. Would recommend for any skin type",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I usually apply this after a certain moisturizer just because my skin is irritated by the smallest gentle breeze but this stuff keeps my skin supple and glowy. It feels a little slimy, obviously, but I love the way it makes my skin feel and it layers great with the other products I use after this. Seriously y'all, worth the buy.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have sensitive acne prone skin and this product didn't have me breaking out, it's very gentle with an water like base that also feels like a gel.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"If you're looking to achieve glass skin, this is one of the products I recommend. I have a 20 step skin care routine of South Korean products, including this one, and I have seen results in less than a week.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"It feels really nice and honestly I was so excited to try it. I love skincare because I rarely wear makeup so nice skin a must for me! But this caused break outs that looked like tiny hard bumps! And I NEVER get those! Stopped using it and they disappeared. Very disappointed, not going to lie :(",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have relatively normal peri menopausal skin with break outs. This didn't absorb and left a film on my skin. After a few days, I also experienced small whiteheads so this was a no go for me. I'll use it up on my legs but won't repurchase. I know it's touted as an HG for many but the multiple times I've tried it through the years as my skin changed have not been a good match for me.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,Amazing with a micellar water before using!,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This product is responsibly priced and most definitely worth a try. I have rosacea & need a good hydrating serum. I'm currently obsessed with it & happy I looked into this product specifically😁😁 my skin is so soft,4.7

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I wouldn't want to be without it.. but I couldn't tell you why? Am I just addicted to it? I'm not sure. I just feel like I need it- but it doesn't do all the work you need an occlusive on top. Then again for the price I guess it's understandable that it won't fix all your problems- it's a reasonable cost for a very good product. I'm excited to try their honey propolis products too. Seems to be a decent company.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I have super sensitive and dry skin. I was hesitant to try a new product since it is so easy to set off a break out. Ever since starting to apply night & morning I wake up with smooth feeling skin and the breakouts I did have have healed so quickly. Definitely recommend.,2

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"For anyone with acne prone skin, this is not for you.",1
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,had this product for a while in my routine and it gives such good moisture to the skin. it is a bit sticky at first but it doesn't dry down sticky. would recommend to someone who has dry skin.,4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,It's got a pretty simple ingedient list and it feels super yummy on my skin. It feels like I'm applying fat water to it. I really do think it's helped with moisture retention and I would totally suggest this as an extra hydrating step.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I haven't seen any difference. May have too many chemicals as my skin is slightly sensitive to it.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This is the first essence I've ever used. I'm 19, almost 20, and I just moved to Arizona from South Carolina and my skin has not taken it well moving from a super humid climate to a super dry climate. This, and the snail cream, have really helped my skin become moisturized and plump again. All I need is one pump for my whole face. It soaks in great and is light enough for my oily areas (T-zone). I'm absolutely in love with it. This is now my go-to essence.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I love this essence, my skin feels so soft and I can definitely tell my cheeks aren't dry as that's usually a big concern for me (combination skin here hello). My routine is simple cleaner cerave foaming cleanser, this essence vani cream and sunscreen during the day, at night it's cleanser then essence followed by azelaic acid from the ordinary then moisturizer and I'm done. I noticed keeping my routine simple helps not overwhelm your skin.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I bought this a few weeks ago and have used it every morning and every night. My skin is so much softer. It has this healthy glow. I have noticed that if I use this after exfoliating, I have zero irritation at all. I will absolutely repurchase. This will not replace your moisturizer but it makes it more effective. Since using this, my skin doesn't feel dry when I wake up in the morning. The texture takes a little getting used to, it is well...slimy. But honestly it's not as bad as you might imagine and you get over it quick.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have very dry, sensitive, and severe eczema prone skin. This has been such a life changer and has helped fade a lot of the hyperpigmentation on my face. My face is so smooth now and you NEED THIS!!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,My skin has so much hyperpigmentation. Since I started using this toner twice a day my skin has shown tremendous progress. It hasn't been even 4 weeks since I started using this. It's a magic in a bottle.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I thought this product would be slimy but was very surprised. I have noticed a difference within the first week.,4
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Works like a charm! I have been having a really hard because of my hyperpigmentation after breakout spent hundreds of dollars to find a right product for me but this was it!

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Ive been using this for about a year. The texture through me off for a bit but I use it when I do my facial massages. So far I havent really seen any changes, even after a year but I enjoy using it. With that being said I doubt that I will buy again.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,In places I don't usually breakout. Little whiteheads. It's bad,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I use this with my serums and moisturizers to help them sink into my skin better and it has upped my skincare game to the next level. It stretches my other products and has never broken me out in the slightest! My sensitive skin just loves it!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Let me first say I love this product! It is super hydrating and super refreshing. My skin is sensitive to many common skincare ingredients so it's always hard finding products that won't irritate me but still work. Usually when I do theyre super expensive. This was a random pick after some research because it was relatively inexpensive. I think the consistency will initially throw you because it is pretty slimy when you first put it in your hands. But I think if you can get past that, I guarantee it doesn't disappointment. I find it's all about how you apply it. If you're unsure get the travel size (what I did). A little goes a long way with this stuff so you get a good trial. My skin really has never felt softer and I have pretty soft skin to begin with. Totally worth it!!",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I've been using this product nearly consistently since I was 25. It always had the most nourishing, light and clean slightly sticky moisturizing feel, but not oily. I was concerned when they changed the packaging that they may have changed the formula order, and it appears they did. It's not the same at all, it (so far) hasn't broken me out ((it's been a week)....but it feels more gummy, thicker, not as easy to spread, immediately when I put it on it doesn't have the same skin quenching feeling it feels like a gummy barrier and the ingredients feel obsolete and impotent. I'm probably going to have to ditch and replace it...sucks this was my saving grace. Biggest differences noted: the old formula used to literally MAGICALLY make my skin supple slightly dewy hydrated and my pores would nearly disappear! This was seriously a magic potion and it cost so little. Now, feels like trash my skin kinda itches a bit, pores are gross and feel full of gummy stuff and it has a filmy feeling on my face. Maybe I got a bad batch, but the ingredients apparently got shifted in their order with less emphases on the actual active ones. Bummer.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I love this essence! Super hydrating and love how dewy and fresh it makes my skin look. I primarily use this for my day time routine when I am not using any actives or serums (wash, tone, essence, and moisturizer). I like to follow this up with the cosrx advanced 96 snail mucin cream on days when I am makeup free because the glow is UNREAL!",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Husband and I both have soft, bright, pretty skin now. It helped a lot with my redness. Thank you, snails.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This product is so moisturizing yet still lightweight! I use it at the beginning of my skincare routine before applying anything else and it instantly hydrates my skin. Love it!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I started using this serum a few weeks ago and am obsessed! I have very dry, sensitive skin. (I literally could moisturize three times a day and my skin would still be dry) but after adding this into my routine, I've found that it locks in moisture so well and my skin is moisturized, smooth, and plump all day. First I double cleanse, use my other essences/serums, then apply this masterpiece. Would absolutely recommend!",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"Currently on my second bottle and will keep repurchasing. After a few days of use, I was loving how my skin looked and felt. This product is lightweight, moisturizing, and helps reduce the redness from acne. When first applied it is slightly slimy and sticky since it is snail mucin but that dries down within a couple minutes. I use it morning and night after cleansing and have no issue layering products on top of it.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"A lot of people seem turned off by the idea of using snail secretion, but the proof is in the pudding. I have dry skin, and this is my go-to when I need extra hydration. It doesn't feel sticky or tacky and applies beautifully. Don't know if it necessarily helps with fine lines, but it definitely plumps and gives a ""glass skin"" effect.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,This is the best essence I ever used. So hydrating yet super light. My skin is the softest and brightest it's ever been,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I would return this but I've waited too long. I'll probably use this on my hands or legs because it's fine product. However, my skin can be a bit reactive and this indeed breaks me out. To be sure it was this product, I used it. Broke out. Stopped using it and my skin cleared up. Used it two days and then had FIVE blemishes. However, the texture is lovely and melts into skin. For the right skin type this would be wonderful. got it on a Beaty steal so only about $10 lost on this one. No smell which is nice and dries quickly",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I've been using this for over a year and loved it cause it kept my dry skin HYDRATED (i even put my friends and they loved it too). The problem is that now my face (and my friends' faces) are breaking out like crazy! Nothing new has been added to my skincare routine besides the new bottle which I purchased last month. Please change it back to the old formula! i love this essence a lot because it's the only one that does the job but now it's not it. ._.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This is another K beauty product I saw great reviews on, and wasn't disappointed. I use the peach and lilly glass serum and love that. This is slightly different, although it still makes your complexion look great. It is slightly sticky, I've found if my face is a little dampened it goes on so much smoother. It makes my pores smaller and my face look more even toned. I know it's supposed to be great for acne prone and oily skin. I can't attest to those. For my dry/normal and sometimes sensitive skin it works well. I notice my pores are smaller and my skin looks smooth with a nice glow. I purchased the travel/sample size to try it, but I will buy the larger one next time. It doesn't take a lot to get good coverage(especially if your face is damp), so it should last awhile.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"i love this essence, i use it morning and night and am on maybe my third bottle. i have very dry skin so i use it as the first of several hydrating steps but for more normal skin it'd be nice alone as a light moisturizer. i don't think it's sticky when used in a thin layer. so fresh, so clean!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I love this versatile product-- there's a reason why it's viral and so well loved. I use this brightening, moisture barrier building serum in so many ways! To boost lightweight moisturizers, to help dilute certain stronger serums, and I even pile it on and use it as a sleep mask.. This overtime has helped completely plump out my forehead which used to have deep, deep horizontal lines even when I rested my face. My makeup used to crease and cake up and now it's totally plumped out. I have to squeeeeze my forehead to even get it to look how it used to.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I can definitely notice the difference in my skin.

This product should definitely become a staple in everyone's routine.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I am such a skincare fanatic and love trying out new products when others run out.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. Not sure if I notice any difference yet but I will continue using it. It is a little slimy but not bad at all. Once you have it on your face it is absorbed pretty well. My skin is soft and I haven't had any reactions to it. Will see how it works after 1month.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,works amazing. it doesnt make me break out. it keeps my skin soft hydrated and refreshed looking all day. defiantly worth the price.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I was surprised I started to see results in 1 day. I cleanse, tone, and then add this product before moisturizer. Softer skin with decreased furrows and lines. It is almost like maple syrup in that it can have ropes when you apply it but tapping it into the skin and it absorbs in. It also does not cause breakouts or rashes on sensitive combination skin. My friend from Singapore had been using similar products for years and had amazing skin. Wish I had started using it sooner!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I have dry and very sensitive skin and am allergic to most skincare products (cerave cleansers, ANYTHING with fragrance) and this product has been a lifesaver for my skin. I live in a very dry climate and putting this on before moisturizer has helped my skin so much, my redness has gone down, my texture has improved and my skin doesn't feel tight and dry throughout the day. This is such a calming and soothing product and I think it could be beneficial to all skin types",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"This product gave me acne and made my face peel for days. I discontinued the product right away. Cleared up my skin and tried it again and it gave me the exact same result, acne and peeled my skin. It also takes forever to absorb into the skin even when using a light amount. I would not buy this product again.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I use this before moisturizer and after my serum and my skin drinks this up like water. It definitely is more supple, even and healthier looking after I use this product. The moisture it gives is great. It's especially nice for oily and combination skin, due to the gel-like texture and how it sinks into the skin. I use 2-3 pumps for my whole face and it works perfect.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I find this makes a great dupe for the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair serum for a fraction of the cost. This product is tacky but, for the love of Pete, dampen your fingers with water when you apply! That is a must do! Otherwise you will not like it and the negative reviews probably didn't know to do that.. This product locks in moisture (use it before your moisturizer) and sinks into your skin so nicely doing all of its magical stuff.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I've been using this for about 8 months (and I'm only ~halfway through the bottle) and I love this stuff. I don't find it to work any miracles for things like acne or redness but I definitely don't notice more acne or redness which is great for sensitive skin like mine. This works wonders for dryness though. Makes your skin look very healthy and a bit shiny at first.,5

I have very dry skin (especially in winter) but have noticed that my skin still feels like it has an abundance of moisture locked in by the evening! I expect this bottle to last for many months at the rate I am using it. Note: snail mucin has properties of... snail excretion. If you pump a drop onto your finger, the product will ""string"" out as you lift the bottle away. I feel like this attribute may turn some people off so keep that in mind.",4.7
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"A little of this product goes a long way! Use one to two pumps of this after your toner! It melts into the skin & gives the best glow!

It moisturizes my skin like no other and helped me to combat my dark spots!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I really love this product. I bought it on a total whim because it was promoted as good for soothing dry sensitive and had a 3x's point bonus. I read the reviews and they seemed legitimate. My skin ever since I turned 31 has become quite dry and sensitive but I also have the occasional breakout. I use about a pump and a half of this after cleansing. In the morning it's vitamin c serum and sunscreen and at night it's a heavy moisturizer.,2

I had been looking for an essence product that was great for sensitive skin. I saw reviews about this product and I immediately picked it up. No burning, no redness, just soothing and healing support to my paired down skin care routine. I've been using this for almost 2 months now and the psoriasis and any other irritation is GONE. I use it daily in the AM right after cleansing on damp skin. Will definitely recommend and repurchase!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,I really love this product. I've used it for about over a week and I definitely noticed my skin feeling softer and being an oily skin person this is perfect.

Definitely buying again.,2

I have been using this product daily at night for about 2-3 weeks or so and I have seen a great improvement in my skin.

I am curious to see what it will do for my skin during Texas summers.",4.7

It's only been a few days using this but OMG!!!! This stuff is to live for!! I'm serious it really has made such a difference in my skin & my rosacea in a few short days! When you put it on it's nothing special & you don't really feel anything unique about it...So that may disappoint you at first but once you keep using it & see the results you will be blown away! I have basically only been using in the morning but I have used it at night a couple of times. My face looks so much better, younger, smoother & less red with no makeup on! I hope they never change the formula & that this will continue to work wonders on my face as time goes by. I would definitely purchase again hopefully on sale!!",2

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I'm in my early 40s and have always been mistaken for early 30s until 2020 happened... stress its effects on my already maturing skin (and hormones) caused my skin to rapidly change from combination to DESERT DRY. Crazy fine lines and flakiness by the end of the day just made my make up look god-awful by the end of the workday, and no creams or serums seemed to work. I started using high-concentrate ceramides, and it sloooowly made some change in hydration, but still looked aged and dry. I ordered the Cosrx essence and lightly patted a couple pumps of the liquid... looks sticky and like clear snot when you have the flu... once you get passed that moment, you can appreciate how moist and soft your skin immediately feels. I let it dry a bit and added another layer. I then added a layer of the Cosrx All In One on top and went to bed. The next morning, my skin looked Pretty. IT FELT SO SOFT and looked healthy. I applied my usual makeup and watched it throughout the day, and while it started becoming dry, it never got to the flakey cracked appearance I've been dealing with for months. I bought a humidifier for my home to keep my skin hydrated and will continue using. So far, a couple days in, it still feels good. I hope this continues to improve.. worth a try to anyone dealing with similar issues.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,$25.00,"I noticed a mild burning sensation with this product. In days I used it I also noticed that my eyes felt dry and irritated. I don't have sensitive skin but sometimes I experience burning with products that contain Phenoxyethanol. I don't experience it with every product that it's in which is good because it's in almost everything. However, when I feel a mild burning after applying a product, it always has Phenoxyethanol in it. This essence doesn't have many ingredients and one of them is that preservative so maybe that's why. It's a bummer because usually Korean skincare is pretty clean and they often come up with creative ways to preserve their products such as zanthoxylum-piperitum fruit extract. ( a Japanese pepper that acts as a preservative). I sucked it up and used this essence for about a month. I think it helped keep my skin moisturized but other than that I didn't notice any or the other results that snail mucin products boast.",2

I was using another brand night cream, but that started clogging my pores. I bought ELF Holy Hydration moisturizer and my skin felt better. I saw this on sale and I was like, this probably would help. Omg. I put this on first, let it dry, then the elf cream. This + the elf has left my skin feeling smoother than ever before. Even when I wash my face in the shower my skin feels like pillows. I *think* this product enhances the ingredients of other products. Before I put this on, I use The Ordinary Niacinamide and ABA serums. I had been using both of these serums for like 8 months, with no noticeable difference in my dark spots. As soon as I added this Snail Cream in my routine, in a month the dark spots have reduced quicker than they had the whole 8 months before. So, yeah, I'm never going back!

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"The title says it all...I heard amazing things about this cream, and since I was a few months into using AlphaRet and my skin felt acclimated, I decided to incorporate a new product into my routine to give my skin some TLC. Yeahhh...this made me break out into the itchiest rash and made my skin red and sensitive :( I can imagine it's amazing for some but it just really wrecked my skin (which is bizarre because I have used snail mucin before with no problems). Definitely patch test",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I was very surprised by the texture of this cream. It is very soft and has a luxurious feel. Its my first time trying a product from this brand. I am using it after the Dermalogica ultra calming trio kit because I believe my skin barrier needs repairing. I opted for this cream instead because they didnt have the one I wanted in Dermalogica, and I can not say that I all disappointed. (Though I havent tried the other one I was originally after, so I cant compare) I will say that after a week of use on my sensitive skin, I havent had any issues with breakouts or rash like other reviews mention. I notice that my face isnt producing as much oil during the day either when I use this. I do not know if it will have a permanent place in my routine but I would definitely recommend and might buy again :)",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This moisturizer is perfect for oily skin. I would say that it's a little too lightweight for my combonation skin personally. I have to mix it with the essence to get through the product. Definetly not for you if you want your glow to last, I get that initially but eventually my skin gets matte for the most part. But the formula and benefits are great, it really does heal the skin and diminishes the dark marks.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Did not read prior to buying that if you have dust mite allergies, you are prone to break out using this product. It caused me to develop terroble acne. After a week, I still havent been able to get these pimples to clear up",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Im in my mid 30's and this product has become a staple in my routine. Its not meant to be a moisturizer but is amazing to add to your skincare steps. I see people complain about that. This is not meant to be a one step cream. I use this cream as a step 3 in my routine morning and night.,4.6

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This is my first review ever, and regrettably, I'm bummed to write it. I have been using several of the CosRX products and they have meshed well with my skin; that is until using this moisturizer. It does take some time for my skin to generally adjust, but I found that my face got even drier and reactive to this moisturizer over the span of 2.5/3 weeks of use. By the end of my usage, it was making my skin sting upon application. If you have sensitive or acne-prone skin, please heed caution when using this moisturizer.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I've been using this product for a long time now, and the snail mucin line for years. The thing people always miss when they start using these products is that you should not be slapping them on dry skin and expecting them to absorb! Your skin should be slightly damp, like after you wash and lightly towel dry or immediately after applying a toner. Then you apply and pat in. Never had a problem and I reach for this on days when I know I need a lighter moisturizer instead of my usual under sunscreen.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I broke out in tiny whiteheads and my face felt rough for like 2-3 days,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"It floats on my skin and cannot be absorbed. It creates a layer and is easy to be washed off, so at first I liked it in summer because it kept my skin clean and not greasy (also I was using it with a dermalogica gel). But it does nothing to moisturize my skin and even dries it out. After using it alone for a few days in November, my skin has rash and is very sensitive and itchy.",4
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Tried it, wanted to love it, but my skin hates it. The 1st day using it everything was fine, next day I broke out with a mild looking, painful rash down the middle of my neck and on my cheeks, it almost looks like a sunburn if you didnt know I tried a new product. It also dried my skin out like crazy to the point if flaking in some spots.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,At first when i tried it my skin was so dry the next day and had a reaction but now when i apply it i dampen my face with a toner and omg its amazing leaves my skin super glowy only bad thing that its not moisturizing enough so i go in with a heavy cream after i would buy again😊,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I brought this hoping itll truly moisture my skin as it has the snail mucin in it that I normally love. But unfortunately, it did not. I found myself having to apply quite a bit to get some type of moisture on my skin which felt nice. After a little though my skin felt dry again. Not really a big fan. Would stick to the birch sap moisturizer from COSRX instead.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Very disappointed. Product is thin like watered down lotion. It dries down immediately and I have noticed no moisturizing properties. In fact, I think it has dried out my skin!",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"if youre like me and never used anything with snail mucin before, youll be shocked when it comes out of the bottle. it is a bit slimey but just trust me, its great. its very light and soaked in nicely while still giving me a natural glassy finish. some say it doesnt work under makeup but I only use it in my nighttime routine. it doesnt feel like something that would work with a makeup routine honestly.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Me and my boyfriend both tried this out from seeing it on tiktok and we both got pimples on our faces that we usually never get so we stopped and the pimples went away. It was really moisturizing wish it actually worked for us. 😓,5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This stuff is my holy grail! Every time I run out of this stuff and leave it out of my routine I notice huge differences in my skin. Firstly, it makes my skin super soft, if someone touches my face they always mention how soft it is. It also helps amazingly with acne, I dont know why it just does! Helps with the inflamation for sure. And a little goes a long way, I just take a small dab and its enough for my whole face and neck. Def get this, you won't regret it.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I love this all in 1 cream! Its a little pricey but its worth it in my opinion. It last a while too! It sits sk nicley on the skin, very glowy, glads like skin. I have been using this product for at least 6-7 months and i havent been disappointed. Only a few times i broke my skin barrier and my face was very dry and peeling it didnt keep my skin very moisturized, other than that its been great! I use a little more at night than during the day and i wake up and my skin is amazing.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I've been seeing how popular COSRX is and decided to give it a shot. I was recently using the ordinary moisturizer and was about done with the tube and decided to upgrade my moisturizer. Best decision I've made. The all in one cream has been very skin friendly to me, all I need is just a pea size amount and it did the job. Very creamy formula; pairs nicely with my serums and sunscreen.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This is such a good step after a serum and before sunscreen! On its own it isn't enough for my combo skin, it's a hydrating water based gel cream so someone really dry needs something more occlusive and rich for sure.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I was excited to try out this moisturizer as I've heard a lot of good things about it! But unfortunately, it wasn't rich enough for me, my skin would feel dry by mid day. I think someone with normal to oily skin would enjoy it more. The texture is light and slightly tacky. It didn't irritate my skin or make my acne worse.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This product is great if you have combination, oily, or normal skin. There are way better options out there if you have dry skin. I also really do not recommend this for anyone with cystic acne. I have combination skin and I love this! Its very lightweight and absorbs very well. I've been using it consistently for over a month and I love the way my skin feels and looks after using in conjunction with the essence. It has a very nice glow without looking or feeling sticky like a few other gel moisturizers I've tried.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"The ""all-in-one"" label made me hope I could streamline my nighttime skincare routine on nights my fatigue is really bad. Not the case.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Great product for people with oily to normal. It's very lightweight and gel texture. It is not hydrating enough for my dry skin though.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Bought one a few months ago in the jar, and much prefer the new tube packaging.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,My skin is always dry and I love how hydrating this is without feeling too thick.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Really hoped to love it because of all the reviews I have seen and I was so exited to use it and it made me break out the day after I used it and I hardly ever breakout and it was one of the worst breakouts I have ever had.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I got this on sale they had. I was curious because i wanted to use something soothing, hydrating with my trentinoin. At first use over night my skin felt soooo dry and made my lips dry too. BUT i just needed to READ the proper instructions how to use snail mucin! Use it over damp skin always. I spray my skin Wet and immediately use it over my skin. And oh my goodness my skin is plump, dewy without being greasy! Over the past weeks the fine hydration lines on my face are smoothed out. It pairs so well with my full strength trentinoin, i haven't had irritation. I think people are either using wrong, aren't exfoliating their 2-3 times a week. And are just allergic to snail mucin. When used correctly it is so amazing with amazing benefits!",1
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I accidentally purchased this instead of the Snail Mucin essence, but it was a happy accident. I have been using it for almost two weeks & my skin is softer, smoother, and looks brighter. Added bonus is how little product is needed to cover the face and neck.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I got the cream because the store i went to was out of the essence. This product is amazing. I cant compare it to the enssence, but im sure its just as good. All the reviews are correct! First use i feel a difference! I have been using it only at night. The main reason im writing this review is because it has helped with my chapped lipsXD Which is a thing i did not expect. I bite my lips constantly, which makes me want to bit my lips more. Its a never ending cycle. Im not applying this on my lips! Just from it being on my face, its moisturized my lips! I wake up to my lips being completely smooth. Not all scratchy.",5

It was good but I didnt want to repurchase something that expensive. I found this and decided to give it a try. I WILL NEVER GO BACK! I love this! My face always feels so smooth, its glowy and looks so much healthier! Mixed with my other products, I rarely break out anymore! The best part is, I don't have to break the bank! I love this stuff! 10/10",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I've been using this for about a month on and off. I wasn't really keeping track of its progress and actually thought it wasn't doing anything. But after a while, I noticed my face looked a bit fresher and prettier when I would walk past the mirror. Still I didn't think much of it and didn't correlate it to this product. Fast forward, we go out to eat and I took some selfies. I was quite surprised that my skin looked nice in the photos - no filter was used! I had makeup on, but still my skin never looked very nice with how I put makeup. I finally thought, huh I think that snail cream is working. My boyfriend has also noticed and is now using it on himself. He says he sees the difference and that it works to make the face look smoother and softer. It did not remove my age/brown spots, but definitely made my complexion prettier.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I have dehydrated sensitive skin. I purchased this in conjunction with the advanced snail mucin cleanser and the Full Fit Propolis Light Ampoule serum. 30 days later and there has been no change in the fine lines, uneven skin tone, dehydrated look in my skin.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I've only been using this for 2 weeks. I can see my brown spots getting lighter. it does do well under your makeup. I usually brush my teeth or wait for 30 seconds first. I don't have to use full coverage concealer or foundation. instead of applying a dew look with makeup it comes from within! I follow the steps for my combo to dry skin and have a lot of redness on my cheeks. its calming and feels smooth also. By the way I'm 61 and have always used high dollar skin care since I could afford it on my own. But I have to say I love Cosrx. as far as a slimy feeling, I didn't notice a thing other that it goes a long way. no scent what so ever. This is cheaper than what I was using, I have to admit I love getting all my free gifts with other skincare. But for now I'm going to finish Cosrx and update you at a later date.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I came in looking for sometbing to help with my dry skin and redness and this has actuallt helped so much. I love to pair this with the intensice hyaluronic cream for added hydration and plumping,4

Just after a couple days of using I have noticed my skin looks more plump and hydrated even some of my acne scarring has reduced in appearance. I use this after my serums + suspensions and layer on my moisturizer after. I think people might think to use this to replace a moisturizer but this definitely needs another layer of moisturizer on top to really lock the hydration in. I will be buying again!,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I've have been jumping from moisturizer to moisturizer since they've all had been giving me rashes, then i found out abt this snail mucin moisturizer, at first i was a little spectacle abt it since everybody had different opinions on it. Around that time i was suffering with a chemical burn from my last moisturizer and hyperpigmentation, at first when i started using this moisturizer i didn't see much progress the first two weeks, but after some time my hyperpigmentation had gotten alot better and the chemical burn had gone away completely and healed it had also helped with my acne and fungal acne. Although its very messy it's still so worth it!! It leaves my face hydrated and sooo glowy! And will definitely repurchase, and for anybody with sensitive skin!

I used it for five days, and it dried out my skin so bad that it started flaking. I tried using it on both dry and damp skin, since snail mucin is a humectant, and I had the same outcome with both. I returned it after day 5. I know this product has worked wonders for a lot of people, but I guess it wasn't meant for me. I still use and love the essence, though.

I continued using the product for another month to see if my skin was just purging but the breakouts have continued and are constant. I love the texture of the product, but it doesnt seem to be helping my skin or my breakouts.",1

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Ive had this moisturizer since February (today is July 20th) The jar looks almost full still! You wouldn't believe that i use it every single morning. Only moisturizer ive found that doesn't break me out or worsen any acne i have. Definitely worth the price.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,it is so so moisturizing but make sure to use a generous amount or you won't see any results. after I started using it I no longer had sebum in my nose. I tried switching to the peach slices one but it just didn't work for me AT ALL. 10/10,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I've tried the Peach Slices snail mucin toner, but I like this Cosrx product more!

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Feels good at first but it literally dries out my skin so badly. Not even a minute after I apply it my skin gets so dry and dehydrated if anything. Its kind of bizarre considering the good reviews it gets. Someone here mentioned they felt their skin tighten, and I agree. Even after I applied my makeup, my face felt tight and looked drier than usual. It also kind of smells like pen ink/ants to me. I tried the jar version too and its the same ordeal so its not even a matter of the bottle having a different formula. Peacchslicess has waaaay better snail gel.",4.6

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"oh my goodness! I have psoriasis and about 2 years ago I had a cancer scare. the stress of that caused a flare up on my face. I tried so many things in my price range to treat it, but nothing helped. it just got worse and worse until I couldn't even wear foundation anymore because it would stick to the patch between my eyes and made it look like my skin was literally peeling. it was so embarrassing. I read a review from someone else who got this for her bf who also had psoriasis and it helped so I jumped and bought the whole line and I'm so glad I did! between using this daily and using a chemical peel once a week, it's actually gone away to the point I can actually wear foundation again! as long as I keep up on it. if I go too long without, the patch gets worse. I have even recommended it to my sister who's psoriasis is even worse qnd it's been helping her too! I haven't noticed a scent. a very little goes a long way. I get just the smallest amount (like barely dipping the pad of my index finger in it) and it covers half of my face. it feels hydrated after and not stiff. unless I use too much. it IS slimey, so be forewarned. snails are also related to mollusks, so if you're allergic, don't use this. I am, but was desperate lol turns out I can't ingest them, but topically I'm okay.",4.6

It takes a while to absorb but it's no problem for me. For sure I am gonna order it again.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I bought this because I loved and still use the Snail Mucin Power Essence, but the moisturizer just isn't as good. It goes on and feels really moisturizing, but it absorbs so quickly and ends up feeling like I've applied nothing at all. It may depend on your skin type, I have oily skin on my t-zone but normal everywhere else. If someone asked whether or not they'd buy this product, I'd say it's okay but you can probably find something better at the same or a lower price point.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"started my skincare journey more seriously last year. I rarely EVER repurchase an item, if i run out of a moisturizer or toner, im likely to run out and try another. Not this one though. I'm obsessed. Here's what i've observed in my skin since using: - moisturization and a serious glow - smooth appearance when wearing makeup (doesn't pill under other products) - glass skin - minimized fine lines (i was freaking out about my fine lines, between this nightly and a retinol every 3 or 4 nights they are almost gone!!!) - minimzed irritation My skin loves this. The texture is funky, but once you get over it, you will be putting full globs of this on your face and the results are addicting. I have a dry to combo skin type and this is the best moisurizer i have ever tried. Will forever repurchase.",2

I originally applied it to dry skin but then saw others recommended to apply it to damp/wet skin so I gave it a try in hopes it would be better. Unfortunately it wasnt. I made sure to use the whole thing, more so for my own 'experiment' if you will, so that I could truly give it a try. I will say, even though it didnt do my skin well over time, in the beginning id use it under makeup and it looked really good!",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,As with the other products everyone seems to be using it. This is worth all the hype. Its not heavy on the skin and a little goes a long way.

It also made my skin feel dry and tight as if I didnt put on any moisturizer….I have heard many postive reviews of this product and I really wanted to like it.

Although it's really stringy and a little difficult to handle coming out of the jar, I didn't mind this so much. The worst thing about this is every time I use it my skin feels tight and dehydrated within half an hour. I'm a healthcare worker who works Night Shift so my skin already feels unreasonably dry under my mask. By the end of shift, my skin is flaking like a sunburn and my undereyes look dehydrated. My previous moisturizer never left my skin flaking like this. The only thing I can think of that I may be doing wrong is not using other products in this line, but I feel I shouldn't have to.

After about an hour my skin felt dry. Not supple at all. I'm in the process of finding a new daytime moisturizer because this ain't it.,4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I though I loved it at first because it made my skin glassy and dewy; but I noticed after a while that every time I used it would get tiny random bumps and pimples on my face especially my jaw and forehead.,5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I bought this after hearing rave reviews on social media. Like a lot of other reviewers, I wanted to love this but it didn't work for me. It is very light weight and glowy on the skin, but I feel like my skin absorbed it like a sponge and not in a good way. Although it's really stringy and a little difficult to handle coming out of the jar, I didn't mind this so much. The worst thing about this is every time I use it my skin feels tight and dehydrated within half an hour. I'm a healthcare worker who works Night Shift so my skin already feels unreasonably dry under my mask. By the end of shift, my skin is flaking like a sunburn and my undereyes look dehydrated. My previous moisturizer never left my skin flaking like this. The only thing I can think of that I may be doing wrong is not using other products in this line, but I feel I shouldn't have to. The fact it's in a jar rather than a pump also bothers me, because I feel I can't even give this away to a friend in good conscience.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I was looking for a hydrating moisturizer, and came across this one and decided to give it a try.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Like the other one-star reviews, this dried my skin out like nothing else. It also gave me a lot of painful little bumps that had little in common with acne (I have acne, I know what it feels like, this wasn't it). I couldn't tell you what I had an allergic reaction to, but if you have sensitive or highly reactive skin I'd steer clear of this product.",5

I put it on before bed, and woke up to glowing, soft skin with my acne scarring looking significantly better than it had just 12 hours before. After a few weeks now of using it morning and night, I can confidently say I will never use another moisturizer. I never thought that glass skin was possible for me, and this product has given that to me! I get compliments on my skin all the time now, I've even started using it on my inner thighs after shaving. I normally get insanely bad razor burn there and break out in hives if I try to use any sort of lotion. I haven't had a single bit of irritation or redness now! I also have no issues using it under makeup. I allow it to absorb into my skin for 5-10 minutes before applying sunscreen and my foundation/base makeup sits perfectly on it all day. I will shout from the roof tops about this cream for the rest of my life. I have always been insecure about my skin, and now I could cry at how amazing it looks!!",5

I'm slowly trying to incorporate more Asian beauty products in my routine since I have Asian skin. The only caveat is that I also religiously use my Curology prescription which has a retinol. This product definitely didn't moisturize my face enough on my retinol nights. It dried out my nose and cheek area so badly that my skin would peel throughout the day.

I've used it both AM and PM, but if you're like me and like to put a pretty big glob of moisturizer on when you moisturize, this one does take a minute to sink in, so I prefer to wear it at night. On the mornings I do wear it, I have to make sure I don't throw it on and run out the door, I have to remind myself it needs a few minutes so my mask doesn't get wet either. Overall, I still love this product and it's really my tried and true. It never clogged my acne prone skin and I always wake up feeling like I have soft skin because of it!

No matter what I've tried, everything made it worse. I even had to give up my holy grail products. So I finally gave in and gave this a try and I absolutely love it! I won't lie, it is… different, especially from the typical moisturizer. The consistency is super weird, but if you can look past that I don't think you'll be disappointed. After a week my skin is no where near as oily and looks so much more radiant. I will say, I do not think this product is a good fit for someone with dry skin. I think this is better suited for oily skin, as it does have a tightening effect that may not be what someone with dry skin is looking for.

I have dry skin and have issues with it feeling tight and well this didn't help relieve it at all. Wasn't moisturizing enough for me. Felt good at first but my skin felt a little tight after a while and I didn't like that.,1
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I got this in replacement for the essence and I honestly like it more! The texture will take some getting used to and although it super moisturizing at first once it dries I always put another moisturizer on top.,4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I had damaged my skin barrier with some retinoids and picked this up to try and get some moisture back and repair my skin. It has been extremely helpful and I credit it for not only helping my skin barrier but also my foundations have been applying so much smoother. I use the essence during the day and this at night. Neither have a smell. Both are thick but spread easily and feel great on the skin. Highly recommend.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I have dry skin and it made it worse. My skin felt tight and even started peeling after I put it on.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I'm enjoying my Advanced Snail 92 by Cosrx. I just wish I could have got the serum on the 50 % off But the store was out.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,It keeps my face hydrated. By far one of the best moistened.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,It doesn't give me enough moisture I like to layer it with a water based moisture to give me that juicy glowy skin! But it works good,4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Not all alcohols are bad. Take it from an Esthetician 🤚🏽 hi! This one is a fatty alcohol so it's quite moisturizing 👍🏽 I love this cream. I prefer the essence only because it has a pump.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I've gone through a few of these and love it! I was surprised at some of things negative reviews but I think I've figured it out. I've always used this as a nighttime moisturizer and top it off with an oil or some healing ointment, and I never found it to be drying at all. After looking at the ingredients, this product is high in humectants but low in occlusives. Humectants retain water, and occlusives seal it in to prevent evaporation. So it worked well for me because I was adding that extra occlusive layer on top, which is a good idea at nighttime in dry climates regardless of the product you're using. Also, I saw some comments about cetearyl alcohol- cetearyl alcohol is very different from normal alcohol and it's nit drying at all, which is why it's allowed in products labeled ""alcohol-free"". Hope this helps",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I have dry flakey skin around my mouth, chin, nose, and eyes. It gets really bad in colder weather and I've tried so many products to help and they work for a few hours then I notice the flaking happening again. I've used 2 full containers of this because it's that good. I'm on my third repurchase because this is the only product I've found that has combated the flaking and dry skin in those areas. Each time I run out or my skin looks better I push it to the side and within a few days my skin is like ummmm we are missing some and starts flaking again. My go too product for sure.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I was unsure of this product because of its consistency, but I'm so glad I didn't let that stop me from trying it out.

I have 4 sisters and 4 daughters and this will be a new staple in all our skin care! It's that's good, I have to spread the good news!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I actually purchased this years ago and I wasn't a fan of it at first because it has a slightly tacky texture due to the snail mucin. I never threw it out because I'm a college student and don't want to waste the money I worked hard to earn. About 2-2.5 years later, my skin barrier broke due to excessive use of retinoids. I couldn't get my skin to heal no matter what I tried. I found my old container of this cream and decided to just give it a shot. It worked! After weeks with a broken skin barrier, this cream completely healed my skin in just a few uses! Definitely one of my all-time favorite creams now. Even my dad likes it. He has dry skin and he says the snail mucin gives him such a nice glow and makes him feel young again.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I have combination, acne prone skin and I love this moisturizer!! My skin always looks so smooth and I hardly breakout when I use it. The only downside is is can be drying on the dry parts of my skin.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I use to use biopelle moisturizer with snail secretions. It works amazing but it will break the bank at about 80-100 jar. I use this but only at night to refresh and rehydrate. Helps prevent and may even get rid of smaller fine lines. It has helped with mine. I would not recommend to wear for day use or under makeup. I don't think it was intended for that anyway. For reference I am in my 43 I have combination skin. But I've always maintained a good skin care routine. Key is prevention. This doesn't well for that. Make sure hands are clean before applying so you aren't introducing bacteria into the jar. I have tried the essence and I do not like it. It makes me break out with acne. If you have sensitive skin I would recommend this over the essence. The essence makes me break out. It's more like a serum.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,My akin is sensitive and the combination type. This made my very skin dry. I also developed little bumps on my face. The essence worked perfect with my skin so this was a waste of money to try,5

I wanted something more moisturizing and tried all the hyaluronic acid creams and niacinamide you name it nothing helped. Then I bought the cosrx eye cream and it was so smooth and hydrating I caved and bought this too. It's been AMAZING. My face feels like a new born babies butt lol smooth AF. So soft and stays hydrated all day. A little goes a long way and I haven't even touched my Rosehip seed oil since I bought this.,4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I put this over my thicker moisturizer. I get a small amount and put it on my acne prone skin and sensitive skin.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,The perfect moisturizer & the only one that's ever made such a noticeable difference with my skin!!

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I use this after I wash my face underneath a thicker moisturizer to lock in moisture. The water at my house was really drying me out and causing my skin to be very red and break out BAD. I picked this moisturizer up along with the Cerave moisturizer and I have been using the two together, morning and night. My skin cleared up almost immediately and is softer than ever!! I will be using this combo forever",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Was so excited to try after reading the description that said the formula had no alcohol but after reading the ingredients, there is Cetearyl Alcohol in it :( Sensitive skin beware!!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"So this was the online item I changed in my everyday makeup routine.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I have very dry skin especially in the winter time. I try high end products and low end, but rarely find anything that quenches my Skin. I thought this product was decent prize for jar you get. Yes, it does feel slimy and takes a minute to get use to. But once I apply it to my face, it drank it up. My skin is glowing and no more dry patches. It has held up so far with a cold December. I rarely repurchase a product and I am about to buy my third jar!! You won't regret this if you have dry skin. My makeup also applies well with this.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I have super dry and sensitive skin. I have been using HA after washing my face for the past few years and made the switch to this product a few weeks ago. My skin feels amazing.

And I found that this cream isn't nearly as hydrating as the Cosrx Hyaluronic Intensive Cream. It feels really nice going on, but my skin starts getting thirsty within the hour. Might work for oilier skin types or those in more humid areas, though.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"i had a problem with dry skin for the first time in my life this winter and i have no idea why. it's not like the humidity is any different, i haven't changed anything etc. anyways, nothing was working. i tried facial oils, hyaluronic acid, anything and i was still so dry. every time i put on makeup it was caking up and it was terrible which i've never dealt with before. i bought this from ulta after seeing it on tiktok (lol), went home, washed my face, used this and woke up the next morning with literally a 90% improvement of how my skin was before. this is the ONLY thing i put on my face before makeup and my makeup went on PERFECTLY for the first time in literally a month of dry skin. just buy it",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"leaves my face feeling dry & tight. maybe it would be okay if you used it like a serum under a moisturizer but this is supposed to be an ""All in One Cream"" so??? Definitely not worth the money. i find more value in the jar it comes in than I do the cream",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,It made my skin so so dry. Would not recommend this to anyone. After looking at the reviews I got excited but my skin is now super dry and flaky and red from this product. I have sensitive skin and this exasterbated it.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,My skin loves this product very much. I'm Normally dry and this is a gel product yet my skin stays hydrated all night until morning. I love it and this is my second time purchasing the product.,4.6

My forehead,cheeks, and chin all broke out in acne. I was so sad I had to go get a script from a DR to clear it all back up. Returned",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"My skin LOVES this stuff. It's especially great for helping my skin recover when it's irritated, breaking out, etc. I've been alternating between this product and the snail 3ssence depending on the season. In the winter, I layer this under a night cream. In the summer, I use the essence instead. I've also successfully used this as a standalone moisturizer in the summer and really enjoyed it!",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I love the snail essence soo much ! so I wanted to try this cream hoping it would be just as amazing as the essence but I've been using it for a couple of days now and it's soo drying even after putting another layer of a thicker moisturizer, my skin felt dry and really tight :/",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Do NOT recommend. This moisturizer was promising when I first opened it because it seemed very moisturizing. Within an hour of using it my skin was already dry and flaky. After a few days of using this product I got Contact Dermatitis. My face became covered in small bumps and scaly patches and became itchy. Nothing in my routine changed besides using this product and it started to get better a few days after I stopped using it.,5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,It's funny how people say this makes their skin drier or tight! Same with hylaronic acid. As a moistirizer alone yes that would happen. You are suppose to have a damp face while applying most hylaronic acid products.Helps with sticky tacky sensation as well. However most importantly... make sure you add a thicker moisturizer/occlusive over the top to keep it all in..hylaronic acid pulls moisture I'm and will suck it up from your face without being sealed in.. Noww try it.. you will be happy.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I use a ""sandwich"" method for retinoids (light moisturizer --> retinoid --> heavy moisturizer), and this snail cream has been great in the first moisturizer step!❤️ This lasts a long time, and it feels fantastic going on.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I love the water gel creams but my skin is starting to need more moisture as I enter my late 20s. I bought this after James Welsh on YouTube was talking about it and I'm glad I did! He warned that you don't need to use very much and that is the key to loving this product! Maybe like a pea sized amount - especially if you're using other serums underneath. My makeup sits fine over it when I use the right amount but if I use too much it does get goopy,1

I had to return it.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"As someone with sensitive combination skin, this is the only moisturizer that moisturizes my skin without making my T-zone oily or making me break out.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"After lots of positive recommendations, I purchased this last week and started using it 4 days ago. After just a few minutes, it leaves my skin at least as dehydrated as it was before I applied it. I think the hyaluronic acid in it is the culprit. (Dirty little secret: hyaluronic acid is actually a dehydrator if you live in a drier climate.) I have to apply more moisturizer over it to keep from feeling dry. Plus, even when I do that, it leaves my under-eye are looking crepe-y and wrinkly. This stuff is also slimy and messy. Trying to get a dollop out of the jar leaves, well, s snail trail over the rim and onto the counter. I had high hopes and I'm tossing this almost full jar out.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Absolutely love this cream. I used retinoids that dry out my skin and with one use I could see a huge difference in my skin's appearance. My skin was very soft the next day.,4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I can't rave about this product enough, it far surpasses any moisturizers I've used in the past. I live in Florida, so lotion type moisturizers often feel too thick and make my T zone look super oily throughout the day. I loveee how lightweight this moisturizer feels and it keeps my skin soft and glowy without looking oily. Also, I have veryyyyy sensitive skin so the simple ingredients are perfect for me because I never have to worry about them making me break out! My Only complaint is that the consistency does make it a little messy to put on, so I'd love if they came out with this moisturizer in some kind of tube that makes it easier to dispense the product. Otherwise, I can't recommend it enough!!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Love this as my night cream. Use it with the snail mucin vest combo ever,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This moisturizer is great! I love the silky feel and just feels like a veil over the skin. I will add if you have extremely dry skin I will say you might find this not being enough. I'm more dry normally and sometimes I find myself having to put more on. (Which is ok) overall it's an amazing product, I'm an esthetician and actually recommend this to my clients. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it is very messy when you first open it. the product is very ""slimy"" hence the snail, just be careful when using it the first couple times because you will get it over your contour or hands. Overall great product, will continue to recommend and use personally.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Super hydrating! I wake up and my face physically looks more plump….and it lasts all day… (I have normal with an oily t-zone) I noticed that it reduced some redness from acne I've picked at, too. I read somewhere that it has a small amount of naturally occurring chemical exfoliant found in snail mucin. Emphasis on gentle, so you're not going to get noticeable exfoliating effects from this over night. It's very hydrating but if you live in a climate where the air is low humidity, you might want to top it with more of an occlusive agent — something to lock in the moisture. This guy pairs well with pretty much any other moisturizer so you can layer it easy. This is a perfect moisturizer for the summer. Wears amazing under makeup too. Just make sure to let it dry down some before applying.",4.6

My face always feels rough and I have tried SO many things to just have comfortable, glowing skin. I use this cream in conjunction with the propolis toner (first) and propolis ampoule (second) every night and on some mornings. The consistency of the gel cream does take a little while to get used to, but the benefits are just lovely. It absorbs easily, doesn't leave a greasy or tacky feeling once it's fully dry, and smells like absolutely nothing at all. For the first time in my adult life I'm left with skin that feels comfortable and looks nice enough to leave the house without wearing foundation. A little mascara and BB cream and that's it. I'm so happy I found this stuff, and if your skin sounds Ike mine I totally recommend giving it a shot. Especially at this price point!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Unfortunately this cream broke me out really badly. It left my skin feeling dehydrated and dry. Caused bumps and breakouts to form all over my face and neck. Definitely don't recommend.,4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I enjoy this moisturizer, a little goes such a long way. At first I felt it didn't moisturize enough but after my skin got used to it I couldn't believe how moisturizing it truly is. But it does make you shiny during the fry especially if you're oily like me but I still like it!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Length of Product Use: Almost a year Description: This cream is very moisturizing with a unique 'slimy' or 'stringy' consistency that really locks in hydration. Almost feels like a hybrid of a cream and gel. With this unique consistency, a little product can go a long way and still packs in plenty of hydration. Spreads and absorbs easily. Does not smell like anything and dries on skin leaving a healthy and hydrated glow. Lasts all day and leaves the skin feeling plump and elastic as per the description. My experience: My skin is normal to slightly sensitive, and dries out in the winter while getting oilier in the summer. I've used this year-round with no issues even when layered with moisturizing oils, mineral sunscreens, and makeup. Keeps my skin feeling fresh without any greasy heaviness. Results: This cream keeps my skin happy and hydrated and a little product goes a long way. Great price for the results. I've tried many other products and so far this one is the best! My holy grail daily moisturizer. Especially great in the winter when my skin dries out. I would only say not to slather too much on as it may dry slower and cause breakouts. Overall very pleased with this CosRX product! IMO best for normal to dry skin.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I love entire CosRx line it's truly life changing. I'm 44 and have been using high end products my entire life but lately my skin just looked tired, dry and unpolished. I switched and now I used everything CosRx right down to the blemish patches and in about 35 days my skin was renewed. It's moderate/high priced but well worth it, you just use a small amount.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,A WAY better gel like moisturizer than the Neutrogena hydro boost I'd been using. This also does not sting or irritate my skin after doing at home acid peels. Also doesn't have an chemical fragrance to it,4
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I wanted to love this product after reading amazing reviews on snail filtrate and even after purchasing. I used for about a month by itself for about two weeks then along with my other serums and products. I noticed on my jaw and cheeks to have more pore congestion which was definitely more noticeable over time with this product. I have complicated skin for lack of a better definition. I won't blame the product but definitely not for everyone,4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Please be careful before using this product and patch test first to see if you have snail mucin allergy. I got hives like allergy ALL over my body and it was awful. This is the only product I introduced and the rash went away once I stopped using. It was perfect for my oily, sensitive and acne prone skin though ): I was matte all day and night while glowing. My skin looked so healthy and clear but too bad I'm allergic.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"COSRYX is now my favorite skin care line. This moisturizes like no tomorrow. And you only need a little bit to slather on yr face, neck, decolletage, hands, arms. AMAZING product!",2

My only complaint is that it doesn't travel well. It ends up getting messy if it's not constantly upright and perfectly still",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,This makes my skin feel moisturized and dewy all day long. I even see a positive difference in my skin tone after 1 week of use! The only downside is it makes my eye area feel really dry and tight after a couple hours of wear,4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,it does not keep my dry skin moisturized at all. may be better for people with oily or normal skin but definitely not dry skin.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,i used the essence and then this and it felt really moisturizing going on but once it was dry i didnt feel like i was moisturized enough. It actually felt like it made my skin really dry and i normally have combo/oily skin.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,This is one of the brands that get snail goo without hurting the snails. They just let the snails slide around on a cloth which captures the goo without hurting the snails. Some brands do not take that care. Great product to use when doing something irritating like micro-needling or retinol bc it is so healing.,3
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"My friends thought I was insane to try any ""snail"" products. Well, not anymore. I've been using this for months and I've seen a huge difference in my skin. It looks much healthier with an inner glow. Even my skeptical friends have admitted that it's worked wonders on my 66 year-old skin. In fact, I'm going to buy another jar of it tomorrow.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This stuff does things to my skin that I've never seen before. the glow is WOW. It is so gentle and calming while being SO NOURISHING.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"It's a little slimy and sticky looking, but it spreads over my face just how I want it to. I usually put 2-3 layers on my skin (letting it soak into my skin after each layer). It's really helped my skin after moving from SC to AZ. My skin got severely dry and was flaking really bad so I had to change up my whole routine. This stuff has really helped repair my skin. Might be a little too oily for those with oily skin, but most of my face is dry (besides my t-zone) and my face has really taken a liking to this cream.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,It doesn't dry out my skin if I put it on while my face is still wet after cleansing. May as well put it in a pump and call it a serum lol. I like it personally I wouldn't recommend to oily skin,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Perfect daily product to use after you cleanse. It spreads easily across your face and it is smooth with no odor. A little goes a long way for sure. I used it daily and I used one jar (3.5 oz) for nearly 9months,3
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"ive had this cream for almost 9 months and though the texture seemed thick at first, i no longer notice that quality. in fact it's very lightweight and spreads effortlessly over the skin and has begun to function perfectly as an everyday moisturizer for me. i felt compelled to write a review after turning to this product after experiencing irritation on two separate occasions and using this as a way to calm burning and itching. my mom also started using this cream at my recommendation and it's the only cream that truly worked to calm her chronic allergy rash and inflammation. the quality of ingredients is amazing for the price. i gave away my perricone HA moisturizer because i was so irritated that it underperformed against this cream. cosrx is really a great example of a super high quality *affordable* brand.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I love this moisturizer and have love it (and all of CosRx snail products for years). This moisturizer is perfect on its own in the summer, but I use Exederm moisturizer under this in the winter. I have extremely dry skin, type 2 rosacea and horribly reactive skin. This has always been great. It's so gentle and makes my skin so clear and smooth. A good tip (for those who say this is so drying), put it on your face when your skin is still damp from cleansing. You should really do that with all of your products except actives....it helps lock the moisture into your skin! I will continue to purchase this moisturizer over and over and over again. It's great!",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I had no reactions which is great and my skin looked beautiful after putting this on but after a while my skin became very dry, so dry it itched (my skin itches when dried out, it's not a reaction to the item). Will only use again if it's an emergency.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I really wanted to like this product.. It felt very hydrating at first but soon my skin became irritated, dry and flaky. I have oily/combo skin and never had this issue before. Once I stopped using it my skin went back to normal.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I really wanted to like this product, because I love COSRX, and it had very good reviews—but after trying it day and night for a week, I had to return. Aside from the somewhat difficult and messy application (due to the slimy texture), this product did not work for my combination skin. After applying, my skin looked dewy and felt hydrated, but a few hours after the product soaked in, my skin felt tight and dehydrated. May be useful for individuals with oily skin.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Within days after my first use, I noticed that my skin was getting irritated whenever I put this on. It caused me to breakout on my chin and I noticed my skin was getting more and more dry with each use. It felt like it was moisturizing when I first applied it, but as it sank into my skin, it felt as if it was sucking all of the moisture out of my face. I gave it a week, but sadly had to return it, as my skin was so worn out from it.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I love this product so much that I now have my husband, two daughters and my son in law hooked on it!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I go through several of these a year. It helps with healing and plumps up my skin. This is a gel so not as longlasting a moisturizer as some. I add some active essential oils. I keep this bedside and pat a bit onto any dryness as needed. Love love love it.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I'm using it on my chest to try to clear up some of the sun damage that has been done over the years. So far, it feels great on my skin. The lady who helped me pick this out gave it rave reviews!",3

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I was so worried about this breaking me out because I have super irritable combination skin. But no, this is the only moisturizer that has prevented my skin from drying out to the point of bleeding this winter. It feels amazing and I love using it every morning. This was on my TikTok for you page and I'm so glad I bought it. Makes me face feel AMAZZZINGGGGGGG.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I used this cream for two weeks and loved it! I like the gel like texture it's refreshing and feels nice.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I love this product. A little goes a long way. I use this as the last step of my skincare routine before bed on my face and neck and it hydrated my skin (which is on the dry side) very well overnight.,5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I was using this for 4 months (on my second jar) and saw good results until recently it started burning my face. Not to the point that I couldn't tolerate it but it does cause slight redness now when I use it. I know it's the hylauronic acid. My skin is too dry and sensitive to tolerate it. After a few minutes the burn stops and it absorbs really well, leaving my skin soft and plump but I can feel the dryness aka TEWL. So I'll be returning this tomorrow :/ a little disappointed",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"As soon as I put on this cream my skin instantly turns red... the redness does only last for a couple of seconds but I will still avoid using this cream because it happens after every use.

Admittedly, I'm used to higher end skincare products, but am always looking for cheaper alternatives. This is weird. It's goopy, and slightly sticky. I was able to put makeup on top of it with few issues, but it added no benefits to my skin. I decided to try it a few ways, while my skin was still damp, and mixed in with my daily serums and oils. I was hoping for a hydrated feeling. I didn't get it, but it did give me a few new friends on my cheek, chin, and close to my eyebrow.",2

I tried this before and after putting on retinol (and just putting it on by itself after showering and cleansing). It was not moisturizing at all. My skin felt pretty tight and just didn't feel moisturized, so I waited a bit and even put on more. I woke up the next day to my skin being visibly dry with some flakes. This did nothing for me.

This is the mozzarella of face creams - it's thick and stringy. The smell leaves something to be desired. However, I was surprised by how well it absorbs and how bright and moisturized it left my skin. You don't need to slather it on either, just a dab did the trick for me.

My dryness/scaliness I get from using acne medicine and retinoid was gone with just a week's use of this. One less star because of the original price.,2

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This moisturizer left a weird film on my face after I applied it, and my skin almost felt dryer every time I used this? I didn't like it at all this literally did nothing for me I returned it",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"i use this as a nighttime moisturizer. thick enough w/o it clogging pores. it is pretty sticky though until it dries down. it's kind of a watery consistency more than a cream. you get A LOT of product in the jar, def can last you at least half a year.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Got this during the 21 days of beauty sale for 50% off. Was a great purchase for the sales price. Has a nice amount of product inside unlike many skincare products which are 90% packaging. Loved using this before moisturizer since it's humectant and not a moisturizer. Would recommend using with a product spatula since it's slimey in consistency which i actually quite enjoy. Works great with all the different moisturizers I tried it with. My dryness/scaliness I get from using acne medicine and retinoid was gone with just a week's use of this. One less star because of the original price.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I bought this based off all the good reviews and had very high hopes but was totally let down. First of all I don't even have dry skin, if anything it can be slightly on the oily side, but this product is so not moisturising that I started getting small dry patches in my t-zone where my makeup would stick and look flakey. So I started putting on a thicker layer of the product thinking maybe I wasn't using enough but that didn't help either because then the layer of the product starts to flake too and I have little white flakes coming off of my face all day even without makeup. The only good thing about this product is that it didn't make me breakout at all.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I put this cream on in the morning and at night. I typically have oily skin and this product does not leave your face oily nor dry! It helps with my hormonal acne too.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I was surprised by how much I liked it. I have drier skin and I typically only like rich, dense creams. And this product is very slimy, a little runny, almost gel-like. But it spreads easily and moisturized my skin really well! Works just fine under makeup. I haven't had any groundbreaking results or changes to my skin after using it for several months, but my skin feels smooth and hasn't broken out with this, which is all I'm asking for. I'll probably switch to something heavier for the winter but it's a good choice and you get a ton of product in the jar.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I never write reviews, but I love this product! As someone who's tried a lot of moisturizers, this one is by far the best for morning application. It doesn't disturb my sunscreen or makeup whatsoever and leaves my face feeling plump. I lovveeee the texture and experience this moisturizer offers, it's so cool! I have dry, acne prone skin, but I think this would be great for oily skin too. If you're someone who's looking for a great moisturizer and fun product, I totally recommend this.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Incredible for acne prone skin. I truly believe this has helped with the inflammation of my hormonal acne. If you're super dry like myself in the colder months, I would recommend looking into a thicker cream than this. It is lightweight yet very hydrating especially for oily/combo skin types. i top this off with vaseline at night.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This is a little hidden treasure. The texture is a bit slimey and hard to just get enough for your face but once you apply it to your face, you realize that a little does go a very long way. After application, I noticed during the day that my skin looked dewy, and my skin felt hydrated (not oily) I have oily/combo skin and it is light weight, does not feel heavy on the skin nor does it make my skin oily.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I've never tried snail byproducts but I am a huge fan after testing this out!!! I have sensitive skin and this didn't make my skin react at all. Will continue buying this! Definitely keeps my combo skin hydrated...will have to discontinue using my other hydrators as this beats them for sure!,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I am 31, with oily, textured skin. Bought this because of the hype. First, the jar is huge, bigger than what i was expecting! Have used it over a week, just at night and have not seen any changes. It does dry into my oily skin very well. Will continue to use and see. Have not had any breakouts. The texture of this is slimy and thin and stringy, but like i said, dries nicely once i rub it in.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I like the feel of this on my face. I use it every morning before applying my foundation. I also have been using it on the bumps on the back of my upper arms and have noticed smoother skin there as well.,4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Sadly, I won't repurchase this product because of the jar packaging. It is a very good moisturizer but because of the fluidity it is very messy to use. Change the packaging to a pump or tube and I'll repurchae.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I've been curious about this for a while so Ulta ran a sale on it, I jumped at the chance. I love this stuff! These snails are humanely treated which is important to me. The texture is gooey but not sticky. It's how do you think snail mucin would feel but definitely not sticky, slimy, or gross. It sinks in pretty quickly. I use it after my night serum but before my night moisturizer. I don't know the difference it would make if I used it in place of a night moisturizer. However, this definitely seems to boost the effects of my current products. My face is clear, hydrated, and looks so healthy. I have gotten several comments lately about how great my skin looks. My skin can be temperamental and break out with new products but it did not do that at all with this. I highly recommend giving it a try. Stick with it for two weeks and see if you notice a difference as well. At the very least, what a great conversation starter!",2

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I got this product because I like other cosrx products, and am trying to revamp my skincare routine. I have combo skin with acne scars, congested pores around the nose and chin, and some rough texture. I'm not 30 yet and want to heal my teen errors. This product, combined with my ole henriksen pha cleanser and ordinary niacinamide and zinc have worked together well to help decongest my pores and smooth out some texture on my cheeks and forehead, all after about 3 weeks. That said, with the season changing and the Midwest winds drying things out this moisturizer isn't enough to stop flaking on my skin. I have to add more through the day to soothe my face. I will likely keep using, because once I got used to the slick texture I really like this product, but just layer a thicker cream at night during the winter.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Had the product about a week. The texture is better than I was expecting because it looks more slimy than it feels. I like a lightweight, gel consistency, but some days this feels a little too light for even my oily skin. Overall I do enjoy it and it's really nice while the weather is still really hot in california.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,This thing is amazing. I never thought I'd love anything to do with snails but I'm sold. It helped my sensitized skin when I was dealing with over exfoliation. I use this everyday and I see a difference in my skin hydration wise. Great product and will definitely repurchase,5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Don't let uneducated people discourage you from trying this product. One reviewer claimed cruelty. Snails secrete toxins when irritated or on the defense so treating them badly would be counterproductive, the product would be unsellable. And salt? Do you know what happens to a snail or slug when salt is put on them? I don't know about other brands, but I've researched this one and the other reviewer needs to educate herself before spreading lies. I've really enjoyed this product so far. Sorry for ranting, but I can't stand it when people ignorantly spread misinformation. don't believe her, don't believe me, do your own research",2

But once it fully absorbed, my skin felt dry again. I would say if you have oily skin or combination skin, this would probably be hydrating enough, but in my experience, it's too light for dry skin. I'm bummed it didn't work because besides it not being super hydrating, it was a good quality moisturizer.",5

It leaves my skin glowing and usually my face is super super oily and I can visibly tell the difference on my forehead at the end of the day when I use this in the morning.

I'd do not expect much results after the first use but when I tell you my skin the next morning was FIRM and had a healthy glow, it really did! The acne marks on my face are slowly fading, small cystic like acne that was coming into my face ended up disappearing within the first week. After continued use, I have had no new acne and my face is finally getting a chance to heal. My mom (50+) noticed many fine lines within her forehead were tightened. I did some research and learned cosrx snail Mucin also has anti-aging ingredient that may have been the reason for my moms results. Overall, for such a good priced worth the product! Will purchase more as soon as the product is in stock again.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,i was using the cosrx snail mucin essence which i LOVED. i wanted to try this too. but i keep waking up with acne in places i never get it. no other new products besides this one. it's soooo moisturizing and i love the texture. a little goes a LONG WAY. i'm gonna keep trying it to see if it's just a purging period?,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I've never really experimented with K-Beauty. Recently, I kind of fell into a rabbit hole of Korean skincare videos and decided to give this a try. My skin is still recovering from a not so great experience with retinol. I find that after applying this it feels...sticky. I was afraid I would hate it! But after giving the product a little time to breathe and a chance for my skin to fully absorb it.. I love it. My skin feels soooo smooth and soft, and there's an immediate glow. I wake up and my skin looks bright and smooth, ready to combat the day :) DEFINITELY excited to try more from other brands!!",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I have dehydrated oily/acne prone skin. I absolutely love this product and have repurchased several times. It's not moisturizing enough for me to wear alone so I layer my Cerave moisturizing cream on top. It works great as an under-eye moisturizer as well! It does have a slimey texture right out of the jar but once you put it on it feels fantastic!!! I can't put into words what this actually does for my skin but I do see a difference.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Of course the texture is bizarre, this product is full of snail secretions! It is a wonderful product to use after taking makeup off or during the day when my face is severely irritated.",1
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"So I was skeptical on using snail products but once I tried cosrxs essence I knew I had to try this. The texture? Disgusting. Literally. How it makes your skin look and feel? Totally worth it. My skin is so PLUMP and hydrated and I owe it all to both of those products. 😍 if you're questioning getting it, do it. You'll get over the texture.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I have been putting this on nightly as my last step in my skin care routine since I purchased the jar about four months ago. The texture took me a bit to get used to but it wasn't a big deal. A very small amount of this product gets the job done. I am impressed with the results! My skin is soft and hydrated. I've also noticed an improvement in appearance. My skin has a tendency to look oily and I sometimes get red, blotchy patches but that hasn't been a problem lately. Despite daily use, I still have about half a jar left- a little bit goes a long ways! I will definitely our purchase another jar when I get low on this one!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I love this product so much. I'm on my third jar. I didn't know much about this product but just bought it because of the snail properties.

It's a mess lol. Most moisturizers for oily/combo skin are gel and I haven't had much luck finding one I like. Most of the time they aren't hydrating enough. Other moisturizers leave my face an oil slick. I was in the market for a new one and stumbled upon this. I've heard great things about the 96 Snail Mucin Essence and was excited to see it in a moisturizer form. It's got a very slimy consistency, but I expected that and it doesn't bother me. It's unscented as well. After you first apply it, it's a little tacky. But give it 2-3 minutes and it absorbs right into your skin. You can't even feel it on the skin and I've had no issues wearing makeup over it. I pair it with The Ordinary hyaluronic serum and I'm baby soft all day. It keeps dry patches at bay while never leaving me greasy and shinier than usual.

I noticed that as soon as I put it on after washing my face (while skin is still damp), my red face would almost immediately fade. This cream is definitely anti-inflammatory! It's only one week in, and I'm not sure I see an improvement in my pigmentation but it definitely doesn't look worse. In regards to improving my skin texture... my skin is the softest it has ever been! Granted that I use rx retinoid at night so I know I am getting some exfoliation there but this cream pairs very well in helping to renew my skin during the day.

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I love this moisturizer because it leaves my skin very supple all day, and because it is not heavy nor does it have a heavy fragrance.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I have dry, ruddy skin. this (used with the essence) adds so much moisture, has reduced my redness noticeably, and has helped fade my acne scars. it soaks in, and leaves me feeling soft but not greasy. price per oz is great too, if you can afford the upfront cost.",4.6

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I love how the product plumps your skin while moisturizing.,3
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I absolutely adore this moisturizer I have very dry skin and this is just the perfect amount of moisture. However, I do not recommend using this product then applying makeup over it. I've been testing it out with different products as well as my typical routine and every single time when I put this moisturizer on over my primer/foundation my foundation starts to bead up. Other than that one problem I highly recommend this product!",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This is a very interesting moisturizer. It is very soothing. Yes, the texture is slimy but, I think it feels really nice on the skin. It is not enough for my dry winter skin. I use it during the day in combination with serums and my spf. I do recommend it if, your skin needs some healing.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This completely changed my skin. I have combo skin with horrible hormonal, ingrown hairs and acne along my chin and this cleared that up! I use this daily and it does help curb the hormonal issue, but its a monthly thing that no product will ever be able to fully tame. I already have a back up and i'm only half way through my open one.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,This is a great moisturizer. I recently started using dermaharmony sulfur 10% and salicylic acid 3% soap so I wanted a gentle moisturizer that was hydrating but not too heavy. This is perfect! My skin had never felt so soft. I use a generous amount just because my skin absorbs the product so well and I don't have to worry about looking like an oil slick if I apply too much. It also gives that glass skin finish once it dries.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"my skin has been drying out thanks to changing weather with horribly low humidity and a change in birth control. i normally get hormonal acne once a month or with stress, we will see how that goes. but i literally bought this 4 days ago with the cosrx oil free lotion, and i can already see a massive difference in texture, tone, and hydration. i am a devout 10-step method follower, but i was still suffering dry patches and even some flaking! in 3 full days of adding both this cream and the oil free lotion though, i have no dry patches, no flaking, my red spots are reduced, and my skin doesn't feel tight anymore- that has been my constant complaint for years. im not getting super oily at the end of the day either- i could just mitigate it with a blotting paper. i have to use an extra high spf (currently 85, up to 100 in summer and never below 60 because i will burn) due to my job- im exposed to the sun coming thru the windows for hours, plus the aircon does not help with dryness- it actually spurs my skin to produce more oil to protect from the dry air. but these last 3 days ive not been itchy. or tight and dry. the oiliness from my sunscreen is diminished. this ish is just miraculous, is what im saying.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"It's nice and hydrating but acts more as a ""serum"" than a moisturizer. It can replace as a serum and would be considered a good price because of the amount but I don't recommend it as a last step moisturizer in skin care. It should preferably have an occlusive moisturizer, like the CeraVe face and body lotion, layered on top since the snail mucin is more of a humectant than a true moisturizer.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I absolutely adore CosRx, and I'm stoked that Ulta carries a wide variety of their line so I can try more of their products. Unfortunately, even with really strong, great brands, not everything works for every skin type. I'd wanted to try this as a new moisturizer, as what I'd been using made my skin a bit too oily, and I'd tried a snail based face mask a while back that made my skin super soft. I'd assumed that this cream would do the same. For starters, it seems REALLY goopy right out of the jar - but it's not sticky, and it felt like even if I put on too much, it quickly absorbed into my skin without leaving a film or a cast behind. Great, right? Except I noticed that during the day...my nose, my cheeks - they felt SUPER dry. Like I'd washed my face with steaming hot water dry. And whenever I put my sunscreen over it, it felt like it made the dryness worse. Over a few days of using this product, I noticed that I was breaking out in the same areas where I was feeling that excessive dryness - cheeks, chin, nose. So it looks like I'm going to be returning this!",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I use it as my night time moisturizer. My skin feels more firm and smooth. I like that it has virtually no scent. I get eczema on my face and it has cleared up in just 3 uses. Love this product!,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I purchased the product because I have very dry skin. I wanted a moisturizer and something healthy for my skin. This product does give you a glow, but its temporary, well at least for me. I used the product twice a day, in the morning and before bed. Its not a bad product but it leaves my skin feeling sticky,don't get me wrong I know its made of snail secretions,but I was hoping the sticky feeling would fade. I know after a week it wouldnt cure my dry skin but hoping some sort of progress.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I pair this with a heavy moisturizer when I need extra hydration, but I love how smooth it makes my skin. I know some people complain it's not hydrating enough, but again, that's why I don't use it alone. The main reason I love this though is because it's got a perfect pH between 5~6, which is the best for skin. Even the Snail Mucin Essence, as great as it is, has a pH closer to 6~7, but this cream keeps me balanced and clear.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This hydrates your skin like none other. I use it as the next step after my serums which I then follow up with moisturizer. It has a slimy texture but that doesn't bother me at all, it's snail secretion after all! I have dry skin and this somehow acts as almost a layer of water underneath my moisturizers making my skin glowy, supple and hydrated. I use mostly Exuviance for my skincare but this has been a great daily/nightly addition to boost my hydration levels and quench my skin.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I would swear that this gel is plumping my skin and my wrinkles look less pronounced. I have used it both morning and night as a moisturizer after cleansing. It absorbs really well into the skin and has zero irritation. A little goes a long way so this may last me a whole year!! I love it! May try other things from this brand next.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I LOVE this whole line. I first bought the Oil Free Moisturizer to try and it worked so well under my makeup! I have combination Acne Prone skin. It didn't leave a film or residue, and I have had less breakouts since using it.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I was so excited to try this face lotion since it has so many great reviews and was decently priced and was so, so disappointed when I used it for the first time! It is not nearly hydrating enough, not even as a daytime lotion, and it left my skin feeling dry and tight. Maybe if the serum is used with it, it would add more hydration, but alone didn't do the trick.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I have enjoyed other snail products in the past so when my old moisturizer ran out I thought I would try this. Only problem is after several days of use I can tell, this is not really a moisturizer. By itself it just isn't enough to hydrate my dry skin. It leaves me with dry patches. No good. It's more like a serum or something in my opinion. To be fair the how to use part of the description does hint that this needs to be layered but I didn't know that when I was shopping in store. More information- product doesn't really have a scent. Texture is very sticky, which I do not like. Dries to a matte finish after application. I will not be repurchasing, there are better snail creams out there, and they cost less, too.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Love this!! I stack my moisturizers since I need all rhe moisture I can get and this just gives a boost when im about to sleep or start my day. It doesnt leave any residue it absorbs quickly and its a light weight formula. I put this in the fridge too for a very refreshing moisturizer.,4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Keep my face moisture love it 😊,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This product is amazing. I was super hesitant at first and it was somewhat of an impulse buy because I had never heard of it and I don't usually buy products without reading tons of reviews first. But something told me to give this one a shot and I am SO glad that I did. My skin has never been clearer, softer, or more even. I have combination skin and this keeps my dry areas moisturized and my oily areas matte. I have a feeling the jar will last a long time, because it only takes a tiny amount to cover my whole face and neck. The one downfall I would say is the container it comes in. I typically prefer a pump or a squeeze bottle because it minimizes contamination, but I just make sure I wash my hands well before dipping in to the product to make sure it stays clean. If you're on the fence about this product, give it a chance. You won't regret it.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Let me start by saying that I have a massive dimethicone allergy as well as the most dehydrated and easily clogged skin in the world. My acne is mostly hormonal that ranges from cystic to small bumps all over the surface of my skin. Within three days of using this product I have already given up on every other moisturizer I have ever used. This has brightened my skin, truly hydrated it without causing any greasiness, and kept my acne soothed and at bay. I have tried probably hundreds of moisturizers geared towards every skin type and they have all caused an issue along the line but this product is the perfect texture and balance. You get an amazing amount of product and I will recommend this to everyone that I know.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I wanted to love this product but after about 4 days my skin broke out terribly. I had small bumps everywhere and cystic acne. Had such high hopes. Bummer.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"This stuff is freaky, but so amazing. I loved the essence they sell so I got this as a daily moisturizer. First of all, most moisturizers in gel form kinda dissolve as you stick your fingers in the jar, leaving you with less product every time (ie. Garnier) but this slimy stuff goes a long way. Takes about a week just to use up the stuff on the lid. Heals acne scars, smooths skin, and reduces acne. Snails are cool.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I was so excited when I found out that Ulta carries this brand and immediately bought this product. It feels nice when applied at first but it doesn't hydrate well and doesn't last all day.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I got this product feeling unsure...I haven't tried a lot of K-Beauty products, and I have pretty extreme combination skin. I break out all around my chin, but then my cheeks will be super dry and peeling. Also, my skin can be very sensitive to a lot of products. I usually rotate between a couple of Origins moisturizers, and sometimes Hope in a Jar by Philosophy- those are the only ones that have helped my dry spots and added a nice lively glow without breaking me out. This, however, is a game changer. It feels like a hybrid between a serum and a gel moisturizer. Give it a few minutes to dry, and it sinks right into my skin, leaving me glowy but nothing greasy or oily. I literally noticed a difference after one day of using it! Not only that, but it keeps my skin hydrated all day or night long! I've worn this under light makeup (when I'm not using a primer) and it works wonderfully. No separation or anything, although I do think it may cause foundation to apply a little less evenly if you're using something heavy. Regardless, great product for daytime or for nighttime. It also gives me a bit of a smoothing pore minimizing effect. Also, it's a great value compared to other products at the price point! The jar is huge!",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"Saw this at my local Ulta and became really interested, because well it's snail goop. My boyfriend and I tried it in the store and really loved it! I've been using it ever since and it feels amazing, it really helps tone down my eczema flare ups. My boyfriend has dry skin and it helped a TON he hasn't had any dry patches ever since!!",3
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I usually don't write reviews but lord, this is something that changes my face within days of use. My skin feels so smooth and my pores have shrunk and my skins texture is just so much better. Helps with pores, acne, dark spots, and doesn't make your face oily. It does feel weird getting it on. Feels a little slimy or so but it doesn't smell not feel sticky and it doesn't feel thick on your face where it feels like you got it caked on. It's an amazing product. I will be buying over again. I've pretty much use this and one of the toner at night and Mario badesco buffer. Lotion for cystic acne and my face has looked so good within days.",4
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I was super excited to buy this so I didn't have to wait a week to get a Korean moisturizer online. It felt really nice on my skin when I first put it on... days later I realized I got dry around my Tzone. I thought I just needed to get used to the product. But it has been two weeks since I have been using it everyday, and my skin got progressively dryer. And I have oily skin. So it's oil over dry patches. Doesn't feel the greatest nor make your makeup look good.",4.6

I wash makeup off and my center of my face (nose and surrounding area) is bright red all the time. I've been using this stuff about 3 -4 weeks and feel I can give an honest and thorough review. I was on the hunt for a silicone free moisturizer. I also want a moisturizer that actually delivers results beyond hydration. I stumbled on this stuff and was not let down. as far as moisture goes, I wear this under a heavy moisturizer. it has eliminated all the redness and drastically improved my skins texture. I do recommend.",5

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I bought this because Fiddy Snails said she uses it under her eyes and my eye area was flaking bad from a retinoid and I apply it all over my face too. I bought an airless pump jar to make it so I don't have to keep unscrewing the jar and dipping my fingers in. The texture is a little sticky at first but it absorbs quickly and has helped my dry skin immensely in a matter of days.,4.6

COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I heard that snail goop was good for your skin so bought this. The cream is the exact same texture as snail slime would be so it's kind of weird. It gets every where when you put it on, and a little goes a very long way. I've been using it for a few months, and don't notice a difference in how hydrated my skin is, or my skin's appearance.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I love this stuff so much. It completely retexturized my skin and gives it a nice healthy glow. I've tried other snail creams but come back to this one. It has a stringy almost sticky like consistency but I feel like that texture really helps with the glow. Lasts a long time too. If you're dry skinned you'll need another moisturizer and I usually put a little bit of on top of it especially at night. Im a little on the oily side so I use a Murad moisturizer that controls that during the day and a thicker one at night.,5

So, I was pretty excited about trying out the COSRX Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream. The cream does not break me out. That is a plus point. However, it does nothing to moisturize my face. I have to put on another cream on top of it so that I can make it through the winter. Disappointed.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I use this after cleansing and toning, has given my skin a healthy glow without lightening or dyring it out.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I'm a die hard Cosrx cult follower! I've never had good skin until I started using their products. However with this product I didn't know until about a week into using it that I started breaking out, and turns out some people have been having reaction with the snail mucin if they have dust mite/seasonal allergies. So just be cautious! I don't have a reaction to any of their other products though.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"It feels similar to hair putty & is tacky at first, but once applied, smooths out like a serum. I cleanse with Trader Joe's spa face wash, Clinique #2 lotion, apply the snail essence, at night apply the truffle oil serum (can't think of the name) & then use this moisturizer. My skin feels super soft already.",2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I had months with very dry skin during the summer which is unusual for me, I Love Korean products and was surprised to find Corxs at Ulta, this cream is amazing I saw changes in a matter of days. I even use it on some dry patches around my elbows.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"love this product and I'm so glad I found it! I have sensitive, acne prone, and combination oily skin. I have been using this plus the COSRX advanced snail 96 power for about 2weeks and I have already seen improvements. It does great for: wound healing, spot reducing, hydration, redness, fine lines and reducing my puffy eyes. All with NO irritation!!! Which for me is huge. I recommend this whole line to everyone seriously.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Loved it until it broke me out :/,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I've already tried the Mizon snail cream and my skin really enjoyed that product so I figured why not try something with more snail? This is a very nice product if you have oily acne prone skin because it is lighter than most moisturizers. Also snail is amazing because it will hydrate and help skin heal very well. I'm going to try the snail Essence next because that has an even higher concentration of snail.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Love this cream. I have acne prone skin and some scarring from past acne and this doesn't break me out or cause irritation. I've only been using it for a week but I do feel that it gives my skin a glow and wears great under makeup. I put it on after washing my face in the morning and night.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,I have been using this for almost two months and I love it! It's a lightweight moisturizer for my am routine.,5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"i have acne prone and sensitive skin with lots of hyperpigmentation. after using this product for months i instantly noticed how bright and moisturized my skin became! it's definitely evened out my skin tone and made it super smooth. i found the product sticky and weird at first, but once i used it every night you'll get used to the texture. once absorbed you won't even feel the stickiness. it does wonders and people have been complimenting me on how much my skin has improved.",4.6
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"I've been very into skin care lately and Korean skincare in particular. Most of the products from this line are great because they very straight forward with the ingredients and it works. This snail cream makes you feel like you're applying slime to your face but the result is so worth it. You're left with firm, radiance and glowy skin after daily use of this. Perfect for summer season and for people with oily/combo skin.",5
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,Love the texture of this cream. Very light weight and absorbs to the skin quickly. Although this cream claims it's an moisturizer it actually makes my skin feel tight but plump at the same time. I would not be able to wear this alone so I use this in conjunction with more rich moisturizer. As far as the anti wrinkles because it makes my skin plump and tight it does have a temporary anti wrinkle effect.,2
COSRX,Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream,$15.00 - $26.00,"After using this product for about a week, the skin around my mouth and jaw line got really dried out. I noticed it a couple days in but I thought maybe my skin just needed to get use to it but by the end of the week it was worse! I went back to my old cream but am still struggling with the dry patches that this gave me!",5
