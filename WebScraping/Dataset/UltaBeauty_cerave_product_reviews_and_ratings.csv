CeraVe is a reputable company and their products are effective. I like that his cream has peptides which help build collagen in the skin.

I am terrible at keeping up a skin care routine so I cannot speak about daily use and the effects of consistently using this product but when I have been able to keep up with applying this cream for more than two nights in a row, my skin looks healthier and more than anything that I wanted this product to do to rival the IT night cream is to reduce the inflammation of my acne.",1

CeraVe,"Skin Renewing Night Cream, Face Moisturizer for All Skin Types",$23.99,I had been loyal to a prestige brand for many years before trying this and I'm kicking myself for all the money I wasted. The cream is thick but feels whipped somehow- amazing texture. It absorbs fast but leaves me still feeling moisturized in the morning. And it's unscented. And a little goes a long way. It's darn near perfect.,3

I was an avid user of all things CeraVe for over five years. Had excellent skin due to their products and my routine. But this latest batch I've bought, both this night cream and their day lotion with spf, has been such a letdown. This night cream was weird. Some nights it was too greasy, other nights it wasn't hydrating enough and I had to use a facial oil with it. And the packaging is too small for what you pay. Night cream usually lasts me almost 2 seasons, this one barely got me through summer. I did not notice an improvement in my skin. I have combo/oily skin and I'm 40. Not worth it, don't recommend.",5

I started getting eczema flare ups on my face as I age (almost 31.) This and the Cerave ointment healed my face Eczema in only 3 nights! I also have SUPER DRY skin on my hands, especially in winter. I use this on my knuckles, hands, fingers, etc and it instantly makes everything baby soft. I am obsessed. Already purchased 3 jars within about a month or month and a half.

It also leaves your skin feeling super soft after applying it at night- I seriously sat in bed for like an hour just feeling how soft my skin was after applying it for the first time. It's so nice that I bought my little sister a bottle for Christmas and she loves it. She's a swimmer and always has problems with dry skin. I saw some reviews talking about the amount of product for the price point, a little of this stuff goes a long way and honestly compared to so many other brands this night cream is super affordable.

But, I'm not sure how other reviews are using this product but personally, I wash my face with the Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser, tone with the Hydrating CeraVe toner, apply this retinol on, and lastly, apply the La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+M Moisturizing Cream. The trick with retinol is that you have to wait out the purging and dryness period and pair this product with hydrating products, apply every third night or every other night, and APPLY SUNSCREEN in the day! Otherwise you will have issues with it like the other folks putting in bad reviews. Always do your research on how to pair it or put it on before diving in.",5

CeraVe,Resurfacing Retinol Facial Serum for Acne Prone Skin,$21.99,"I started getting loads of hormonal acne last year going into my sophomore year, and hadn't found a product that actually helped my skin until i got this. I decided to use this product thanks to a girl online named aleyssa farrugia who also struggled with acne as well and recommended it, so I decided to give it a try, and im so thankful she put me onto this!! I've had less hormonal breakouts(I obviously still have breakout's but usually 1-2 pimples every few weeks to a month) and my skin has felt smoother with it. I have a relatively normal skin type so i have no problem using it twice a day but idk how it'll be for others. And it wasnt irritating at all until i recently decided to see a dermatologist and they also assigned me benzoyl peroxide gel, so i thought it using the face wash with the gel would make it, ' more effective' but it really just burned around my eyes and nose😭(but that was more on me and not on the wash, plus the gel itself was pretty irritating for me anyway). But disregarding that, its not irritating at all and i higly recommend it!!",5
CeraVe,Resurfacing Retinol Facial Serum for Acne Prone Skin,$21.99,"I bought this after going through a few weeks of really bad breakouts. It cleared my larger red pus-filled pimples, but because it isn't non-comedogenic I started to get closed comedones. It definitely hydrates so I'll probably use the rest if this bottle sparingly when I get dry skin. I think a product marketed as treating acne should be made to not clog pores from the start though.",1

I know there can be a purge period. Im also aware of the drying affect it can have so I have simple hyaluronic acid moisturizer and serum on hand to use in conjunction. Unfortuantely even with all my patience and trust in the process I had acne in places like I was a teenager and fine lines and dehydrated skin like I was a person with mature skin (I'm in my late 20s).

My face is smoother, brighter and softer. I have stubborn dark acne scars/spots on my cheeks and they are basically gone now. This stuff is amazing. Only thing i recommend is to not put it anywhere near your lips. I got some in the corners of my mouth and it did burn it slightly and cause it to be raw.

At night before bed, I use the mincellar water wipe to wipe my face then apply two pumps of the PM moisturizer and one pump of the retinol serum at the same time that i mixed together on my finger. Its been 3 months and many of my acne scars are gone or going away, my pores are significantly less clogged they look significantly smaller as well. I still get pimples around my period, it's not preventing anything, but it helps for after. I also have been using it faithfully for 3 months and i still have plenty left.",1
CeraVe,Resurfacing Retinol Facial Serum for Acne Prone Skin,$21.99,The directions on this product here says to use it with the Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser. That has Benzoyl Peroxide in it. Make sure you do your research before you even use anything with Retinol in it. You aren't supposed to even mix it with AHA/BHA/Benzoyl Peroxide/Vitamin C/Glycolic Acid and more. You can use it with Hyaluronic Acid though. Retinol is very strong so only do it once a week when you first start. And slowly go up once your skin gets use to it. And make sure you MOISTURIZE!!!! Do not go without moisturizer. That is a must. Just make sure you research before using any products you've never used before. 💕,1

CeraVe,Resurfacing Retinol Facial Serum for Acne Prone Skin,$21.99,"I have oily skin and have always struggled with hormonal acne, and i have an impressive amount of acne scars, blackheads, and overall problematic skin. One thing i must note about this product that is often misunderstood, this WILL make you break out. This is a resurfacing product, meaning it will bring bacteria/buildup/gunk thats deep in your skin up to the surface to get rid of it. In a sense your skin will get worse before it gets better, but trust the process. This is called ""Skin Purging"" and is a very common process that happens with products that work. Ive used this product for months, maybe about 4 to 5 months, and i had skin purging for about 1 month until my skin finally calmed down. All in all, your skin gets worse before it gets better, and be sure to wear sunscreen and gentle calming products on your skin along with this. This product is very gentle feeling on your skin but trust the process! I highly recommend, especially for those naggy pimples that arent poppable but still visible and irritating to look at.",1

Do not necessarily have to add SPF since it is included, so that helps on busy mornings. - Good price. Cons: - Does not play well with other products! Pills with other skincare (especially hyaluronic acid) and under make up (even my most reliable products). - Can take a while to blend in without leaving a white cast.

CeraVe,AM Lotion Face Moisturizer with SPF 30 for Balanced to Oily Skin,$15.99 - $19.99,"I had high hopes for the CeraVe AM Face Moisturizer, but it fell short in almost every way. First, the texture is thick and leaves a noticeable white cast on the skin, which is a huge problem if you have a darker complexion or are in a rush and don't want to spend time blending. It also doesn't absorb well, sitting on top of the skin and leaving it feeling greasy throughout the day. The worst part, though, is that it pills on the skin no matter what I use underneath it—whether it's a serum, another moisturizer, or even just bare skin. It forms clumps and flakes off, making my face look dry and uneven. This completely ruins any makeup application or just leaves your skin looking awful on its own. To top it off, the pump bottle is frustrating, as it stops working long before the product is empty, wasting a lot of the lotion. Overall, this product caused more problems than it solved and definitely didn't live up to its reputation. There are far better options out there.",1

I've used it on both freshly clean skin and on skin that was just hydrated with water previously, still pills. And forget using it under makeup. Not only does it pill but it barely hydrates. I also have recently noticed more sun spots on my face, so I'm thinking the SPF is off in this batch too. Too late to return so I'm stuck with it.",5

Painful cystic acne that I' haven't experienced since I was a preteen. I used it for about 3 1/2 weeks and I'm stopping use today. My skin complexion was more even and bright before I used this product. No acne breakouts whatsoever before I used this product, just uneven skin complexion and a little dull. I was just looking to try something new for a little extra, radiance and skin texture benefits. I believe it's related to the niacinamide in this product. I've used niacinamide before and the same thing happened. I believe I have a sensitivity to it. Again, I was interested in this products claim to improve skin texture and radiance. Which it did nothing of the sort. My skin looks horrible now and I'm going to have to add a few acne related products into my routine until my skin calms down. Which is going to likely dry my skin out. This product threw a monkey wrench in my routine. 🥴 If you are looking for the same thing as me I would suggest Ceraves Vitamin C serum and a snail cream.

CeraVe,"Skin Renewing Retinol Serum, Anti-Aging Face Serum for All Skin Types",$26.99,"I hate giving a bad review, and I hardly ever leave reviews unless I feel strongly about something. Suffice it to say, I feel strongly about this one and feel I have to write something since they changed the formula up and I don't want people to have issues and wonder what the heck the old reviews in 2019 and years before were talking about. The original formulation in the tube was amazing. I'm in my early thirties, have combination sensitive skin (t-zone oily, everything else drier than the Sahara and it gets irritated easily), and I have a simple skincare routine that I had perfected and have specific products that I've used for a few years to minimize milia and breakouts in the t-zone and keep everything else on my face happy and moisturized enough. This stuff was my holy grail when it came to a serum. Then they changed this to the pump bottle and dropped the ""cream"" part from the name so it's just the ""skin renewing retinol serum"", which started happening right around December 2019. Okay, that was a little worrying. But I might as well try it out since I didn't really have a choice, as the original was suddenly impossible to find anywhere. I hoped for the best and that it wouldn't mess up my routine and it'd still be my HG and keep my skin happy. Point blank - It's not the same and it made my skin angrier than it's been in a long while. This is the only product I've used in the last few years that changed. After I started using the new one, I immediately started having issues with milia in my t-zone and major acne breakouts on my cheeks and chin that were reminiscent of my teen years. Not hard to figure out the new formula of this product was the issue. Really disappointed in Cerave for changing this and it looks like I'm going to have to experiment yet again to find something that works. For anyone looking at this or other products by this brand, just be aware that Cerave has been reformulating almost all of their products lately, so take any older reviews with a grain of salt and spot check to make sure you don't have issues.",3

During the day I wore the product under makeup, and at night just with moisturizer (both allowing the product to fully absorb before applying anything else). The product is easy to apply, absorbs quickly, is not greasy, and has no unappealing odor. So far I have seen zero change in the appearance of my forehead creases and frown lines. Perhaps my creases are too far gone for this product to help, but for me, it is not worth purchasing again.",5
CeraVe,"Skin Renewing Retinol Serum, Anti-Aging Face Serum for All Skin Types",$26.99,"First let me say that I really love all the CeraVe products I've tried in the past. I liked this one at first too--it feels hydrating and smooth on the skin, though thicker than I would expect from a serum--but it pills up after an hour or two. I do layer it with other skincare (CeraVe moisturizer/SPF in the morning and cream and oil at night), and I don't feel like it's enough to just use by itself. I've tried applying the other products immediately, I've tried letting it dry first--still pills up. If I sweep my hand across my face I get a handful of crumbles. It's really frustrating because I did want to like this, but it's all but unusable for me due to the texture. Oh well. (For the record, I used this to minimize texture and sebaceous filaments around my T-zone, not for wrinkles, so I can't speak to its anti-aging ability.)",4.3

I can't even get one little dot to come out. So tonight, as I'm squeezing the tube that obviously has a lot of cream left in it, trying to get a little dot to come out to apply, the cream explodes out of the backside of the tube all over me and my bathroom.

Almost scale-like. I had to take an antihistamine to reduce the swelling and even after that it took around two weeks for the itching and dryness to stop. To be clear; I have never in my life had a reaction to any cosmetic or skin care product and I have no history of allergic reactions of this nature. I have used the CeraVe facial moisturizer in the past with no issue and a couple years ago even tried this same eye cream and had no reaction to it, so my only guess is that the formula has changed in the last couple years.

Of course, most women have no problem with a lotion, they'll spend quite some time putting it on. Men do not have that kind of patience. I wanted a wipe that I could wipe on and be done with it. Well, this is it. The CereVe wipes are large enough to be workable (wish they were larger) and the neutral scent is just fine--in fact, after you wipe it on there is no scent that I can tell, but most importantly, the moisturizing properties are through the roof! So L'Oréal,, how about you increase the size of these wipes, add a little woodsy scent and put it in a travel pak that I can toss in my gym bag?",3

Mine almost smell like manure?? I have NOT had this issues with any other product which is why I am surprised. If you can get past the smell, the product is really nice.

But the smell is horrific to the point I can't use them. The smell like fish! Upon reading reviews here and on other sites, this seems to be mentioned frequently in recent reviews. I'm concerned there may be something wrong/contaminated in a recent batch. I can not imagine anyone willingly rubbing these cloths on their face. I'm hope Cereve investigates because as I said, I use and love many of their other products.",4.3

CeraVe,Plant-Based Hydrating Makeup Removing Face Wipes for All Skin Types,$11.99,I have been using Cerave makeup removing wipes for years and I love them. They work very well at removing tough makeup. I recently purchased the hydrating Plant based wipes by mistake and the problem I have with them is the terrible smell. I purchased two packages from different sources and I just can't get past the unpleasant odor so I will be going back to the original. Hope Cerave does something about this.,3

CeraVe,Moisturizing Cream with Pump for Balanced to Dry Skin,$22.99,"I'm sure some would argue with me about this product not being for those with truly dry skin. And that's fine. Everyone is different and entitled to their opinion. I'm simply expressing mine, in the hope that it may help someone who needs more moisture than this can provide. The upsides of this product? Contains ceramides. Has a functioning pump, making application quick and easy while keeping the product free from contamination. It also absorbs quickly and won't leave you greasy, sticky or shiny thus allowing you to get dressed immediately after application. The downside? It simply doesn't contain the oils and occlusives that truly dry skin needs. No matter how many times you might reapply, it isn't going to do what a more emollient cream does.

Which is a very painful disease with ulcers, for 10 years, I noticed the areas of my skin have slowly gotten worse. I use your moisturizer all day long every day. Then I realized your cream was thinner. People are using this for serious skin disorders. You think you can just change formulations and no one is going to notice. Americans are noticing. Boeing didn't think anyone would notice either. My Dermatologist at Vanderbilt told me to change to Eucerin. I've been in severe pain for 6 months because it took that long for me to catch on.

CeraVe,Moisturizing Cream with Pump for Balanced to Dry Skin,$22.99,"I bought this to compare it to gold bond, so I use it as a body lotion. It works well, not greasy. The only downside is I didn't realize this brand is not cruelty free, which really bothers me 😔",5
CeraVe,Intensive Moisturizing Body Lotion for Dry Skin and Itch Relief,$17.99 - $24.99,"Prior to previous cerave formulas I have tried, this is much more mousturizing, with a breathable feeling. I have combination, acne prone skin and since using this product, I have not experienced a breakout. My complexion has never been more clear. The only downside, is a slightly greasy feeling but it isn't too bad. Price point is affordable, and I would recommend this as a daily moisturizer",4.7
CeraVe,Intensive Moisturizing Body Lotion for Dry Skin and Itch Relief,$17.99 - $24.99,"This is better than their original lotion. For context, I have used CeraVe products since I was 15 years old and diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis on my hands (I'm in my mid-30s now). I still have the occasional minor flare-ups, but it's nowhere near as bad as it was when I was in high school (we're talking all over redness, extremely itchy bumps, dry/cracked skin, and significant bleeding). What I do deal with now is a damaged skin barrier on my hands from years of topical steroid use; I was diagnosed and treated before dermatologists knew topical steroids could be bad for you long-term. As a result, my hands are constantly dry and I am forever reapplying lotion to them, so I am always interested in moisturizers that are long-lasting. When I saw this new version of CeraVe lotion, I decided to give it a try. So far, so good! It lasts through a couple of hand washes, my hands feel much softer, and are retaining moisture better. This product lives up to the claims of not being sticky or greasy, which is great for someone like me who had to endure years of thick, greasy, occlusive creams and topicals. I will say it does take a minute to fully rub it into your skin - it doesn't dry quickly like Hempz brand lotion does, but to be fair, it provides way more moisture and lasts much longer between applications. The only downside is, if you have any open cuts or particularly dry patches from eczema or other skin conditions, it may cause a very slight stinging/itching, but it's tolerable and immediately goes away once the lotion is absorbed. I did deduct one star for this reason, because other lotions and creams have eliminated the ingredients that cause this, and it may be a deal-breaker for some people. Overall, I would recommend it and will likely repurchase until I find something better!",5
CeraVe,Intensive Moisturizing Body Lotion for Dry Skin and Itch Relief,$17.99 - $24.99,Compared to the original hydrating lotion this gives longer lasting results. It feels like it sinks so mych deeper into my skin and even if I don't reapply after a shower my skin is still noticably more hydrated with no product on it. It also isnt greasy or almost sticky feeling like a lot of itch relief or deep hydrating lotions are. I'd recommend this over the original daily lotion formula especially for the itchy dry skin girlies in the winter,4

CeraVe,Travel Size Moisturizing Cream for Balanced to Dry Skin,$7.99,"I've been using CeraVe for Lichen Sclerosis. Which is a very painful disease with ulcers, for 10 years, I noticed the areas of my skin have slowly gotten worse. I use your moisturizer all day long every day. Then I realized your cream was thinner. People are using this for serious skin disorders. You think you can just change formulations and no one is going to notice. Americans are noticing. Boeing didn't think anyone would notice either. My Dermatologist at Vanderbilt told me to change to Eucerin. I've been in severe pain for 6 months because it took that long for me to catch on. I will never buy your products again. I used to buy your product every month for 10 years. Shape up, you're messing with peoples health",1
CeraVe,Travel Size Moisturizing Cream for Balanced to Dry Skin,$7.99,"I wanted this product to be a holy grail moisturizer but both my skin and my husband's skin do not seem to care much for Cervae. On my skin which is oily, the product would just sit on top and seemed to hydrate the very top layer of my skin. For my husband who has KP bumps and significantly drier skin, the product would be absorbed within a couple hours and there was little to no textural difference in his skin even with reapplication. Overall this products works for other people, just not for me.",5

CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Face Lotion with Sheer Tint SPF 30,$16.99,"I use a Cetaphil face wash, Cetaphil sunscreen & CeraVe moisturizer that have all been my fave together. I had no idea this product existed and couldn't wait to love it. I'm not sure why ""non-greasy"" and ""non-comedigenic"" are even listed as details because it was the complete opposite. I even made sure to shake the bottle before applying so all ingredients mixed properly. I wore this indoors and looked sweaty all day. I should have removed it sooner because I just knew and felt it would cause a reaction. Sure enough, after showering and getting ready for bed, I had already noticed red bumps/breakouts on my face. I was lucky to match with the shade of tint, and aside from the cons, it was perfect coverage for me. The color blended so well with me.

CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Face Lotion with Sheer Tint SPF 30,$16.99,"I wanted so badly to love this product because its actually an affordable tinted sunscreen, but it is so bad! It says it is a non-greasy formula… but that couldn't be farther from the truth. This is the most greasy sunscreen i have ever used. It can't be worn with any makeup because it causes the makeup to break up within 30 minutes of applying. You also cant wear mascara with this because the greasiness of the product will cause the mascara to transfer to your lid… even if its waterproof! It also oxidizes a LOT so keep that in mind. I definitely wont purchase ever again and wouldn't recommend to any skin types.",4
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Face Lotion with Sheer Tint SPF 30,$16.99,"It feels like I'm putting on foundation and sometimes dries orange.

CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Face Lotion with Sheer Tint SPF 30,$16.99,"I can't say with absolute certainty that this product broke me out, but I can say I tried it for six days and broke out in spots I don't usually break out. I checked the ingredients on an online ""pore-clogging ingredient checker"" and found that this product DOES have pore-clogging ingredients. Although correlation doesn't equal causation - this product feels a little thick, making it a little hard to blend. It also feels oily/greasy on my face. It was a relief to see that it does have pore-clogging ingredients because that meant I could throw it away and feel a little less guilty about it. It's a shame because I love Cerave's AM lotion with sunscreen, and this product is budget friendly. If you have extra cash, try this product out. It might be for you, it just wasn't for me.

I also love this for my hands if they get a bit dry in the colder months. This is also great to help with any cuts.,4.5
CeraVe,Healing Ointment to Help Protect & Soothe Dry to Very Dry Skin,$10.99,"This scent-free ointment is nice and thick, but in terms of effectiveness it's just okay.

It doesnt pill under makeup, its lightweight, and doesnt smell at all. I dont think its oil free based on the packaging, but it doesnt feel oily.

CeraVe,Ultra-Light Facial Gel with Hyaluronic Acid for All Skin Types,$19.99,This sample I received of this ultra light gel cream is really a bummer. I found that it absolutely did not smooth my skin. It was lightweight but the moisture in my skin only seemed to last a few hours. I really was not impressed with it at all it has no scent so that is pretty much it. I guess if you want a super lightweight moisturizer that would be great if you just want a few hours of hydration.,4.7

I use a lot of other CeraVe products and love them so I had high hopes for this. However, as someone with dry and sensitive skin, this product did not work for me. Shortly after applying, my skin already felt like it was just as dry as before and hadn't been moisturized. After about the first day I also started noticing a splotchy red rash, red bumps, acne, and whiteheads in the areas where I'd applied the moisturizer. After doing some research on the ingredients and comparing it with other CeraVe products I use that don't cause a reaction, I feel fairly confident that my reaction is a result of the use of one or both of these ingredients, propanediol and chlorphenesin.",3
CeraVe,Ultra-Light Facial Gel with Hyaluronic Acid for All Skin Types,$19.99,I've been using this moisturizer daily for months now. It doesn't leave residue or a sticky feeling on my skin.

This gel is so lightweight and absorbed very quickly. I used it on my off day. Once in the AM and PM. I also did not use any other products with this. My skin felt very moisturized and clean! Very Clean! Zero residue and I had no reactions from this what so ever. I will definitely be buying a full size of this. This has such a very clean feeling on my face. CeraVe is a common product, but I will definitely look at the big box stores for the whole line.",5

CeraVe,Ultra-Light Facial Gel with Hyaluronic Acid for All Skin Types,$19.99,"I usually love gel moisturizers for my sensitive and acne prone combo skin but unfortunately this one left me disappointed. The consistency was nice immediately upon application, but within minutes my face felt super dry as if I hadn't applied a moisturizer at all. It certainly does ""absorb quickly"" as it promises. However I'd expect my skin to be left at least a little hydrated after absorption. I'll give it a star for being non irritating at least, because even the OG Cerave cream burns my face sometimes and this product did not. I'll probably just end up giving this to my husband who has a much oilier skin type, hopefully it will work better for him than it did for me.",5

I have combination skin and have struggled with pretty severe acne for around 10 years. I did a cycle of acc*tane about 2-3 years ago and have been using CeraVe products ever since to try to manage it. I still get pretty severe hormonal acne. My skin is extremely stubborn and does NOT respond well to most products. Everything makes me break out! I had been using CeraVe moisturizing cream for years and yet it just felt too heavy on my skin, but lighter moisturizers from other brands caused my skin to become irritated and dry. After starting to use this gel my skin IMMEDIATELY started clearing up - it hasn't been this clear since I did my acc*tane cycle! I very highly recommend if you have skin like mine.",4.7

I developed perioral dermatitis around the nose, mouth, and around the eyes; redness; and severely dry and cracked skin around my nose that flaked and pealed that was very painful and itchy. Nothing I tried helped. I used dermatologist recommended thicker creams and ointments tailored to dry cracked skin with no improvements. I got this lightweight gel for Christmas and have only used it for the past week in addition to the Cereve Hydrating Foaming Oil Cleanser and it has completely turned my skin around.

This gel oil has already made a difference in my skin care routine's effectiveness. It has absolutely improved the hydration of my skin and fine lines around my eyes are looking less noticeable.

I love that, because it's a gel, it never leaks out of the package so it's never messy. It never breaks me out or flares my sensitive skin. A bottle lasts forever.

I've tried using this product after washing my face without using the serum, and it still pills. It's super annoying. I also feel like it just sits on top of my skin and doesn't absorb well.

Anywho i knew when nothing else worked i needed to go back to 2% salicylic acid. Thats been my best friend since i discovered it early in my 20's. It ALWAYS works to clear my face and its done it again. Its only been 4 days since getting this and my skin is looking so much better. No active breakouts right now, it dried all those up and will continue to help stop more from producing. I need to stick with products like these. Should have never doubted",4.3

However, after just one use, my face was covered in small bumps, and it has now been three days and the bumps are still there. I'm honestly not sure what to do about it. I have heard about the idea of skin purging, but I am terrified to keep using the product based on these results after the first use. This product may work well for people with different skin texture and dryness level, but it just didn't work for me. I will definitely have to consult with a dermatologist before continuing with this product. I'd love to find a cleanser that works for me and controls breakouts. This one is just not it.",1

It also works great for eyeliner and eyeshadow. There's 0 scent which I prefer. I put this product on a cotton ball and everything melts off super easy. The ONLY issue I have with it is that if it gets in your eye and you're not super careful, it will cloud your vision for a few minutes. When I use it really carefully I don't have any issues.

CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Face SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$15.99,this is the WORST sunscreen I have ever used. picked it up because the tinted one is too dark for my complexion. even just minimal product leaves a horrible white cast. I am very pale and it turned me PURPLE!!!! for hours after application. i guess it works because i havent been burnt but it is truly not a good product. buy ANYTHING else.,1

I know most of the reviews are complaining about the white cast but i was able to mix in bronzing drops with mine and then apply makeup over it to solve that problem. What i couldnt get past was the SMELL! It smells so incredibly bad and the smell lingers. For a very long time. And God forbit u get some on your mouth and taste it! To me it smells like burning rubber. And hours later i will still get wiffs of the smell. Its really bad. I honestly thought I purchased a defective bottle because of how rancid the smell is, and is the only reason i came and looked at the reviews. It is an SPF 50 and mineral sunscreen so at least it has that going for it. Other than that, this product is a major flop from a company that imo has always put out good reliable affordable products. Very disappointing. Dont waste your money.",1

Every relationship has its issues. Not a deal breaker. So, after applying, after a few minutes, I brush on some MAC Studio Fix in my usual NC20 or NC25. Yes, I am a bit shiny, but I have oily skin and am shiny 24/7 regardless. So what? Dewy glow is in. So, this is my holy grail sunscreen.

CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,I wanted to love this since it's CeraVe and mineral and SPF 50! But it's very messy with a significant white cast. It doesn't absorb well and gets on clothes and makes me look so pale. I will still use it probably for things like yard work where I don't care about mess or how I look but I don't like it when I care about my appearance or about staining my clothes.,1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"I don't why so many people hate this. It is my holy grail mineral sunscreen. It works and doesn't flare my rosecea or excema. 1) It is fragrance free. It doesn't smell at all. I am picky - -and I noticed no smell. 2) Mineral high spf — no irritating chemicals 3) oil free and noncomodogenic 4) it works 5) gluten free - I am celiac and get a rash and excema from topical or oral gluten 5) it doesn't make my skin burn or itch like all of the chemical sunscreens 6) yes, it leaves a whitish cast on my light olive skin. So, after applying, after a few minutes, I brush on a light bit of MAC Studio Fix in my usual NC20. Yes, I am a bit shiny, but I have oily skin and am shiny 24/7 regardless So, this is my holy grail sunscreen. Yay! I have to wear it because I have developed hyperpigmentation and have to use trentinion at night and The Ordinary Niacinamide everyday.",1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,Not brown skin friendly. It least major white cast like I look so ashy :(,1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,This is a lightweight sunscreen with SPF 50. Highly recommended for sensitive skins ! My sensitive skin child only use this sun protection sun screen. The only downside to this is it's not water resistant.,2.6
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,Protects face from uv without greasy texture. Sleek packaging with no strong sunscreen smell. Leaves skin moistured without worry of acne 😊.,5
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"I purchased this while on vacation, when I realized I had forgotten to pack my sunscreen. Ulta was out of my usual brand and I purchased this instead because it was just about all that was left. Now I know why - it leaves your skin super white.",1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"Do not recommend for people of color or anyone else who doesn't want to look like a mime. The white cast is horrible and no amount of rubbing it in helps. The texture is tacky and it rubs off on clothes or any surface I touched. Just to add to the fun, you need hot water, an oil-based cleanser, and lots of scrubbing to wash it off. (The hot water and scrubbing aren't great for sensitive skin.) There are mineral-based sunscreens that make you look less ghostly, and that don't require a trowel to remove. So I will never buy a Cerave sunscreen again.",4
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,I returned this sunscreen to the store for a refund because it smelled like moth balls. It is the worst smelling sunscreen ever! I wore it a couple times to see if it was my imagination but it was definitely not. I have had basal cell skin cancer and thought this would help but there is no way I would wear it. How could a product pass inspection smelling like moth balls! I have had other mineral sunscreen brands and none smelled bad.,5

CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"Me and my friends tried this sunscreen for the first time and it did not spread when trying to. We used a little bit and it left a white residue instead of being rubbed in how a sunscreen should. We then tried to keep rubbing it in and it didn't work out, it just dried up on our skin still leaving us white.",5
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,This is for lifeguards in the 70s protecting their nose. It does not absorb and whitecast is an understatement,1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"cera ve products are great, but not this one. i should have realized how low the rating was for this. anyways this sunscreen left my legs WHITE. it did not absorb into my skin and i even took a shower the next day and it didn't dare to get off. i do not recommend this.",5

CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"I bought this for an upcoming trip but will not use it. I tried it on my arm and my arm looks white, I can't imagine going out in public looking like a ghost. I'm sure it does a great job if being ghost white doesn't bother you.",2.6
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,Great for combination skin. Mineral sunscreen containing Zinc oxide and Titanium Dioxide . It's is smooth but there is white cast so it tone up your skin. Not easy to apply by rubbing it fully into the skin,5
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"Muy malo , lo compré confiando en el renombre de la marca y literalmente he tirado mi dinero a la basura, deja un efecto blanco en la cara horrible tienes que tallar y tallar para que desaparezca y nunca lo hace además no es para nada ligero.",1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"Discontinue this nightmare. I am avid sunscreen junkie, and love most cerave product. Not only this not usable on a face I can't even use it on my body. It sticks to everything. I ruined my clothing even after wash the white won't come out. Ruined my favorite leather jacket simply because I brushed with my skin passing by. Ruined sits and everything that I have touched with my skin in a car, won't come out. This is sunscreen of destruction no one needs.",1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"The good: It doesn't have a smell. The bad: It's greasy and leaves a white film on your skin that comes off on EVERYTHING. Your clothes, your car, the chairs you sit in. Everything. I used it for every day use, so maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I only used it for the occasional beach day. The white cast also makes your skin appear a pale, unnatural color.",4

CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"After reading and following the directions for applying CeraVe Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen, I was disappointed to find that a white residue was left where the product was applied. It also remained on the neckline of my swimsuit after being in the pool for 30 minutes. I have used other mineral based sunscreens with success (Blue Lizard). I thought I would try CeraVe sunscreen because I like some of their other products. This particular product was a disappointment and I would not recommend purchasing it.",1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"This is perhaps the worst sunscreen I have ever used. I rarely feel motivated to write reviews but this is just so unpleasant to use that I felt like I needed to. The company describes it as lightweight and non-greasy but it's more like the texture of the stuff you use to patch the holes in walls. Like wall putty, it is impossible to rub in. If you try to rub it in and hope it will blend under makeup, it won't. It stubbornly stays put and pills up if you try. The end result is that you've got a flakey, pilled, bright white mess all over your face. I am the whitest of the whites but this white cast turns me into a sickly Victorian child with some kind of skin disease. Unusable. I wish I were exaggerating.",5
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"Very disapointed. Love their body lotion but this is a no go. Way to thick. Does not go into skin. Ive got it all over my clothes, hats & sandals. I am returning this product.",2.6

CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,will not rub in! I looked like that guy from the movie Powder. Not exactly a look I want! I ended up having to wash it off!,1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"pros: not greasy, works very well cons: you will have the whitest tint on your skin until you literally scrub it off.",1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"Unlike most sunscreens, this doesn't really have a smell to it which I like. I also like the consistency of it, from my experience, it doesn't pill. One thing I dislike about this sunscreen is the fact that it stains the leather on my car, leaves this white stain if any part of me touches the leather, which sucks, but it does come off once cleaned…",2.6
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"So, like everyone else, I really disliked this sunscreen. It doesn't blend into your skin— it sits on top. You'll DEFINITELY look spooky. And it stinks. But here's the thing— I have literally never have spent a full day outside / on the water without getting burnt. I spent 10+ hrs ourside on the 4th of July and I got ZERO sun. This was with a wonky application, being in water, and tubing. I have vitiligo, so sun protection is of upmost importance to me— and this did the trick. Is it awful? Yeah. But it does what it is supposed to, and for that, I'll continue to use.",5
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,It did the job but i definitely recommend it for the beach rather than if you're going to an actual event cause the white cast will make you look silly!,1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,This sunscreen it super hard to spread and leaves you looking ghostly with a huge white cast all over your face/skin I tried it a couple of ways but it did not spread at all,4
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"I LOVE this sunscreen. I'll be outside for hours, reapplying, and I won't burn. BUT BUT BUT: as a pasty person, I look like I passed away with how white this makes my already white skin. I really wish it didn't have so much white cast as I love this sunscreen.",3
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"My review is so very similar to others. I would like to give a zero. I looked like a ghost. Almost impossible to remove. Won't use this again. Thought it would be a great product, as other CeraVe are.",2.6
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"Although I normally love Cerave products, I did not like the white cast that was left on my skin after using this product. The white cast actually made people question the health of my skin as my skin actually looked ashen and mottled in the sun. I will not purchase this product again.",5
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"I love so many Cerave products. Thus, I was shocked at how terrible this sunscreen is. It does not rub in AT ALL, and leaves the most horrendous white cast. I'm a pale girl I look spooky on my own, this managed to make me spookier. Save your money!",1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"I am begging CeraVe to please re- formulate this. I honestly will never buy this again until it does. For reference I am a pale, sensitive red skinned, blue eyes girl. I am used to having a little white cast which I understand comes with physical sunscreen, but what I got from CeraVe'a mineral sunscreen is unreal. The formula left a lot of white cast and didn't work almost at all. Everytime my skin touches something it leaves a sunscreen print. I can't imagine anyone of color can ever use this sunscreen. If you're reading this skip CeraVe mineral sunscreen results from it. I used CeraVe on my body and a different physical sunscreen on my face and had way better results on my face.",1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,This sunscreen has got to be the worst thing I've bought in a long time. Do you see how it looks like I rubbed dried out body paint on my arm? This shouldn't exist and no one should but it. Do better CeraVe.,2
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"This product has such a terrible white-cast i looked blue. For reference, i am incredibly pale. Dont buy this thinking youll avoid the white-cast - you wont.",2.6
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,DON'T BUY THIS. It doesn't absorb at all and you look like a clown.,5

CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"This sunscreen does NOT rub in well. Whole family used it because a lot of us have eczema and we were fishing. No one got sun burned and my mother said her skin felt amazing. That being said, we all looked like ghosts. This sunscreen doesn't wash off well and it doesn't rub in or absorb ever. Don't suggest with makeup use or if you want to look nice, but it won't aggravate sensitive skin and it does work for sun protection. Personally, I'll probably keep looking for a better option.",1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,This will not blend into your skin at all. It is thick and stays white on top of skin no matter how much you blend (which isn't easy since this is thick) and no matter how much time has passed,1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"Well, I experienced what everyone else has with the white casting and it not rubbing in well. I applied it for the first time yesterday before going outdoors and it's still on my skin between every little nook, cranny and fine line or wrinkle on my body.",2.6
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,"Oh man… as a skincare enthusiast, daily sunscreen wearer and Cerave loyalist, I REALLY wanted to love this sunscreen so much… but it simply isn't great. I regularly wear mineral sunscreen, both alone and under makeup, so I am familiar with the idea of a ""white cast"" being apparent following the application of mineral UV filters on most skin tones. I am fortunate to have an ultra fair ""porcelain"" skin tone that is generally not impacted by this occurrence though. Of the eight (8) mineral UV lotions currently in my rotation, this is the only one that is obviously and LITERALLY leaves my face, neck and ears looking white and pasty once applied. No amount of rubbing, spreading or allowing time for this product to sit on the skin alleviates the obvious ""white cast"" issue. Wearing this over serum and moisturizer yields the same crusty result as wearing it on clean skin alone. Unlike other hydrating SPF 50 products at this price point, it is definitely not suitable for use as a makeup base or primer. Though this sunscreen does not meet my requirements for regular daily use, I can honestly say it DOES work well as a protective skincare product. This is the one I reach for on ""no makeup"" days when I am gardening and doing outdoor tasks during high UV times as well as those that require limited interaction with others. My skin never burns, does not become reactive, and always feels hydrated with no irritation after removing this sunscreen. If you are looking for a heavy duty sunscreen that provides skincare benefits and lasts in humid climates, this one works well. However, I can only recommend it in good faith with the knowledge it will not blend evenly or not be noticeable unless you are literally a ghost.",5
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,This is the worst sunscreen I've ever put on my body! It didn't dry it left me so white that I was transferring onto my clothes and my fiancé was making fun of me calling me ghostie. It never dried I waited over 30 minutes and had to scrub it off of myself. I used the smallest amount I could and it wouldn't spread or rub in.,1
CeraVe,Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Body SPF 50 for All Skin Types,$17.99,I will be returning this product it's awful! It left me white and chalky and wouldn't rub in so I looked ridiculous. The only thing worse than the lack of spreading is the smell. I've never smelled so disgusting in my life. I don't even know how to describe the wretched odor it leaves on your body. The odor is also so hard to get out. The sunscreen also gets all over clothes even if you wait 30 minutes before dressing.,2
