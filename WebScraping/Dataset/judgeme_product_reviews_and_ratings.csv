Cosrx,COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner,"PKR 3,536.74","I am someone who didn't use a toner in my skin-care routines but I wanted to give this a try since hearing so much about it. And I must say - Not disappointed at all! It is such a mild toner, it balances the ph of my skin since I apply it after washing my face. I have been using it since 2 weeks only at night. But I can see that my pores (don't have large pores on my skin, only few on the apple of my cheeks and some on the nose) have cleaned up, my blackheads have also reduced somewhat as well as whiteheads. Now I want to clarify that I am using other products as well on my skin - like Serum and Face Cream. But still I feel that the other products don't have anything in them to clear up the pores or blackheads so it could be credited to this toner. I spray some of it on my face since it comes with a spray-on and even though it's AHA-BHA the %age is very minimal, it is very mild (at least for my skin-type - Combination (Dry with Oily T-Zone
). It hasn't caused any breakout for me.",4.0

Cosrx,Cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad,"PKR 6,411.15","I have textural issues, so rly bad White and blackheads, followed up w some acne. I haven't been using this product very long but so far, I like the results. It smoothened out my skin, ESPECIALLY when I use the Dr. Jart+ cicapair derma cream solution cream. The appearance of my pores aren't as visible as before. And I'm very happy ab my skin. I personally like the smoother side better than the textural side Bc it feels like I'm scraping my skin since my skin is so badly textured and it feels a little harsh. Maybe when my skin is a little smoother, it'll glide on nicer. I rly reccomend this product! Only use 1-3 times a week tho Bc it does contain Salicylic acid and it could potentially dry out ur skin. Ppl say u can use this in place of toner but my face feels dry afterwards due to the bha I'm guessing ?

Reviewers have mentioned that it only works for pimples that are about to pop but actually I find that it works on any pimple, it just takes a really long time! Its not 5 stars because it does take some time to work and sometimes you run out of time and have to take it off before it's done, wash up, reapply -- you end up burning thru a couple.

Cosrx,COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch (24pcs),"PKR 1,377.96","Very simple to use, you are presented with 24 pimple patches with 3 different diameters which you place - according to the size of the acne - on top. Essentially you see this patch go from transparent to slightly opaque and that when you know the patch absorbed all the trapped oils inside the pimple. It does more than just the job - I really like the fact that this also prevents me from picking my skin, preventing more acne near the surrounding region and most importantly preventing post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The patch is also quite thin so you don't really feel it on your face. I don't wear much makeup but I presume it would be easy to use foundation on top of this.
I usually wear these patches overnight and they don't come off even with a lot of tossing and turning. It's also interesting to note that the patch, although adhesive, doesn't have a sticky residual feel after removing it. I've also found that this works best on clean, dry skin.",5.0

Cosrx,COSRX AHA BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner 150ml,"PKR 2,906.27","This was my first time using Cosrx products and I have to say, I‚Äôm very impressed. My skin is very oily and I have a lot of black heads and small white heads that lay deep beneath my skin. Prior to using these products, I would rub my face and feel so many little bumps beneath my skin and my face just felt awful to touch. Ya know that feeling when touching your face just puts you in a bad mood? ... like that!
Since my skin was oily, I choose mostly the BHA products since BHA loves oily skin. After cleansing my face, I start with the [Cosrx] AHA/BHA CLARIFYING TREATMENT Toner, then apply the [Cosrx] Bha Blackhead Power Liquid (It is a liquid but with a bit more consistency than water & leaves your face feeling moisturized), next the [Cosrx] Natural BHA Skin Returning Emulsion. At this point my face feels so fresh and soft, not greasy. However I also love to apply the Cosrx advanced snail 92 all in one cream to my face and neck as well. Now if you have the time, I suggest leaving 10 minutes between applying each product. (You‚Äôll most likely have that time in the evening before bed) It just helps the skin absorb the ingredients separately for better effectiveness rather than apply a jungle juice of ingredients at once.
After only a few days, WHAT A DIFFERENCE! My skin feels so much smoother, soft, less irritated and far less oily. My makeup sits so much better now.( Although if you are going to wear makeup, I would suggest not applying the snail cream.) I absolutely can‚Äôt stop touching my face! Seriously.

Cosrx,COSRX AHA BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner 150ml,"PKR 2,906.27","I'm in love with Cosrx! I've been on a mass shopping spree for Cosrx products since coming across the brand. I saw Cosrx featured on a few beauty blogs / videos as a company that's good for acne scarring and people that have acne problems. I'm in my 20s and still get acne so I really wanted products to help with that.
I've really noticed my skin improving since switching to Cosrx - my skin feels a lot smoother. This product in particular is meant to maintain the skin‚Äôs optimal pH level and prevent whiteheads and blackheads. I still do get whiteheads, but they are nowhere as big as the ones I used to get - the whiteheads I get now are much smaller and very manageable. They go away quite quickly compared to the ones I used to get. You're supposed to use this with a cotton pad - you spray it onto the cotton pad and wipe you face with it to exfoliate. It comes with a spray nozzle, so it's super easy to spread on a cotton pad! Not all Cosrx products come with a spray nozzle, so this is a great feature. I find my skin really feels fresh and not dried out at all when I use this! I'm hoping with continued use, all my whiteheads will go away.",5.0

There is no real strong scent to it, and it feels refreshing. As per the instruction, the trick is to use it on a cotton pad, which acts as an added very (very very) gentle exfolient, suitable for everyday use.",4.0

Cosrx,Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence,"PKR 6,968.64","It must be close to 3 years since I started using Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence. I use it at night after toner and essence before thicker serums or right after acid or OTC retinol. I like the hydration it provides. If not using it when i run out while getting it shipped my skin gets slightly more irritated. I have come to appreciate it even more when I started using strong acids for exfoliation and otc retinol on a regular basis (i use drunk elephant). This essence provides a shooting/calming effect that I believe helps decreasing irritation when my skin is going thro some rough time (seasonal, hormonal, over- exfoliation / retinol). I can definitely tell my skin benefits from using specifically this essence over other multiple toner or essences I have try. It has become an staple.

The texture was less slimy than I had anticipated, but will give you a positive ""string test"" between your fingers. It applies with a slightly tacky feel, but when layered with a face oil, moisturizer and SPF does not cause any issues with makeup application. It does provide some instant hydration, which for my skin was enough in the summertime but is inadequate now during the winter. I find that I need more layers of toner beneath this essence (have yet to try the 7 skin method!) to achieve the same degree of hydration, so this for me wasn't exactly a holy grail product. Nonetheless, I feel that layering this product does somehow help to smoothen and almost prime my skin, which is why I am persisting with this product through the winter months.

About the texture, well, I would say it‚Äôs not grainy enough for awesome results, but maybe a beginner to exfoliation would enjoy it. It could be better but, well, I would repurchase it a thousand times just for the smell.

. The results are not great really I have been using it for many days now and I really don't see significant changes in the way my skin feels
. But on the good side, this face wash is very refreshing and is not harsh on skin, I highly recommend if you have oily skin as this face wash will keep the moisture but will remove the oilyness.
. Overall a average product, nothing special.
