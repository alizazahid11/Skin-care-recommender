The Body Shop,Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,$12.00,I only bought it because it was in the clearence section but it's not even worth it. Instead of moisturizing it leaves a horrible film on your skin that's a sensory nightmare and doesn't go away until the next day basically. Would not recommend,1.5
The Body Shop,Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,$12.00,"Listen to other reviewers amd save your money. Sticky and filmy. Feels sticky hours later. I miss Body Shop's older formulations. Vegan, of course, does not mean natural. This is like using petroleum jelly's crunchy cousin.",5
The Body Shop,Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,$12.00,Absolutely love this brand and smell! So moisturizing and absorbs into the skin leaving me so soft and comfortable.,1
The Body Shop,Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,$12.00,"So this item has gotten so many bad reviews because its old product. TBS isnt making new product for the US market, so this is likely just old. Their regular scrub doesnt leave a film all over you after using.",1

The Body Shop,Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,$12.00,"A disgusting greasy mess. It leaves a gross film all over you and it's nearly impossible to get off. I had to wash my entire body three times just to stop feeling sticky. It's also not even a scrub, it's more like a tub of crisco with a pinch of sand thrown in. There's not enough actual scrub in it to do anything. Smells nasty too. I swear I had bought this before and it was completely different so I don't know if they changed it or I'm delusional but it's awful. I would say it's overpriced but really it just shouldn't be sold at all.",1.5
The Body Shop,Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,$12.00,"I never leave comments, but this is AWFUL. Everythinv other reviewers said is true.",5
The Body Shop,Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,$12.00,"Agree with the other reviews. Texture is thick and like a paste. If the awful texture didn't stop you already, you would have to use 1/2 the tub for one shower because it doesn't thin out. No exfoliating at all. Finally leaves a residue that won't rinse off well. Would give 0 if possible as a rating",1
The Body Shop,Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,$12.00,"I am not exagerating this is the worst body scrub I have ever used. The texture of it is incredibly waxy and leaves an very thick film all over the skin, and it will leave a greasy layer all over your shower. It was incredibly hard to apply. Because the texture was so thick and waxy it did not just melt into the skin the way other sugar scrubs do. And finally the scent was FOUL. In the tub it wasn't too offensive but still smelled strongly of wax, almost like a candle or a crayon. Immediately after using it in the shower today with my usual body wash, I noticed that my skin smelled almost like burnt? I really have no other way to describe the smell besides sour burning hair. I have never in my life used a shower product that made me feel dirtier afterwards, but theres a first time for everything!",1
The Body Shop,Coconut Sugar Body Scrub,$12.00,Do not purchase. This product does not wash off or absorb. Leaves skin feeling awful.,1
